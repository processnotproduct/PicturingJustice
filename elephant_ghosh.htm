                  by Shubha Ghosh<br>
<br>
                  <i>Elephant</i>, the winner of the 2003 Palme d'Or at the Cannes
                  Film Festival, begins and ends with the image of clouds  rolling
                  onto a palish blue sky.  In between, the director Gus Van Sant
                  shows us the casual lives of several high school students as
                  their day explodes into a Columbine-style shooting.  Some of
                  the students we see die, some live.  We cannot predict which.
                   The spree killers are shown in various poses: as victim of spit
                  balls, as dorky teenager with distant parents, as student of
                  piano, as cruiser of the Internet in search of guns, as random
                  killer of administrators, staff, and classmates.  Bracketing
                  all this are the expansive skies filled only with clouds, silent,
                  unjudging.  At the end of the eighty minutes we are left with
                  no better knowledge of the demons we witnessed or the demons
                  that lurk out there.  Movies have charms to depict the savage
                  breast, but seemingly no ability to tame them.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/elephant.jpg" width="192" height="144" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The
                  movie has been described as bold in its uncompromising depiction
                  of nihilism.  One critic has described the movie as &quot;irresponsible&quot;
                  because van Sant offers no explanation for the event we are shown.
                   The tone of the movie is flat and unjudging.  As a result, we
                  are forced to recognize the urgent need to fill the void that
                  Van Sant has displayed and that leaves us empty. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The biggest question of all
                  is the identity of the eponymous elephant.  The obvious reference
                  is to the three blind men asked to identify an elephant, each
                  having one handle on the beast, the trunk or the tail or the
                  leg.   Certainly, Van Sant plays with perspective through the
                  movie, but the point is not to emphasize the relativity of reality.
                    Instead, we are forced to ask the difficult question, what
                  is the elephant that we are supposed to be seeing and the director
                  has chosen to shoot.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">One possible answer is that
                  the elephant is High School. Since most of the movies tracks
                  the meanderings of actual students through the hallways of an
                  actual high school in Portland, the director's hometown and the
                  transplanted locale of Columbine, High School seems a strong
                  candidate for the elephant.   Violence appears in quiet ways
                  even before the actual  shootings.   One student is seen dealing
                  with an alcoholic parent who runs into mailboxes on the drive
                  to school.   A female student is warned about flirting with a
                  boy because his girlfriend once slapped someone who did.   Another
                  student speaks nonchalantly about her fears of dying in a car
                  crash.  This is not school as envisioned by John Dewey. But we
                  are not shown Pink Floyd's vision either.   The movie does not
                  say anything particularly new or interesting about high school
                  life.  The point is that these high school lives are so ordinary
                  and uninteresting while their deaths are so dramatic.   If High
                  School's the elephant, the movie remains sad and depressing,
                  rather than tragic and cathartic.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Another possible, perhaps more
                  compelling, answer is that  the elephant is the Nature of Evil.
                   One of the most disturbing scenes for me occurred right before
                  the start of the shootings. Alex and Eric, the film's equivalents
                  of Dyland and Eric, are cutting school to watch television. 
                  A movie about the Third Reich is playing.   In the background,
                  we see through the living room window a Fed Ex truck pulling
                  into the driveway.  The driver rings the doorbell and cheerfully
                  drops off a large packet, which the kids quickly open to reveal
                  semi-automatic weapons.  Nazi rallies play on the television
                  as the show's narrator recounts the ascendancy of Hitler.  Eric
                  at that point asks Alex  the casual and telling, question: &quot;That's
                  Hitler, right?&quot;  The punch line illustrates  the ultimate
                  banality of evil, not to mention the failure of high school education.
                   It is worthwhile to note that one of the two shooters is named
                  Alex in the film, perhaps a reference to the protagonist of <i>A
                  Clockwork Orange</i>, Kubrick's film about youth violence and
                  society's inability to cure or repress it.   Van Sant really
                  makes no judgment about evil; he just shows it unfold.   Evil
                  is inevitable, he seems to be saying, and its nature is elusive.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">While the eponymous elephant
                  could be the Nature of Evil, a even more compelling candidate
                  is Fate.  To talk about evil is to assert a judgment, and it
                  is not clear that Van Sant necessarily views Alex and Eric as
                  evil people.  They act out, just like their fellow classmates
                  are shown acting out, but with far deadlier consequences.  The
                  final words in the film are &quot;Eenie-meenie-miney-mo&quot;
                  spoken by Alex as he waves his rifle back and forth between two
                  classmates pleading for their lives. The director, with this
                  ending, reminds us that these events are random. We can impose
                  some logic to them after we have seen the movie.  We can blame
                  Alex and Eric for being evil or deviants or their parents for
                  being neglectful or their school for being alienating.  But ultimately
                  shootings just happen, and a chance decision to go to the school
                  library rather than to the gym is the sole difference between
                  life and death.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">To see the elephant of the
                  film as Fate casts light on the aftermath of Columbine and the
                  spate of high school shootings that preceded and followed.  
                  Parents  and victims turn to the court system to find a solution.
                  Some call it closure; others justice.  The Kliebolds and the
                  Harrises, the school, the police, and even the manufacturer of
                  an anti-depressant that one of the shooter's was taking have
                  been blamed for the events.  <i>Elephant</i> reminds us that
                  placing of blame, while demanded by the law, is ultimately empty.
                   For many, this message disappoints.  Perhaps a more appropriate
                  title for the movie, given its seeming lack of a message,  would
                  have been Oakland.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But Van Sant does have a &quot;there&quot;
                  in his film. The message is for us, and generations after us,
                  to see what the horrors of Columbine must have been like.  While
                  legal scholars, social scientists, public intellectuals, and
                  moralizers will struggle  to understand why such spree killings
                  occur, the point in shooting van Sant's <i>Elephant</i> is to
                  never forget that they have occurred and could occur again. 
                   The more subtle point of this amazing movie is that perhaps
                  the best  film, and law, can do is make us remember. </font></p>
