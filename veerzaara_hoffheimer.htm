                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Yash Chopra's 2004 megahit
                  <i>Veer-Zaara</i> combines a &quot;feel good&quot; love story
                  and courtroom drama with running commentary on hot issues like
                  the status of women in South Asia, Indian prisoners in Pakistan,
                  and Hindu-Muslim relations. Virtually ignored by Western legal
                  pundits, <i>Veer-Zaara</i> should be required viewing.<br>
<br>
                  Even if you are not Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji or Preity Zinta
                  fan, the film's social and cultural impact commands attention.
                  <i>Veer-Zaara</i> was 2004's top grossing Bollywood film and
                  won Filmfare awards for best film, best lyrics, best story, and
                  best dialog. See <a href="http://filmfareawards.indiatimes.com/">filmfareawards.indiatimes.com</a>
                  (announcing 2004 film awards). Its song <i>Main Yahan Hoon</i>
                  (&quot;I am Here&quot;) still ranked as a top ten hit as of mid
                  2005.</font></p>

                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Lawyer-client interview</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/veerzaara.jpg" width="110" height="147" naturalsizeflag="0" align="LEFT">The
                  story opens with a lawyer-client interview set in a Pakistani
                  prison. Novice female Pakistani lawyer Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani
                  Mukerji). meets her court-appointed client Veer Pratap Singh
                  (Shah Rukh Khan). Imprisoned for twenty-two years on his own
                  false confession that he was a spy, Veer reveals he is an Indian
                  citizen.<br>
<br>
                  Flashback from the interviews presents the story of Veer falling
                  in love with a Pakistani citizen, Zaara Hyaat Khan (Preity Zinta),
                  when she visits India to dispose of the remains of her beloved
                  Sikh caregiver. When Veer later follows Zaara to Pakistan, corrupt
                  Pakistani officers in league with Zaara's jealous fianc&eacute;
                  coerce him into signing the false confession.<br>
<br>
                  Because Veer forbids Saamiya from contacting Zaara, the lawyer
                  must travel to India to find proof of Veer's true identity. There
                  she (spoiler alert!) discovers Zaara operating a school for girls.
                  Saamiya returns with Zaara. Veer and Zaara embrace in the middle
                  of the courtroom as cameras circle.</font></p>

                  truth</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Saamiya's courtroom triumph
                  does not just reunite lovers and secure Veer's liberty. It proves
                  the competence of women lawyers and vindicates the power of truth
                  to the sneering prosecutor who had insisted, &quot;It's not a
                  lawyer's job to decide what's right or wrong, it's a court's
                  job. A lawyer's job is to win the case under any circumstances.
                  Nothing else.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  Saamiya responds humbly, &quot;Well that's the difference between
                  you and me. Your principle is to fight to win and my principle
                  is to fight for the truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  When he loses, her adversary concedes, &quot;I'm giving up law
                  because you've taught me I'm not fit for this work.&quot; His
                  dialogue links truth to communal reconciliation: &quot;I always
                  thought that a country's progress is measured [by] its judicial
                  system. But now I understand that the future of both these countries
                  is in the hands of youngsters like you who do not measure humans
                  as big-small, man-woman, Hindu-Muslin, who don't rake up bitter
                  war memories of 1947, 1965 and 1999 on every pretext, who wish
                  to address the future with the truth and only the truth and there's
                  no stopping a country where truth prevails.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  The dialogue's point is reinforced visually. While the prosecutor
                  blesses Saamiya, the camera centers the two lawyers in front
                  of the bench, flanked by two Pakistani flags.</font></p>

                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Religious harmony</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This is Bollywood, so the fantasies
                  favor Hindus. At the border, Saamiya, a devout Muslim, offers
                  Veer vermillion, a traditional Hindu sign of marriage. As Veer
                  and Zaara cross the border, Veer kneels to kiss Indian soil.<br>
<br>
                  Nor is there much room for doubt as to who is to blame for religious
                  intolerance. Veer's adoptive parents extend Zaara a specially
                  warm welcome when they learn she is from Pakistan, and they urge
                  Veer to marry her. But Zaara's father insists on arranging her
                  marriage to the son of a political powerful Muslim.<br>
<br>
                  The film projects a casteless, open-handed Hindu spirit. Sikhs
                  appear repeatedly in peripheral roles where they mediate Muslim
                  and Hindu relations. Zaara' devotion to her Sikh bibi takes her
                  to India. Veer's Punjabi family celebrates Lohri collectively
                  with the village Sikh community.<br>
<br>
                  Over-the-top scenes--from a deathbed request to a helicopter
                  rescue--eclipse subtleties that reward close attention. Broad
                  depictions of Muslims should not blind Western viewers to the
                  film's welcome departure from convention in presenting (most)
                  Muslim characters in a positive light.<br>
<br>
                  The judge, who embodies the state of Pakistan, is fair-minded,
                  diligent, and empathetic. Even the rough Pakistani jailer redeems
                  himself on the witness stand.</font></p>

                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Nostalgia</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The role of law, specifically
                  courtroom legal process, in resolving disputes and restoring
                  family harmony reincarnates 50s law drama formulas, updating
                  pleas for social and penal reform to include advocacy of women's
                  rights, religious tolerance and international cooperation. One
                  of Yash Chopra's heroes is Raj Kapoor, and <i>Veer-Zaara</i>
                  pays sentimental tribute to Kapoor's <i>Awara</i> (1953), the
                  mother of Hindi law dramas and the greatest lawyer movie ever
                  made.<br>
<br>
                  Chopra's resort to nostalgia includes a soundtrack built on previously
                  unreleased songs by Madan Mohan (1924-1975) with new lyrics by
                  the liberal Muslim poet and activist Javed Akhtar. Even if the
                  music did not scream retro, the marketing did: The DVD and the
                  two-disc CD include recreations of the songs, and the CD adds
                  two bonus songs not pictured in the film. The DVD is available
                  from <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70024184&trkid=181026">NetFlix</a>
                  , <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009XBR5U/qid%3D1123200167/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/103-3653843-2656632">Amazon.com</a>

<br>
                  The film's multi-generational appeal includes the director's
                  son Aditya Chopra as story writer. Aditya himself directed DDLJ,
                  the longest screening hit (500-plus weeks) in Bollywood history.</font></p>

                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Border crossing</font></b></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Veer-Zaara</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">'s story associates border crossing
                  with both danger and romance. Sometimes border crossings may
                  carry too much romantic weight. You might get the idea that Veer's
                  family loves Zaara more than he does.<br>
<br>
                  Border crossing is also associated with loss of identity. Veer
                  loses his identity in Pakistan. Zaara's entry into India and
                  her later marriage to Veer rupture her identity with her past
                  life and threaten her loss of Muslim identity.<br>
<br>
                  The narrative resolution ambiguously permits a reading either
                  that she assimilates into a Hindu community or that she and Veer
                  preserve their religious differences in a secular community.
                  This ambiguous resolution echoes that of <i>Kabhi Khushi Kabhi
                  Gham</i> (2001) where Kajol's Muslim character appears with mangalsutra,
                  a Hindu sign of marriage.<br>
<br>
                  Veer-Zaara's union, however ambiguous, marks a departure from
                  Bollywood treatments of Hindu-Muslim romances which even in recent
                  years sometimes spelled the death of one lover, the disclosure
                  that the Hindu was really a Muslim--or both. For all its clich&eacute;s,
                  a commercial hit built on a love affair between Hindu and Muslim
                  reveals how far Bollywood leads Hollywood, where credible Black-white
                  romance is rarely attempted and, perhaps, still not achieved.<br>
<br>
                  Veer-Zaara's romance bristles with ironies that both reinforce
                  and subvert a traditionalist reading. Romantic love, strongly
                  associated with family identity, overcomes religious difference.
                  Love also overcomes patriotic militarism, for Veer does not hesitate
                  to renounce his glam career with the Indian Air Force in order
                  to visit Zaara in Pakistan. The ironies are coded onto the casting.
                  Muslim SRK plays the Hindu, while Hindu Rani Mukerji plays the
                  Muslim.<br>
<br>
                  The plot exhibits a theme that has emerged as a common structural
                  element in Bollywood romances since the 90s. Its happy ending
                  leaves one of the protagonists uncoupled--and without the prospect
                  of immediate coupling. Just as <i>Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam</i>
                  ends with Salman Khan seeking comfort from his dead father while
                  Ajay and Ash pair up, <i>Veer-Zaara</i> leaves Saamiya at her
                  father's grave while Veer and Zaara walk into the sunset.</font></p>

                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Lawyers as lovers</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Where <i>Veer-Zaara</i> falls
                  short is on the capacity of lawyers to be lovers. There is a
                  tension between the son's screenplay and the father's direction.
                  How can Saamiya help falling in love with Veer?<br>
<br>
                  Ingredients of the story--Veer's captivity, idealism, status
                  as orphan, even his love of Saamiya's mother's cooking--suggest
                  the vulnerability and romantic compatibility of their characters.
                  Moreover, prior screen pairings of SRK and Rani Mukerji suggest
                  the danger of a romance.<br>
<br>
                  The director's pedagogic goal of presenting Saamiya's single-minded
                  devotion to justice keep him from developing any amorous interest
                  between her and her client. In this the film differs from the
                  classical melodramas of the 50s in which Raj Kapoor, Bimal Roy
                  and Mehboob Khan regularly explored romantic ambivalence as a
                  source of social conflict.<br>
<br>
                  Comparing <i>Veer-Zaara</i> to Bollywood classics may even support
                  the generalization that while older Hindi melodrama imposed ambiguity
                  on characters who were emotionally indecisive (Devdas) or morally
                  conflicted (Kapoor's eponymous Raj), contemporary Bollywood imposes
                  ambiguity on the plot, permitting a variety of readings to suit
                  different constituencies.</font></p>

                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Law and revenge</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">What <i>Veer-Zaara</i> loses
                  in emotional edge it gains in didacticism. Like traditional Bollywood
                  law dramas, the courtroom offers Veer a platform to address political
                  concerns. He neither denounces corruption nor demands retribution.
                  Instead he reads a poem expressing wonder at the identity of
                  Muslim and Hindu. The poem's universalist message simultaneously
                  advocates communal harmony in India and promotes international
                  friendship between Pakistan and India.<br>
<br>
                  Since <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> (1844-45), wrongful imprisonment
                  and loss of a beloved have formed the mythic foundations of revenge-genre
                  melodrama. <i>Veer-Zaara</i>'s refusal to identify justice with
                  vengeance differentiates the film from most Bollywood and Hollywood
                  fare.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Veer-Zaara</i> envisages law as a force capable of surmounting
                  national barriers and resolving personal and international disputes.
                  The film does not present law's incapacity to restore the past
                  as a deficit that requires individual agency.<br>
<br>
                  At a time when escapist fantasy often castes lawyers as demons,
                  <i>Veer-Zaara</i> reminds us of alternative traditions where
                  law works to reveal true identities and lawyers serve as reconcilers
                  and healers. The film's commercial success proves the renewed
                  appeal of such fantasy in South Asia.</font></p>
