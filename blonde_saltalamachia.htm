            Let me suggest a few things that we can learn about law and popular
            culture from this episode.  First, we as law professors don't
            have the slightest idea what &quot;popular culture&quot; actually
            is and we are only fooling ourselves if we do.  Second, we are
            clueless about what our students like to do, watch, listen to,
            drink, think about, etc.  If we try to &quot;relate&quot; to
            them, we make ourselves look and feel ridiculous.</font></center>

                  by Prof. Joyce Saltalamachia</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I decided to see <i>Legally
                  Blonde</i> last summer because it had three big things going
                  for it: it had gotten universally positive reviews; it was a
                  goofy comedy which automatically made it good summer fare; and
                  it was about law school.  I didn't expect, or want, anything
                  of substance, so was not disappointed.  In fact, it was generally
                  so ridiculous that the scenes that might have annoyed me (She
                  studied really hard for a week and got near perfect LSATs.  Yeah,
                  sure.  She won a murder trial as a first-year student.  Oh, really?),
                  but these occurrences fit right in with the overall wackiness
                  of the story.  It was just a movie after all.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I was gratified, however, to
                  see that one of the law professors portrayed was a woman.  This
                  was definitely a step in the right direction and indicated a
                  certain amount of gender sensitivity, plus a nod to the very
                  real fact that a lot of law professors actually are women.  In
                  fact, Prof. Stromwell taught Elle's very first class,  in what
                  I thought was an hilarious parody of the popular notion of how
                  a typical law school class is conducted.  At this class, she
                  strides in  and writes on the board, &quot;Law is reason free
                  from passion.&quot;  &quot;Law is reason free from passion,&quot;
                  she intones.  &quot;Who said this?&quot;  Anyone familiar with
                  a modern law school class will immediately see the humor in this.
                   First, instead of being written on the board the quote would
                  actually be part of a PowerPoint presentation, and second, we're
                  usually concerned with more earthly matters on the first day,
                  like &quot;Who's bought the book,&quot; &quot;Who's read the
                  assignment&quot; and so on.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Back to the movie.  As Stromwell
                  glares at the terrified students one timidly raises his hand.
                   &quot;Aristotle?&quot; he asks.  &quot;Are you sure of this?&quot;
                   she growls.  &quot;Yes.&quot;  &quot;Would  you bet your life
                  on it?&quot;  She ups the ante.  &quot;Yes&quot; again, but very
                  slowly.  &quot;Would you bet <b>his</b> life on it?&quot; and
                  she clunks a nearby student on the head with a pointer, clearly
                  indicating that she would be fully prepared to take him as a
                  human sacrifice if Aristotle is wrong.  The tension is high and
                  the first student finally breaks down.  Stromwell ultimately
                  concedes that Aristotle had made the statement, and she moves
                  on to torture another hapless victim.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Where to start?  In a real
                  class you would be so delighted to have a volunteer tackle a
                  question not directly related to the reading that you would likely
                  grovel in gratitude.  The fact that the answer was correct would
                  be almost too much to bear.  The message in law schools nowadays
                  is to be more nurturing to the students, so that the old intimidation
                  game, if it ever existed, is long gone.  &quot;Look to the left
                  of you, look to the right of you...&quot; is a dim memory.  Course
                  evaluation forms regularly ask students to rate the &quot;respectfulness&quot;
                  of the teacher.  And to actually <b>strike</b> a student, with
                  a pointer or otherwise, would be a one-way ticket to TIAA-CREF-
                  land.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">All these changes were badly
                  needed and have done much to improve the atmosphere and civility
                  of legal education, so it amused me to see the old stereotypes
                  being still presented in this film.  Perhaps, I thought, I could
                  have some fun with this in the fall when I meet with my first
                  year Torts class.  Like many schools, we see our new students
                  first in an orientation session, at which time we introduce ourselves
                  and our subjects before the actual course work starts in earnest.
                   Surely most of the students would have seen the movie already
                  and would recall this classroom scene.  I fancied myself a Professor
                  Stromwell type (of a certain age, professional appearance, commanding
                  presence) so I thought that the joke would go over well.  The
                  students would recognize the parody and they would see that I
                  was a with-it sort of person who goes to goofy summer movies
                  just like they do.  Someone with a sense of humor who, in spite
                  of being older than most of their parents, is actually pretty
                  <b>cool</b>.  After all, I went to Berkeley.  In the Sixties.
                   I'm really nearly one of them, and they should recognize this
                  right away.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Orientation day came and I
                  could hardly wait for class and the opportunity to play the joke
                  and get the class started off on a humorous, nurturing footing.
                   I strode into class to be greeted by 45 apprehensive stares.
                   &quot;Law is reason free from passion&quot; I wrote on the board.
                   &quot;Who said this?&quot;  I asked.  Silence.  &quot;Who knows
                  who said this?&quot; I repeated.  No volunteers and the 45 stares
                  were starting to turn glassy.  &quot;Anyone want to take a guess
                  who said this?  Anyone think Aristotle said this?&quot;  By now
                  I was desperate just to get myself out of this hole.  &quot;Didn't
                  any of you see '<i>Legally Blonde</i>' over the summer?&quot;
                   Forty-five heads shake &quot;no.&quot;   &quot;This was a movie
                  about law school,&quot; I'm ranting by now.  &quot;Weren't any
                  of you even curious to see how law school is portrayed in the
                  movies?&quot;  Apparently the answer was still &quot;no,&quot;
                  since not a single one of them had thought it worth the time
                  and money to see one of the more popular movies of the summer
                  in spite of the fact that they were all about to become law students
                  themselves. I finally assigned them to see the movie over the
                  weekend and moved on to the topic of Torts, broken in spirit.
                   My joke had fallen flat. Not only did they not see me as someone
                  who was <b>cool</b>, they all clearly thought I was a lunatic.</font></p>


                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Let me suggest a few things
                  that we can learn about law and popular culture from this episode.
                   First, we as law professors don't have the slightest idea what
                  &quot;popular culture&quot; actually is and we are only fooling
                  ourselves if we do.  Second, we are clueless about what our students
                  like to do, watch, listen to, drink, think about, etc.  If we
                  try to &quot;relate&quot; to them, we make ourselves look and
                  feel ridiculous.  They may occasionally condescend to try to
                  relate to us (&quot;Please tell us again about seeing the Beatles
                  in Shea Stadium, Professor.&quot;) but we have to recognize this
                  as blatant pandering.  They want us to be teachers.  They want
                  the roles clearly defined and delimited.  Law school is one thing,
                  &quot;their&quot; movies, television, music are other things
                  entirely different. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I am sure anyone reading this
                  is practically frothing at the mouth by now.  After all, it is
                  posted on a web site designed by law professors devoted to law
                  and popular culture. And I am sure that every one can supply
                  me with many fine examples of how you use popular culture in
                  your classes.  Certainly, popular culture can be a useful tool
                  for the academic study of law.  But as law professors we are
                  probably in the worst position of any profession to recognize
                  what is &quot;popular&quot; and what is &quot;culture.&quot;
                   It isn't possible to find legal relevance in every episode of
                  <i>Ally McBeal</i> and our students are watching MTV and BattleBots
                  anyway.  If you use the word <b>cool</b> you probably aren't.
                   In the end, it's only a movie.  </font>   </p>
