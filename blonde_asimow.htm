                  By Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Legally Blonde</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is a pretty good law school comedy
                  and a pretty bad courtroom comedy. As summer movie fare goes,
                  that isn't such a bad average.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Blond bombshell Elle Woods
                  (the Elle comes from Amanda Chang's clever book title--One Elle)
                  gets into Harvard Law School on the strength of a smashing 179
                  LSAT and a 4.0 in fashion merchandising-- plus a dazzling video
                  (submitted in lieu of the usual essay). She's at Harvard to chase
                  her former boyfriend and despite the advice of her parents that
                  lawyers are ugly, boring and serious. She is definitely none
                  of the above.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/legally blonde 6.jpg" width="192" height="129" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In
                  what I thought was a hilarious spoof of an Admissions Committee
                  meeting, the dazzled old fuds on the committee admit Elle in
                  the diversity category. Then follows an amusing culture clash:
                  Elle, a Bel Air airhead (who lived across the street from Aaron
                  Spelling) runs headlong into Cambridge snobbery. Her classmates
                  can't see anymore than a Malibu Barbie and her professors are
                  a bunch of bullies and fools. Professor Callahan, apparently
                  a practicing lawyer in a big firm, is a full professor teaching
                  first year criminal law at Harvard. He enlists students as free
                  help on his cases and he sexually harasses Elle.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The law school class scenes
                  perpetuate the notion that what happens in the classroom is a
                  bunch of pointless bullying. We learned this from <i>Paper Chase</i>
                  and it was reinforced in other law school movies--particularly
                  <i>Just Cause</i> and <i>Soul Man</i> (a thoroughly tasteless
                  law school comedy which is also pretty funny). In Elle's first
                  class, she isn't prepared since she didn't know there was an
                  assignment--and the professor throws her out of the classroom.
                  This scene was reminiscent of <i>Paper Chase</i>, in which the
                  same thing happens to Hart who is then abused pitilessly by Kingsfield.
                  Actually, a better law school teaching scene occurs in <i>The
                  Pelican Brief</i>--in which a teacher and student engage in a
                  reasonably productive interchange about an issue of legal policy;
                  it is spoiled, however, in the next scene when we find teacher
                  and student in bed together.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The fact is that law school
                  classes no longer consist of sadistic professors humiliating
                  helpless students or asking them moronic questions that have
                  no possible educational utility. Instead, what goes on, more
                  often than not, is real learning. Dedicated teachers are transmitting
                  vital analytical skills and debating interesting policy issues
                  with highly engaged students. True, the classes are too big and
                  the Socratic method is inefficient, and the intensity level drops
                  way off after the first year, but the movies never scratch the
                  surface of what law school is really about or address the real
                  problems of contemporary legal education. Still, I thought that
                  the various scenes involving Elle's socialization into law school
                  ways were pretty funny. Reese Witherspoon carries off the part
                  with great flair and I, for one, enjoyed it.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But I didn't much like the
                  courtroom scenes. The bar for courtroom comedies is quite high--<i>My
                  Cousin Vinny</i>, <i>Bananas</i>, <i><a href="articles/TimetoKillAdamsRib.htm">Adam's
                  Rib</a></i>, <i><a href="articles/RoxieHart.htm">Roxie
                  Hart</a></i>, or <i>Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</i> set the standard.
                  These classic pictures are very funny and they satirize the courtroom
                  process and the law to great effect. By comparison, <i>Legally
                  Blonde</i> is strictly bush league. Comedy needs to have a target,
                  to be about something--it works best when it is most destructive.
                  The film slices and dices law school and law students with gusto.
                  Not so in the courtroom scenes.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Here's where Elle joins Callahan's
                  team of lawyers and law students to work on a murder case. The
                  client is accused of killing her much older and very wealthy
                  husband. This part is carelessly written and plotted and the
                  airhead humor wears thin. At best, it is a pallid takeoff on
                  the tiresome old Perry Mason routine of finding the killer in
                  the courtroom.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Elle is the only one of the
                  legal team to establish rapport with the client (who is her former
                  aerobics teacher)--that, at least, makes a valid point. She puts
                  her knowledge of fashion to work by figuring out that a witness
                  who testifies to an affair with the defendant is really gay because
                  he knows shoe designers. Not bad.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The client then fires Callahan
                  and hires Elle, a first year student to head the legal team.
                  They cite the right rule--Massachusetts Rule of Court 3.03--but
                  that rule emphatically does not permit a first year student to
                  represent a wealthy client in a major criminal case (even under
                  the supervision of a practicing lawyer). Instead, the rule applies
                  only to senior law students who have taken a course in evidence
                  or trial practice and are representing the state or an indigent
                  client. Needless to say, Elle doesn't fit any part of the rule
                  and is totally clueless in the courtroom. Nevertheless, by incredible
                  luck she gets the true killer to confess.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So the film is an engaging
                  bit of piffle with some worthwhile things to say about law school
                  and eastern snobs, but no good ideas when it comes to the courtroom.</font></p>
