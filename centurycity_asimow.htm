                  RESEMBLE THOSE OF THE PAST: <i>CENTURY CITY</i></font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow<br>
<br>
                  What if you took the law firm of McKenzie, Brackman from <i>L.
                  A. Law</i> and fast-forwarded it to the year 2030? You'd have
                  a law firm a lot like the firm in CBS' promising new law series
                  <i>Century City</i>.<br>
<br>
                  <i>L. A. Law</i>'s successful run lasted from 1986 until 1994
                  . The show was a real breakthrough for law-oriented TV programming.
                  It dealt with law the way it's practiced today--in firms and
                  for profit--and thus updated the stale <i>Perry Mason-Matlock</i>
                  format. Its crew of appealing actors worked well together in
                  ensemble form. Each week the show tackled interesting legal and
                  ethical issues. It didn't neglect the personal lives of the lawyers.
                  <i>L.A. Law</i> usually presented enough toothsome legal issues
                  to make it worth watching, even if you didn't care about the
                  characters' sex lives. Generically <i>L.A. Law</i> was a workplace
                  drama, like <i>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</i>,<i> E. R.</i>, or
                  <i>M*A*S*H</i>, in which the characters' personal and professional
                  lives revolve around their place of employment.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Century City</i> seems consciously modeled on <i>L. A. Law</i>.
                  We're going to learn a lot about the personal lives of the lawyers.
                  And the characters seem strangely familiar. There's the avuncular
                  senior partner-Leland McKenzie becomes Martin Constable. Or the
                  cynical, money-grubbing, sexually harassing partner-Douglas Brackman
                  becomes Darwin McNeil. There's ethnic diversity - Jonathan Rollins
                  becomes Hannah Crane. And ambitious female associates-Ann Kelsey
                  and Abby Perkins become Lee May Bristol (who's genetically engineered
                  to be the perfect lawyer). We've got idealistic young lawyers-Michael
                  Kuzak becomes Lukas Gold-and aggressive but principled prosecutors-Grace
                  Van Owen becomes Matthew Chin.<br>
<br>
                  The firm of Crane, Constable, McNeil &amp; Montero firm is set
                  right smack in the same neck of the woods as <i>L. A. Law-Century
                  City</i> is a hive of corporate law firms about 10 miles west
                  of downtown L. A. As in <i>L.A. Law</i>, the Constable firm is
                  small, hungry for business, and definitely upscale. Its beautiful
                  office space in <i>Century City</i> is nothing like the crummy
                  Boston office in <i>The Practice</i>. <br>
<br>
                  The original twist in <i>Century City</i> is that it marries
                  the sci-fi genre with the law genre by setting the time ahead
                  to 2030. There's lots of neat little futuristic tricks like virtual
                  reality pretrial conferences with the judge, much better video
                  games and cosmetic surgery, super-duper genetic technology, and
                  cherries without pits. The only implausible premise is that L.
                  A. has a cool monorail system. Dream on. <br>
<br>
                  You know what? I liked the premiere episode and I'm rooting for
                  the Crane, Constable firm-and the show-to succeed. It's just
                  so much better than the unlamented <i>Ally McBeal</i> or the
                  really dumb law firm series that appeared and swiftly disappeared
                  in the last few years (<i>The Girls' Club, The First Years</i>).
<br>
<br>
                  I think the idea of focusing on cutting-edge bio-tech issues
                  is promising. Both the premiere's serious A story (having to
                  do with organ harvesting from cloned embryos) and humorous B
                  story (concerning a contract whereby members of a rock band promise
                  to stay eternally young) were pretty interesting. There is a
                  wealth of good story ideas here. I like the struggle between
                  the business and professional models of law firms, as young associate
                  Lukas Gold persuades the reluctant older heads that he should
                  take on a big pro bono case. I liked the way the young lawyers
                  talk about why they became lawyers and the partners talk about
                  the stresses of law practice. <br>
<br>
                  And I'm happy to see balanced presentations of law firms. The
                  usual pop culture approach to law firms is to portray them as
                  nests of unadulterated evil. John Grisham does this in nearly
                  every one of his books. Films like <i>The Devil's Advocate, The
                  Firm, Regarding Henry, Philadelphia</i> and numerous others drum
                  out variations on this theme. David Kelley's <i>The Girl's Club</i>
                  was more of the same. Now, I'm no fan of large law firms, but
                  they're not that bad. <i>Century City</i>, like <i>L.A. Law</i>
                  before it, keeps things in perspective. Like the hospitals, police
                  stations, space ships, TV studios, and the other sites of workplace
                  television drama, there is good and bad in law firms and in the
                  lawyers who play out their personal and professional existences
                  there. <br>
<br>
                  So more power to you <i>Century City</i>! May you find your audience
                  before you're bleeped by low ratings. <br>
