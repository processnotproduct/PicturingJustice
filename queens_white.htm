                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Libby A. White<br>
<br>
                  After viewing the first two episodes of <i>Queens Suprem</i>e,
                  CBS' mid-season submission to the Friday night lineup (10:00
                  p.m.), I'm still wondering why the powers-that-be at CBS thought
                  it was a brilliant idea to begin the season with the second episode
                  and follow it up with the first. Perhaps they thought that Kristen
                  Johnston's (<i>Third Rock from the Sun</i>) guest appearance
                  as a furious, trying-to-be-ex-wife of Judge Jack Moran (played
                  by Oliver Platt) in the opening scene was the attention grabber
                  to set the season. Or perhaps they decided that being mysterious
                  about who is who and what's it all about would get viewers to
                  tune in at least one more time.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/queens3.jpg" width="108" height="174" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">For
                  whatever reason, I had the following questions after the &quot;first&quot;
                  episode: 1) who is a judge and who is a law clerk ; 2) why do
                  people seem to hate (a new judge?) Kim Vicidomini (played by
                  Anabella Sciorra); and 3) what is wrong with Judge Moran? After
                  the second episode, the answers are clearer (more on that later).
                  However, I'm still wondering why Judge Moran and Judge Vicidomini
                  carry guns, why they seem to have a hard time keeping them out
                  of the hands of crazed people (more on that later), and if someone
                  will be shooting a gun into a ceiling or window every episode.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Queens Supreme</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> has been touted as a &quot;seriocomedy,&quot;
                  that is, a comedy with serious overtones. The setting is the
                  Queens County Courthouse in New York City, staffed by four Supreme
                  Court Justices (that's what the lower court judges are called
                  there), two law clerks, and some security personnel who tend
                  to be rather free with their guns. Because Queens is the most
                  ethnically diverse community in the United States (according
                  to the producers), there is an inexhaustible supply of characters
                  and nationalities that could pass through the Queens courtrooms.
                  In addition to Judges Moran and Vicidomini, there is the senior
                  judge, Thomas O'Neill (Robert Loggia, reprising his usual role
                  of wise, reasonable, and sympathetic paternal figure) and Judge
                  Rose Barena (L. Scott Caldwell). The law clarks are Mike Powell
                  (James Madio, known best from &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;) and
                  Marcy Harriel (Carmen Hui).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the &quot;first&quot; episode,
                  after following Judge Moran's wife marching through the courthouse
                  as she tries to find him to sign the divorce papers, we meet
                  Jack Moran. Oliver Platt, a distant relative of Orson Welles
                  (there is a resemblance), plays the central character as a cynical,
                  lovable judge, trying to do good, but going, and acting, a little
                  nuts along the way. He escapes his wife by holing up in his courtroom,
                  attempting to force a hopelessly deadlocked jury to come to decision
                  in a case in which a smoker died of a heart attack, presumably
                  caused by the stress of trying to stop smoking.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The jury is deadlocked because
                  one of the six jurors, who is a heavy smoker himself, thinks
                  the &quot;Butt Breakers&quot; clinic negligently caused the heart
                  attack. Because the jury has been deliberating for three days,
                  the juror holdout is suffering from severe nicotine deprivation.
                  Judge Moran's order to the jury to come to a decision is the
                  catalyst for the smoker to disrupt the courtroom, steal the bailiff's
                  gun, and hold the jury, Judge, bailiff, and law clerk Mike as
                  hostages while he blissfully smokes away in the courtroom (&quot;don't
                  mess with a man and his cigarette&quot;). When tempers get a
                  little hot with the hostages, the juror shoots out a window.
                  At that point, Judge Moran decides to give his gun to the juror
                  as a measure of trust (now that's reality) and then argues the
                  juror's &quot;case&quot; to the jury to show him that he will
                  have a chance at redemption if he lets them go. His argument
                  that sometimes perfectly normal people just &quot;make a mistake&quot;
                  works, and the juror gives up the gun and his hostages. One of
                  the jurors turns to Judge Moran and remarks, &quot;You're a better
                  lawyer than you were a judge.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The &quot;second&quot; episode
                  (directed by Tim Robbins) introduces the courtroom in Queens,
                  the main characters, and their relationships. We learn that Judge
                  Vicidomini is a novice political appointee, with an in at City
                  Hall. Judge Bornea is the most critical of her and her lack of
                  experience, suggesting that she &quot;slept&quot; her way to
                  the job. We also find out that City Hall, namely the Mayor, is
                  very unhappy with Judge Moran and wants him off the bench because
                  he has called the Mayor a &quot;fascist,&quot; and because he
                  is too easy on criminal defendants and doesn't following sentencing
                  guidelines. The Bureau of Court Administration decides to suspend
                  Moran for these reasons and for his unorthodox behavior, which
                  includes: 1) singing &quot;Trouble, Right in River City,&quot;
                  from <i>The Music Man</i>, from the bench to illustrate that
                  just because an elderly woman exercises her First Amendment right
                  to speak (or sing), even if only to herself, does not mean she
                  is incompetent to run her business; and 2) appropriating an amputated
                  penis from a medical malpractice case so he can take a picture
                  of it with him and his law books.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Judge Vicidomini also has an
                  interesting time on her first day as a judge when an outraged
                  father of a rape victim steals her gun and threatens to kill
                  the rapists. Judge Moran intervenes and shoots his gun into the
                  ceiling to scare the father into giving up. He does. Judge Vicidomini
                  also manages to settle the penis case, and then uses her connections
                  as a &quot;Republican Italian&quot; to convince the Mayor to
                  reinstate Moran as a judge.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Queens Supreme</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> was conceived by the twin lawyer sons
                  of Queens County Supreme Court Justice Charles J. Thomas, Peter
                  and Daniel Thomas. While they propose to use real &quot;war stories&quot;
                  from their and others' experiences in the courtroom, they admit
                  to some artistic license, including the universal use of the
                  gavel (not used much in real life). So far, it appears perfectly
                  acceptable for judges to be as fully involved, if not more so,
                  than the lawyers in the presentation of evidence, questioning
                  of witnesses, and settling of cases. This makes sense for a show
                  that is focused on trial court judges. Otherwise the reality
                  of motion practice, preliminary hearings, deadly dull direct
                  and cross examinations, and judges who should act more as courtroom
                  referees than as players would not be too entertaining for the
                  average TV audience.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The action is fast, with quick
                  cuts to two or three-person conversations that are intense, but
                  often interlaced with wit and caustic humor, mostly provided
                  by Jack Moran. Oliver Platt has excellent timing and is already
                  well within his character's skin. He introduces just enough self-deprecation
                  and self-criticism to avoid being either too preachy or too irritating
                  in his humor. The remaining characters need more flesh and of
                  course, that will come with time, but the most interesting one
                  so far is the law clerk Mike who adds a certain zing to every
                  scene, perhaps because James Madio is so charismatic. There is
                  actually little time in the courtroom, which is a shame, since
                  courtroom scenes are great for showcasing oratory and analytical
                  skills, not to mention lessons in group dynamics. For a show
                  that is set in a courthouse, with the main characters as judges,
                  what they actually do for their living is not obvious.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The question is, will it last?
                  A well-known and respected cast, top producers (including Aaron
                  Spelling and Julia Roberts), and <i>A List</i> directors are
                  great ingredients for a successful run. But with any successful
                  show, the writers make all the difference. I'm already concerned
                  that the characters and stories will be one-dimensional, repetitive
                  and therefore, boring. The first two episodes had many of the
                  same ingredients: Judge Moran acting crazy, but then making sense;
                  Judge Vicidomini seemingly unsure, but then succeeding like a
                  veteran; normal people pulling guns on others because of stress
                  in the courtroom (and guns going off), and Judge Moran saving
                  the day; Judge Barnea criticizing Judge Vicidomini; Judge O'Neill
                  acting as the voice of reason; judges listening to their juries
                  through a bathroom vent; and finally, lawyers looking, and acting,
                  like idiots in the courtroom. It will be interesting to see if
                  the writers can go beyond these beginning themes and give &quot;Queens
                  Supreme&quot; some depth and breadth. If not, the initial challenge
                  of figuring out the first episode may, in hindsight, have been
                  the most entertaining part of the show.<br>
