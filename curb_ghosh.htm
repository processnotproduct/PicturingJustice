                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If the show <i>Seinfeld</i>
                  was about nothing, then its descendent <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>
                  is about everything.  Both programs are the creative spawn of
                  Larry David, and while the show about two neurotics Jews, a shiksa,
                  and an  inveterate shlemiel applied the microscope to the minute
                  details of our lives (like the placement of a button on a shirt,
                  a bit that began and ended the series), David's current show
                  about the insane in Los Angeles (where else?) tries in every
                  episode to connect all the details into one big picture.   In
                  the first episode of <i>Curb</i>, for example, David's obsession
                  with the fold of his pants leads to erectile confusion with his
                  wife's friend, a resulting family squabble, and a series of lies
                  that does not end well for our anti-hero.  In my favorite episode,
                  David's decision to be nice to a child leads to an elaborate
                  plot involving a doll's head, a broken bathroom door, a bottle
                  of water, and an angry mob that menacingly descends on David
                  at the end of the half hour.   In <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>,
                  a whole lot of nothing leads to something both bewildering and
                  exhilarating.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/curb.jpg" width="184" height="81" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">That
                  something is a smart picture of what life is like in the anticommons.
                   For those of you who are not property theorists, or do not pursue
                  legal theory as a hobby, the anticommons describes a world where
                  everything is private.  There is no public space, communally
                  shared or enjoyed.  The world, both physical and metaphysical,
                  is sliced up into individual rights, guarded religiously.   
                  The anticommons is the opposite of the more familiar commons,
                  a world where nothing is private and excessive sharing leads
                  to overuse of resources and eventual decline and fall.   In the
                  commons, individuals allow their cattle to overgraze the unrestricted
                  pastures. In the anticommons, merely looking at someone else's
                  cattle can be cause for social sanction.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The world of <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>,
                  which is either real Los Angeles or Los Angeles as extended metaphor,
                  is undoubtedly an anticommons.  When Larry David discards an
                  apple core in a trash can by the side of the street, the owner
                  of the trash can reacts viscerally, threatening to kick David's
                  and anyone else's ass the next time the can is so violated. 
                    (Unfortunately, the next perpetrator turns out to be Ted Danson,
                  who takes off in flight when the trash can owner sees him defile
                  his precious property.)   The citizens of the anti-commons are
                  not only hypersensitive, they are shrewd and cunning in negotiating
                  their self-interest to satisfy even the most trivial wants and
                  needs.  In an episode entitled &quot;The Wire,&quot;  David and
                  his wife attempt to convince their neighbors to help defray the
                  costs of putting an ugly, overhead wire underground.   In exchange
                  for their agreement, the neighbors ask for only one thing: a
                  meeting with Julia Louise Dreyfuss, the female lead in <i>Seinfeld</i>.
                    The episode turns into the typical mess, this time involving
                  the failure to coordinate schedules, an overzealous fan with
                  a videocamera appropriating Dreyfuss' image, and David's little
                  black book that could very well have been stolen by someone in
                  the Dreyfuss' household.  At the end of the episode, negotiations
                  break down, the offensive wire remains above ground, and the
                  Davids decide, out of necessity, to buy a new house.  In the
                  anticommons, small transgressions become magnified through the
                  fluttering of easily ruffled wings.   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The anticommons is a world
                  with too many individual rights, and in every episode of <i>Curb
                  Your Enthusiasm</i>, rights not only talk, they shout out, sometimes
                  gratingly, more often with great insight.    Perhaps the two
                  best episodes that illustrate just how profound the show can
                  be about rights  are the ones  entitled &quot;Affirmative Action&quot;
                  and &quot;The Group.&quot;   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In &quot;Affirmative Action,&quot;
                   Larry David does what no person has ever done before on television
                  or, perhaps in real life (certainly in academics): admit that
                  he is completely clueless about race.   The episode begins with
                  David unintentionally insulting his friend's dermatologist by
                  asking, in presence of the African-American dermatologist: &quot;You
                  have him as a doctor? With affirmative action and all?&quot;
                   Needless to say, the offended dermatologist storms off, and
                  David's friend asks (as all David's friends are wont to do):
                  &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;  David gives the most honest
                  response imaginable: &quot;I just don't know what to say to black
                  people&quot;.   While some may use the incident to comment on
                  the need for sensitivity, and others to comment on the hypersensitivity
                  of minorities, and others yet to revive vestigal racial attitudes,
                  which are far from defunct, David has the guts to admit that
                  he, as privileged white male, just may not have all the answers.
                  He portrays himself neither as savior or as villain, but as a
                  clueless guy, just bumbling along.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The rest of the episode is
                  a brilliantly choreographed power play as David finds himself
                  having to get back into the good graces of the dermatologist
                  in order to have his wife's prescription for a skin rash medication
                  filled. Following a path strewn with insulted maitre d's and
                  irate pharmacists, the Davids wind up in the living room of the
                  dermatologist with a gathering of his equally successful African-American
                  friends.  With his wife scratching an itch next to him, David
                  squirms to explain his earlier comment and return into good favor
                  through supplication..  David, however, falls from grace again
                  when one of the guests emerges from the bathroom and starts berating
                  him for not having any African-American characters on <i>Seinfeld</i>.
                     Rights scream, but the show is not cacophonous.  The episode
                  demonstrates the complicated maneuvering that is mandated in
                  a post-civil rights world, where everyone is conscious at some
                   level of societal injustices, but ultimately clueless on how
                  to negotiate the racist demons of the past and their present
                  incarnations.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A different type of oppression
                  and victimhood is the subject of &quot;The Group,&quot; an episode
                  in which David attends an incest survivor group to support a
                  friend and shares a wholly fabricated story about being molested
                  by an uncle as a child.    When a member of the group, played
                  by Lorraine Newman, meets the uncle at the end of the episode,
                  the true incest survivor takes out her anger on the fictional
                  oppressor.   While David's  story of abuse is certainly a contrived
                  plot device, the need to make up such a story is consistent with
                  David's character and the episode's representation of victimhood.
                    David's character seems to suffer from a persecution complex,
                  perhaps exacerbated by the hypersensitivities of everyone he
                  encounters.   He sees himself as perpetual victim and consequently
                  acts out in a ways that brings out the victim in others.   Some
                  undoubtedly would take offense in even broaching the subject
                  of incest in a humourous manner.  But the point is to illustrate
                  the dynamic of victimhood and the need to lash out at the oppressor,
                  even a wholly imagined one.  Rights do not talk or scream in
                  the episode, but signify the power play among individuals in
                  a fractured and fragmented world.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>
                  was solely about people getting mad at each other over trivial
                  or grave transgressions, the show would be no different from
                  reality television.  But there seems to be a trajectory to the
                  series over the three seasons that I, HBO-deprived, have been
                  able to spot on the recently released DVDs.   The first season
                  set the framework for the world as anticommons.   The second
                  season turned up the volume on this motif through a series of
                  absolutely brilliant episodes that gave depth to the fractionalized
                  world.   The third season, however, struck me as less impressive
                  and entertaining than the other two. While this change in tone
                  was disappointing, my reaction to the third season did not reflect
                  a decline in the show's quality.  Instead, the episodes of the
                  third season show the characters attempting to find a moral center
                  and retreat from their well-honed self-absorption.   The lack
                  of edge to the third reason reflects the dilemma of moving out
                  of the quagmire of the anticommons.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">For example, in the episode
                  entitled &quot;The Terrorist Attack,&quot; David is told in confidence
                  that Los Angeles is about to be attacked by terrorists.  After
                  a failed attempt to use the threat to get out of an obligation
                  to attend a fund raising event with his wife, David uses the
                  information to negotiate good will with the wife of a friend,
                  whom he feels he has snubbed.   The self-serving moves are not
                  surprising.  What is different is that David, for some reason,
                  cares about the opinion or feeling of another human being.  
                   In &quot;The Special Section,&quot; this nascent empathy takes
                  on a deeper dimension.   David returns to Los Angeles from a
                  business trip in New York to be informed by his father that his
                  mother has passed away (and that the funeral was last Monday).
                    For the first time, David seems distraught and emotionally
                  devastated.  That feeling appears shortlived when David tries
                  to use his mother's death as negotiable currency to extricate
                  himself from social obligations.  But the feeling makes a shining
                  and memorable reappearance when David learns that his mother
                  was buried in a special section of the Jewish cemetery because
                  of a tattoo on her buttocks.   David, committing one of the few
                  unselfish acts in the series, bribes a gravedigger to have his
                  mother dug up and interred in a more respectable part of the
                  cemetary.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The third season also demonstrates
                  David being able to move comfortably across racial and religious
                  lines.  In &quot;Krazee-Eyez Killa,&quot; David gets along quite
                  well with the eponymous African-American rapper, even advising
                  him on the placement of &quot;motherfucker&quot; in the lyrics
                  of a work-in-progress.    When Killa bestows the honor on David
                  of calling him &quot;my nigger,&quot; David returns the favor
                  by letting the rapper know that &quot;you are my Caucasian.&quot;
                   In &quot;Mary, Joseph, &amp; Larry,&quot; David performs penance
                  for disrupting the baptism of his sister-in-law's Jewish fianc&eacute;
                  (resulting in the cancellation of the wedding and a heated Jewish-Christian
                  exchange) by hiring a group of Christian actors staging a manger
                  scene to perform at his house during the holidays for his visiting
                  in-laws.   But do not think for a moment that humanity has been
                  restored to the anti-commons.  The bond with the rapper breaks
                  when David, perhaps accidentally, perhaps not, spills the beans
                  to the rapper's fiancee about his infidelities.   And the ecumenical
                  ties with the actors are severed when David comments on the figure
                  of the actress playing Mary, sending Joseph into violent rage
                  against the man of good intentions.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Nonetheless, season three ends
                  optimistically, on a hopeful note for those who think that all
                  is lost in the socially splintered anticommons.  The running
                  plot of the third season concerns David opening a new restaurant
                  with his friends and colleagues.  This transaction, itself, suggests
                  a movement from the Hobbesian world of previous seasons and the
                  emergence of pacifying and sweetening commerce.    In the anticommons,
                  transactions are the main way of building bridges across individuals.
                    But David manages to connect with other people at another level
                  as well.  In the final episode of season three, entitled &quot;The
                  Grand Opening,&quot; David sees a bunch of high school students
                  who have shaved their heads as a sign of solidarity with a classmate
                  undergoing chemotherapy.   David comments, showing for once some
                  depth to his character, that he would like to do something so
                  noble one day.  His time comes on the opening night of the restaurant
                  when his head chef, who suffers from Tourette's Syndrome, breaks
                  out in a bout of loud and unprintable swearing.  The guests stop
                  eating, and David and his partners are paralyzed in their response.
                   Finally, David has his moment, perhaps the key moment of the
                  series, and he covers up for the chef's affliction by swearing
                  very loudly himself.  Soon, everyone in the restaurant begins
                  cursing, David's partner, his father and uncles, his wife's family,
                  and a host of other characters from past episodes.  The denizens
                  of the anticommons engage in their first communal act, transcending
                  their selfish, protectionist tendencies in a profanely shared
                  moment.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So after three seasons perhaps
                  there is hope.  I cannot wait for the fourth season to come out
                  on DVD so I can see if life in the anticommons has evolved any
                  further.   In the meanwhile, I have three DVD sets which have
                  a special place in my library to serve as my portal to a world
                  where social rules and a sense of social solidarity have disintegrated
                  into self-concern, self-aggrandizement, and self-absorption.
                   Hey, they are more entertaining than a faculty meeting or an
                  AALS convention and come with an off button.  <br>
