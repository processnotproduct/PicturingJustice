                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by John Denvir</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Lawyer movies come and go,
                  but some just stick in your mind.<br>
                  <i>True Believer</i> is like that for me. It's not only a good
                  entertainment, but it also raises one of the ultimate questions
                  of legal ethics-how can good lawyers defend bad people?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/truebeliever.jpg" width="150" height="214" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The
                  story revolves around the life choices of criminal defense lawyer
                  Eddie Dodd portrayed in a fine bravura performance by James Woods.
                  The ethical issue is raised by Dodd's neophyte associate, Roger
                  Baron, in a subtle performance by Robert Downey Jr. Baron came
                  to work for Dodd because of Dodd's legendary work as a civil
                  rights attorney, but discovers the Dodd's current practice specializes
                  in the defense of successful narcotics dealers.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Roger is shocked to discover
                  that Dodd is quite successful in exonerating defendants he knows
                  are guilty. He naively asks whether Dodd might someday represent
                  an innocent defendant. His question begins Dodd's search for
                  a moral justification for the role of the criminal defense bar.<br>
<br>
                  Three major justifications are considered in the course of the
                  film. The first represents Baron's amateur perspective: criminal
                  defense attorneys are needed to defend innocent clients. Dodd
                  quickly rejects this utopian premise with the curt reply, &quot;The
                  one thing you learn as a criminal defense lawyer is that they're
                  all guilty.&quot; Of course, we know Dodd exaggerates; every
                  week or so we see a news story abut how new DNA evidence has
                  led to the release of a prisoner unjustly convicted. Still, these
                  cases seem to be the exception, not the rule. Most people charged
                  with crime are guilty of some crime, most the crime with which
                  they are charged.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At the beginning of the film
                  Dodd tries to justify his role by recourse to another well known
                  defense of the criminal defense bar; the noble fight to protect
                  our civil liberties against invasion by a burgeoning police state.
                  The client may be a drug lord, but the true beneficiaries of
                  the lawyer's labors are the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Downey
                  is not impressed with argument; nor am I. Sophisticated lawyers
                  know that the outcome of a case is predicated on two factors,
                  the applicable legal rule and the court's visceral reaction to
                  the factual context in which it is being applied. One partial
                  reason for the judicial shrinking of Fourth and Fifth Amendment
                  is that these lofty constitutional ideals are usually litigated
                  in the context of a nasty drug deal. Of course, zealous advocacy
                  requires a lawyer representing clients accused of drug crimes
                  to use every available defense including those alleging an illegal
                  search and seizure, but to say one takes drug cases in order
                  to promote civil liberties seems a little disingenuous. Our civil
                  liberties have not benefited from their involuntary association
                  with drug dealers.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But Dodd does find good reason
                  to be a true believer in the role of the criminal defense attorney.
                  It comes to him in the person of a Korean mother who asks him
                  to help her son who, serving a life sentence for a gang murder,
                  is now accused of a second murder in a prison gang fight. The
                  viewer already knows her son; the opening shots of the film had
                  shown us him in preparation for the prison fight; we see him
                  having knives taped to both of his hands in order to turn him
                  into some sort of lethal bird of prey. It had never occurred
                  to us that this animal could be somebody's baby boy.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In a mute response to Roger's
                  criticisms, Eddie takes the case. His cynicism dissolves at the
                  sight of this young man whose incarceration has transformed him
                  into a killing machine. He decides that no matter what the boy
                  has done, he's been in prison long enough. It time for a lawyer
                  to go to work.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">From this point on, the film
                  becomes a skillful portrayal of the practice of criminal law.
                  As in real life, investigation of the facts turns out more important
                  than eloquence before a jury. And one gets a good sense of the
                  showmanship necessary to negotiate a good deal for your client
                  And, since movies like to improve on real life, it turns out
                  that Dodd's client is not guilty after all. His first conviction
                  was the product of a police frame-up, and his prison homicide
                  turns out to be a case of self-defense.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But Dodd's response would have
                  been no different if his client has been guilty-and no less heroic.
                  Most Americans only know about the world of crime from the images
                  that appear on movie and televisions screens. Hollywood likes
                  to show us evil geniuses played by the likes of Anthony Hopkins
                  and John Malkovich. These projections of our darkest fantasies
                  work on the dramatic level, but crime on the street is a more
                  prosaic matter. You don't have to jettison the concept of free
                  will to concede that the inhabitants of our prisons are mostly
                  losers who have always been given the wrong end of the social
                  stick from birth. Most criminals are not psychopathic geniuses
                  like Hanibal Lector, but the not so bright sons of broken homes
                  and lousy schools with bleak employment possibilities.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It's true that they have violated
                  a duty to society, but no less true that society had violated
                  its duty to them. At a minimum, we owe them someone to speak
                  up for them in their hour of need. We owe them a good criminal
                  lawyer.</font></p>
