      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Introduction</font></p>
      </b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The
      representation of law and order in the media has long been the subject of
      debate. Most people have little direct contact or experience with the
      criminal justice system and consequently rely on media reports and
      representations of it to supplement their knowledge. A recent addition to
      this debate is television coverage of courtroom proceedings, highlighted
      by disputed media reporting of the OJ Simpson and Louise Woodward trials.
      Trials such as these have led some commentators to suggest justice has
      been reduced to voyeuristic entertainment.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">These
      arguments were revisited when the BBC unsuccessfully argued for television
      and Internet coverage of the Lockerbie trial.<sup>3</sup> However, other
      trials of international significance have embraced audio visual
      technology. The international criminal tribunals concerned with the
      dissolution of the former Yugoslavia (International Criminal Tribunal for
      the former Yugoslavia) and atrocities in Rwanda (International Criminal
      Tribunal for Rwanda) are both televised. I recently completed a report for
      the ICTY on the impact of electronic broadcast coverage of its trials on
      court participants. I will return to this later but it is important first
      to briefly outline the principle contentions surrounding the use of
      cameras in court.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Arguments
      supporting the use of cameras in court</font><p>
      </b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">(i)Don't
      shoot the messenger: television as scrutineer</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Perhaps
      the strongest argument for cameras in court is that television opens up
      the court to public scrutiny. This is often expressed as a logical
      extension of the First Amendment right of the media and arguably may
      reduce the likelihood of judicial impropriety and possible injustices.
      This was posited by the United States Supreme Court in <u>Press-Enterprise
      v Superior Court (1984)</u>:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The
          value of openness lies in the fact that people not actually attending
          trials can have confidence that standards of fairness are being
          observed . . . Openness thus enhances both the basic fairness of the
          criminal trial and the appearance of fairness so essential to public
          confidence in the system.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Public
      confidence in the criminal justice system rests on their perception of it:
      a perception based primarily on media representations. Television cameras,
      it is argued, ensure that justice is<i> seen </i>to be done. Conversely,
      if the camera shows that justice is manifestly not being done this is not
      the fault of the camera but of the justice system itself.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">This
      'don't shoot the messenger' argument was used frequently throughout the
      O.J. Simpson case. Cynthia Glozier, a producer at Court TV, and Greta Van
      Susteren, legal analyst at CNN, both argued that because people were
      uncomfortable with what the camera showed they blamed the camera:
      &quot;All they do is tell what happened in the courtroom. The O.J. Simpson
      case has created sort of a knee-jerk reaction&quot;.</font><sup><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">5</font><p>
      </sup>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The
      premise here is that television does not distort proceedings but simply
      shows them, warts and all. Proponents of televised court cases argue that
      television is a more accurate, purer form of court journalism than the
      printed press. It is the printed press, they argue, that contributes to
      the media circus. The camera allows the public to make up their own minds
      rather than rely on a third-person account of events.</font></p>

      Learning the Law: television as educator</font></p>
      </i>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">If
      televising courtroom proceedings enables the public to examine the legal
      system, it also informs them of its workings. By putting cameras in the
      courtroom, millions of people have the opportunity to understand their
      criminal justice system. Indeed, tapes of actual trials are often and
      increasingly used as teaching tools for law students and attorneys. Court
      TV donates tapes to United States schools and colleges as part of the <i>Cable
      in the Classroom</i> programme.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">(iii)
      Camera shy? Research findings on camera impact</font></p>
      </i>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The
      principal fear about putting cameras in courts is the effect that the
      camera may have on the participants in the trial. Those in favour of
      cameras can point to several studies that show cameras have almost no
      effect on proceedings. Four U.S. jurisdictions have conducted their own
      research into the effects of cameras in their courts. The Judicial
      Conference of the United States stated in its report on cameras in six
      federal district courts and two circuit courts that there had been no
      negative impact on the trial.</font></p>
      <i>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">(iv) O.J.
      not O.K.: Simpson trial an aberration</font></p>
      </i>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">If the
      research findings into the effect of cameras in courts constitute one of
      the strongest arguments for the pro-television lobby, the O.J. Simpson
      trial is probably the weakest. Accusations of attorney 'showboating,'
      excessive trial length and a camera-affected judge have been well
      documented but those supporting televised trials argue that the Simpson
      trial was the exception that proves the rule. In answering criticism of
      the camera coverage of the Simpson trial, many argue it was not the camera
      that created the behaviour of the trial participants. Television, argued
      the editorial in Broadcast &amp; Cable, 'did not control the hemlines on
      Marcia Clark's skirts'.<sup>6</sup> Nor can it be proved that things would
      have been different if the cameras had not been there.</font></p>

      Case law in favour of the courtroom camera</font><p>
      </i>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">There are
      four US cases all decided in the early 1980s, which supporters of cameras
      in court contend back their argument. In 1980 <u>Richmond Newspapers v
      Virginia</u> held that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial was
      afforded not only to defendants, but belonged also to the public. The next
      year <u>Chandler v State of Florida</u> (1981) evaluated the
      constitutionality of revised Canon 3A(7) of the Florida Code of Judicial
      Conduct which permitted electronic media coverage of judicial courts. It
      ruled that the presence of a camera in court did not inherently deprive a
      criminal defendant of a fair trial. In <u>Globe Newspaper Co. v Superior
      Court</u> (1982) it was held that a Massachusettes law prohibiting access
      to trials involving sexual offences on a minor violated the First
      Amendment. It ruled that the state must show compelling government
      interest to exclude the public and press from a trial. Later in <u>People
      v Spring</u> (1984) the court ruled that the presence of a television
      camera during a trial did not violate the criminal's sixth Amendment right
      to a fair trial.</font></p>

      Heeeeeeeeere's justice: soundbites and sensationalism</font></p>
      </i>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Many
      arguments in favour of cameras in the court are based on the assumption
      that the public watches what has been termed 'gavel to gavel' broadcasts
      of trials, that is to say unabridged airings of court proceedings. It is
      this coverage that educates the people and opens the court up for public
      examination. Opponents point out that the practical reality of television
      audiences is rather different. They submit that the public tends to watch
      the edited highlights of a case, which potentially misrepresent the facts.
      It was precisely this fear that led the United States Judicial Conference
      to end the three-year experiment of cameras in six federal state courts in
      1994. This decision was taken despite the Federal Judicial Centre
      concluding that no trial during the three years had been adversely
      affected. Several judges who sat on the Conference stated they would
      reconsider their decision if proceedings were broadcast gavel to gavel.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Critics
      of televised trials propose it is what television does with the trial
      footage that is potentially so damaging. The story presented to judge and
      jury is presented over the course of the trial. In contrast, television
      news stories will focus on what is most interesting to the audience rather
      than what is most important to the proceedings. Reporters may use, for
      example, footage of a defendant in tears and join film with their own
      storyline. This could create a narrative that may differ from the central
      issue of the case.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">It is not
      only television's potential to prejudice cases that concerns commentators,
      but also the use of harrowing and disturbing trials as entertainment.
      Televised trials are simply 'voyeurism tarted up in rights talk'.<sup>7</sup>
      Television, they submit, is there to entertain and this will necessitate
      converting hours of legal argument and technicality into compulsive
      viewing. As West comments:</font></p>

      </i>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Associated
      with criticism of televised trials as sensational is the accusation that
      cameras diminish the court's dignity. This argument was used in the
      Supreme Court of Mississippi where cameras were excluded from the Byron de
      la Beckwith murder trial in 1995 and the Susan Smith murder trial in July
      of the same year. Also, in 1995 Superior Court Judge Lawrence Antolini
      restricted coverage to the first five minutes of each court day in the
      Polly Klaas murder trial. The potential for cameras to interfere with the
      decorum of judicial proceedings has led several U.S. judges to speak out
      on the matter, including Judge William L Howard:</font></p>

        Starstruck: cameras pervert the trial process</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Despite
      research to the contrary, opponents of television in court maintain that
      the presence of cameras affects participants. This is argued on two
      fronts. First, it is contended that existing research, which concludes
      that trial participants suffer no adverse effects from cameras in court,
      is methodologically flawed. Lassiter critiques the individual state
      research (discussed above) and argues that the samples used in the studies
      were too small. The Nevada study only surveyed thirty-one respondents,
      while Virginia and California relied on less than 60. He also suggests
      that the self-reporting techniques adopted in all the surveys created a
      bias in the results. The second line of argument is based on research
      which suggests that cameras do affect those in the court. In 1991 the New
      York Bar Association reported that cameras do have a prejudicial impact.<sup>10</sup>
      Among the findings, 35% of attorneys said that the atmosphere was uneasy
      as a result of cameras, 56% of defence attorneys reported that they felt
      the fairness of the trial was affected by cameras and 19% of witnesses
      admitted to being distracted.</font></p>

      recording and broadcasting Tribunal proceedings and the nature and quality
      of such television coverage; the effect, if any, of the use of cameras on
      the administration of justice and decorum of proceedings in the Tribunal's

      adopt the Tribunal's audio visual policy in its courtrooms. Space
      precludes a discussion of all of these areas; what follows is a discussion
      of the impact of cameras on court participants and the role of electronic

      of Cameras on Court Participants</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">One
      of the most important elements of the study of electronic broadcast
      coverage of court proceedings at the ICTY was to ascertain what impact, if
      any, the presence of cameras had on proceedings. Respondents were asked
      whether they thought televising proceedings affected the behaviour in
      court of themselves, witnesses, judges, counsel and defendants.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The
      overwhelming majority of respondents (92%) stated they were only 'occasionally' or
      'rarely aware' of the cameras in the courtroom. It
      is interesting to note, however, that no respondent claimed to be totally
      unaware of their presence either. Judges were the most aware of cameras in
      the court; 16% stated they were 'very aware' and 67% reported being 'occasionally
      aware'.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The
      primary reason given by those who stated that the presence of cameras did
      not affect them in the trial chamber was concentration on the case itself.
      On a practical level, respondents described the cameras as Adiscreet@,
      Aunobtrusive@ and Ahidden@. Many respondents explained that they simply
      forgot that cameras were present in the courtroom:</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">When
      asked about the effect of cameras on witness behaviour, the majority of
      respondents (55%) thought it was possible that witnesses were affected. A
      significant proportion (20%), however, did state that in their view,
      witness testimony is affected in some way by cameras, while a quarter of
      respondents thought the reverse.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The
      uncertainty surrounding witness' behaviour in court centred on the nature
      of the Tribunal itself. It was argued by many respondents that the nature
      of cross examination and the consequent pressure on a witness during a
      trial made testimony an exacting task. Determining the effect that a
      camera has on a witness was therefore difficult.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">In
      discussing the insignificance of cameras on witnesses, some respondents
      remarked on the painful nature of testimony. Not simply the pressure of
      giving evidence at the Tribunal but the content itself:</font></p>

        <blockquote>

          emotional dimension of talking about how their whole family was
          massacred and resurrecting these painful experiences - they are not
          playing to the cameras. They're not thinking about the cameras.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Very few
      respondents stated that cameras in the court affected judges (4%). It was
      felt by respondents that judges, more than any other group, were the least
      likely to alter their behaviour in court in front of cameras. Respondents
      who suggested judges were largely unaffected by cameras in the courtroom
      gave two primary reasons: professionalism and familiarity. Respondents
      proposed that judges were experienced, highly competent people who could
      focus on the job in hand. Secondly, by sitting in court daily, judges
      became accustomed to the technology in the courtroom, including cameras.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Compared
      with other court participants, respondents saw counsel as more likely to
      be affected by cameras in the Tribunal's courtrooms. 80% thought counsel
      were either affected or possibly affected, although the majority reported
      the latter. Where judges were more unsure of the camera's effect on their
      own behaviour, most counsel (75%) reported not being affected. Perhaps
      significantly, 25% of counsel themselves and 33% of judges reported that
      cameras in court affected their behaviour.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The main

      potential impact and contribution of the ICTY's audio visual policy to
      other international trials is significant. Many ICTY staff argued that
      cameras should be encouraged in the administration of international
      justice. There were two predominant reasons offered. First, to recount to
      the international community the workings of the court. Echoing the reasons
      given by respondents for the use of cameras at the ICTY, a large
      proportion of those interviewed stated that cameras at other international
      trials would enable worldwide circulation of the international judicial
      process. In essence, cameras enable justice to be seen to be doneBallowing
      the international community the opportunity to scrutinise the due process
      of international justice. It would further address the problem of
      geographical location of a trial. The camera can create a global public
      gallery.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Secondly,
      respondents argued that cameras enabled endorsement and approval from the

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Consequent
      to discussions about the use of cameras in international trials,
      respondents who contended that the Lockerbie trial should be televised
      pointed out the importance of the trial within the international
      community. Electronic broadcast coverage of the trial, it was argued,
      would show justice being administered. Respondents also discussed the
      political nature of the trial and whether cameras would, in any sense,
      politicise the courtroom. There was some consensus concerning the minimal
      impact cameras would make to the politics of the Lockerbie trial:</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">I don't think the coverage politicises the courtroom. The case may have
          political components in it, but that's up to the judges and the
          participants to make sure it doesn't become a political exercise
          rather than a legal and judicial one. But every case has the potential
          to have a political leaning - that's inevitable.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Indeed,
      it was suggested that the use of audio-visual coverage may have a positive
      effect on the political nature of the trial:</font></p>

          misinformation, mis-reporting, a lot of political bias - go for the
          publicity....if you have no publicity every defence lawyer will go on
          the streets every evening saying Awell today the prosecutor lied to
          the court, he manipulated the evidence, he planted false evidence@ Do
          you want this? I don't see what interest it is going to serve. I would

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">As
      discussed above, the question whether electronic broadcast equipment
      should be used in the Lockerbie trial has been raised by the BBC in
      Scotland. After several appeals, the court found against the BBC, stating
      the right to a fair trial should be protected. The court argued that the
      use of cameras in the Lockerbie trial could <i>inter alia </i>discourage
      witnesses from coming forward and thus 'prejudice the interests of justice'.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Respondents
      at the ICTY, however, have argued that cameras do not prejudice the
      interests of justice nor affect the impartiality of the court. 92% of
      respondents stated that cameras did not affect the administration of
      justice, 46% of whom argued cameras had a positive effect. The divergence
      in opinion between the Scottish judiciary and court staff at the ICTY may
      perhaps be explained by public perception. Given the importance of justice
      being seen to be done in the Lockerbie trial, the use of electronic
      broadcast equipment, with all its Simpson trial baggage, may have given
      the public perception of the exact opposite.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Conclusion</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Electronic
      broadcast coverage of court proceedings is likely to gain further
      political significance in the United Kingdom following the recent
      enactment of the <u>Human Rights Act</u> 1999. The Act incorporates the
      European Convention on Human Rights into U.K. domestic law. Article 6
      states that 'everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a
      reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by
      law'. The article additionally states that the press may be excluded in
      the interests of 'morals, public order or national security' or where 'the protection of the private life of the parties so
      require'. It also
      expounds that where 'publicity would prejudice the interests of justice' the judge may also exclude the press and public.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Irrespective
      of the technological developments that may occur, it is undeniable that
      electronic broadcast coverage of court proceedings will eventually change
      the British justice system permanently. It is therefore imperative that
      further and more detailed examination of this contentious issue is
      undertaken in both political and academic arenas.</font></p>
