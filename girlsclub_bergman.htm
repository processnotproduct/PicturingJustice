                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Paul Bergman</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/girlsclub.jpg" width="126" height="217" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">It
                  is all too tempting to trash the images of lawyers and law firms
                  portrayed in the first ever episode of David Kelley's newest
                  show, <i>Girls' Club</i>. After all, one partner sexually harasses
                  his prot&eacute;g&eacute; (Girl # 1) and forces her to pressure
                  an opposing attorney into making a settlement offer on a legally
                  invalid claim that seems to have been chosen mainly for its ability
                  to titillate the audience with the image of a doctor fainting
                  into a woman's crotch. A second partner allows another young
                  associate (Girl # 2) to practice her litigation skills for the
                  first time by representing a sexual deviant charged with capital
                  murder. The partner sits and watches while the D.A. tricks the
                  associate into asking the judge to declare a mistrial, thus giving
                  the D.A. a chance to retry a case that has been going badly.
                  A third partner so terrifies and humiliates a third associate
                  (Girl # 3) that the latter calls a smug, supercilious colleague
                  a &quot;dyke,&quot; nearly ending Girl # 3's employment with
                  the firm even before the show gets cancelled. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Despite this parade of utter
                  nonsense I want to say something nice about this first episode
                  of <i>The Girls Club</i> because I found it somewhat enjoyable.
                  And what I can say is this: the show's storylines are comedic
                  representations of how it might feel to be a young associate
                  in a big law firm. For example, like many young associates, The
                  Girls think that going to trial is the Holy Grail of law practice.
                  Thus, Girls 1 and 3 sigh enviously when they cross examine Girl
                  # 2 until she admits that trying the capital murder case is a
                  huge emotional rush. Moreover, just like many young associates,
                  all the girls think that the partners are out to make life miserable
                  for them. Many young associates feel that law school has left
                  them ill equipped to carry out law firm tasks, and live in constant
                  fear that partners will tear their work apart. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So the way to watch <i>The
                  Girls' Club</i> is to look at it through the eyes of the protagonists
                  and have fun. Nothing you will see is real; all of it represents
                  the angst that many new lawyers feel when they begin to practice
                  law in big law <br>
