                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by John Wendt</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Scratch almost any Bob Hope
                  film and you will find a legal issue. Most of the time, especially
                  in the &quot;Road Films&quot; you can find Bob and Bing Crosby
                  in the midst of a scam and on the lam.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/hope1.jpg" width="206" height="155" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">On
                  the occasion of his 100th birthday and now subsequent passing,
                  I would like to thank Bob Hope for a film that is often overlooked
                  but is chock full of legal concepts, <i>Son of Paleface</i>.
                  The 1952 Paramount classic, directed by Frank Tashlin and with
                  a screenplay by Frank Tashlin, Robert Welch and Joseph Quillan,
                  is the sequel to another Hope classic, <i>The Paleface</i>.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In <i>The Paleface</i> Hope
                  plays &quot;Painless&quot; Peter Potter, a dentist from out East
                  in a Wild West spoof co-starring Jane Russell as Calamity Jane.
                  The 1948 movie was Bob Hope's first color film and a huge box
                  office success winning the Academy Award for Best Song with &quot;<i>Buttons
                  and Bows</i>.&quot; Now comes <i>Son of Paleface</i> where Junior,
                  a recent Harvard graduate and eastern tenderfoot heads to the
                  Wild West to claim the inheritance left by his daddy, &quot;Paleface&quot;
                  Potter.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So often films with legal concepts
                  are dramas - <i>Twelve Angry Men</i>, <i>The Firm, A Man for
                  All Seasons.</i> Or if there is a comedy it still focuses on
                  a courtroom or law school- <i>My Cousin Vinny, Adam's Rib</i>
                  or <i>Legally Blonde</i>. Here the legal concepts are almost
                  hidden in the film and that's the beauty of it. They come so
                  fast and furiously that you often don't see them but they are
                  there, including: robbery, criminal law, federalism, wills, creditors
                  remedies, community property, bribery, negligence, product liability,
                  consumer protection, fraud and even animal rights and conjugal
                  visits for prisoners. And in true Hope fashion, the jokes come
                  so quickly that you can easily miss many of them. And some of
                  the jokes are so bad, so corny, and at times, so obnoxious, that
                  they are good.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At the beginning of the film
                  California is being hit by a non-stop series of stagecoach hold-ups
                  by &quot;The Torch&quot; (Jane Russell). Despite increasing rewards,
                  there is no luck and Governor Freeman asks for Federal Aid. Coming
                  to the rescue in better than Indiana Jones fashion, are Federal
                  Agents, Roy Barton (played by Roy Rogers), Doc Lovejoy (played
                  by Lloyd Corrigan) and, of course, Roy's horse, Trigger, &quot;The
                  Smartest Horse in the Movies.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">They soon figure out that the
                  town of Sawbuck Pass is The Torch's headquarters.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Governor Freeman: &quot;Be
                  careful, Roy. If The Torch ever finds out that you and Doc are
                  Federal Agents, you'll never get out alive.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Roy: &quot;We have before.
                  You see, Governor, I disguise myself with a song and Doc hides
                  behind a bottle of patent medicine.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In Sawbuck Pass, Roy, the singing
                  cowboy, preps the crowd for Doc's pitch of the sure to be FDA
                  approved patent medicine.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Doc (from his peddler's wagon):
                  &quot;And now, Ladies and Gentlemen, my partner and his four-legged
                  friend have told you a few, only a few, of the curative powers
                  of Doc Lovejoy's Wonder Tonic. Now, who's going to be the first
                  one to waltz up and purchase a clean bill of health?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Also under cover is The Torch's
                  chief henchman, Kirk (Bill Williams)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kirk: &quot;Hey, Doc. I'd like
                  to buy a bottle for the sheriff. He's suffering from 'Torch Trouble.'&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sheriff: &quot;That ain't funny,
                  mister.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kirk: &quot;Ain't funny having
                  bandits steal our gold. Getting so nobody's safe. The next thing
                  you know The Torch will be riding in, shooting up the town.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Enter Junior Potter fresh from
                  Harvard in his new horseless carriage, emitting smoke and backfiring
                  like gunshots.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior (in the midst of the
                  smoke): &quot;Somebody must be smoking a full pack. (As the smoke
                  clears to reveal him and his horseless carriage in full Harvard
                  regalia) &quot;Easy folks, it's only me. Only me! That's the
                  understatement of the year!&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">With reckless driving he creates
                  havoc in the streets and spews mud all over town and its inhabitants.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;Out of my way!
                  I'm a Harvard Man!&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The steering wheel comes off
                  and he literally runs into and knocks over Roy and Doc's wagon
                  causing damage and sending Doc, Roy and Trigger into the mud.
                  Junior is upset because the wagon ran into him!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;A scratch&#133;Look
                  a scratch on my mudguard. Sheriff&#133; Where's the Sheriff?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sheriff: &quot;I'm the Sheriff.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;Oh, you the man?
                  Well, Sheriff, run down to the corner and get me a crooked lawyer.
                  How do you like that? Look at the fellow rolling in the mud.
                  Arrest him for drunk driving. I'm an innocent man and if you
                  have any justice in you, you'll accept my bribe.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Roy: &quot;What's the big idea?
                  Look what you did to our wagon, my horse!&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior (looking at Trigger):
                  &quot;Quarantine that beast. He's got chicken pox.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Roy (grabbing Junior): Listen
                  you.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;Please, lips
                  that touch liquor shall never touch mine.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Roy: &quot;I never touched
                  a drop in my life.&quot; (A great reference to Roy Roger's famous
                  temperance position.)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;Then somebody's
                  been putting bourbon in your toothpaste.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Roy: &quot;Why you&#133;&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sheriff: &quot;Just a minute.
                  Now you'll pay for that wagon, stranger, or you'll go to the
                  hoosgow.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;The 'whogow?'
                  Oh, the 'hoosgow.' Hold on, you can't put a Harvard man in jail!
                  It's unsanitary!&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Roy: &quot;What are you going
                  to pay for that wagon with?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;A preposition
                  at the end of a sentence and you split your infinitives. Next
                  thing you know he'll be dangling his participles. Oh, oh, shame
                  on you, the school marm will certainly here about this, sir.
                  Now, can one of you peasants direct me to the bank? I'm here
                  to claim the inheritance left by my daddy, Paleface Potter.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Voice from the crowd: &quot;You
                  Paleface's son?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;You're staring
                  right at him&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The crowd, in fact the entire
                  town gathers at the bank. At the Bank, Mr. Stoner (Harry Von
                  Zell) reads the will to Junior.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Mr. Stoner: &quot;'The reason
                  I leave my money to my son, Junior, is that being of sound mind'
                  - Well, I won't bother to read the last paragraph, Junior. It's
                  merely an expression of your father's love for you, his son.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;Oh, just a minute,
                  just a minute. I was so young at the time I don't remember many
                  of the things Daddy said about me. He poured out his heart in
                  this will. I'd kind of like to read it.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/hope2.jpg" width="186" height="140" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Junior:
                  &quot;'The reason I leave my money to my son, Junior, is that
                  being of sound mind I can't leave my money to my wife cause I
                  ain't never forgiven her since the day she presented me an idiot
                  for a son&#133;.' I was the only child. 'But this idiot is all
                  I've got in the world, which shows what a lousy spot I'm in&#133;.'
                  All Dad's friends like me! What a reception! All those smiling
                  faces out there.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Mr. Stoner: &quot;Some of those
                  faces out there aren't smiling, Junior. You see your father left
                  town in a hurry. He left a lot of bills to a lot of people. They
                  expect to be paid out of the money you inherit.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior and Mr. Stoner go to
                  the back room so that Junior can open his daddy's chest and claim
                  his immense inheritance.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Mr. Stoner: &quot;There's your
                  father's chest, Junior. Hasn't been moved since he put it there.
                  Here's the key.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;It's a Yale lock.
                  I wish I had my gloves.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Meanwhile Mr. Stoner and his
                  assistant, Waverly, move to the front office to give Junior some
                  privacy to open the literal treasure chest.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Mr. Stoner (to Waverly): &quot;If
                  they hang Junior Potter they should be ashamed of themselves.
                  For his sake I hope he finds a lot of money.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Waverly: &quot;The way that
                  mob's attacking he'll need it.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Mr. Stoner: &quot;Look at that
                  big fellow with the block and tackle. They'll tear him limb from
                  limb. Oh!!!!!!!!&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Waverly: &quot;This whole thing
                  makes me sick to my stomach.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Mr. Stoner: &quot;Well, Junior
                  will be worse than sick to his stomach if doesn't bring that
                  gold out here. You hold him off while I go get him.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the meantime Junior opens
                  his father's treasure chest, only to find&#133;&#133;&#133; nothing!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Feigning &quot;gold fever&quot;
                  he buys some time. According to the will he's got two days to

                  Delroy (Jane Russell) the gorgeous showgirl who owns the Dirty
                  Shame Saloon (when she's not robbing stagecoaches) and he's off
                  to romance her.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;What's your name,
                  honey?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Mike: &quot;My friends call
                  me 'Mike.'&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;Pretty masculine
                  handle for such a feminine pot of goodies. Mind if I take pot
                  luck?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As he goes to get his horseless
                  carriage to take Mike on a date, his daddy's former partner,
                  Ebenezer Hawkins (Paul E. Burns) tells him to concentrate on
                  the riddle that Paleface left him to find the gold rather than
                  taking Mike out on a date.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Eb: &quot;You've got not time
                  for romance, boy! You've got to think!&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;I've been doing
                  plenty of thinking. I didn't go to college fourteen years for
                  nothing! I've got it all figured out. It just so happens the
                  richest girl in town is crazy about me.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Eb: &quot;You mean Mike?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;Ha hah. By tomorrow
                  she'll be Mrs. Mike Potter. Don't you get it? I marry her. This
                  is California. Community property. I divide her money. With my
                  half I'll pay my stingy old Daddy's bills. The rest is gravy.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Eb: &quot;But, we'll have that
                  woman on our hands!&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;Please, keep
                  your hands out of my gravy.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">And the race is on to find
                  the gold and pay off the creditors at the same time.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The rest of the movie only
                  gets better. In the end, Bob, for once, gets the girl, the creditors
                  get paid and Roy and Trigger ride off into the sunset!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">And all agree that Son of Paleface
                  is one of the few sequels that may be even better than the original.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It's definitely worth your
                  time and effort to find and watch both films and realize what
                  a treasure we had in Bob Hope.<br>
                  </font></p>
