<br>
                  Reality court shows have been around since the mid 1980s when
                  Judge Joseph A. Wapner, a retired member of the Los Angeles County
                  bench, handled small claims cases, on <i>The People's Court</i>.
                  Although not a ratings smash, <i>The People's Court</i> was successful
                  enough, and in a classic example fiction merging with legal reality,
                  Judge &quot;Wapner became America's most famous jurist better
                  known, said the polls, than United States Supreme Court Chief
                  Justice William H. Rehnquist.&quot; Almost twenty years later,
                  television reality court shows have replaced soap operas as the
                  top daytime viewing genre. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/judgejoebrown.jpg" width="127" height="127" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">On shows like <i>The
                  People's Court</i> the &quot;judge&quot; is the center of attention
                  due in part to the absence of lawyers. While the absence of lawyers
                  is not unusual in pro se courts, Divorce Court suggests pro se
                  representation also is the norm in family court. Thus, viewers
                  like Anthony Widgeon mistakenly think they know how the family
                  court system works from watching <i>Judge Judy</i> and <i>Judge
                  Joe Brown</i>, the two most popular daytime court reality television
                  programs on commercial television. Instead, when Mr. Widgeon
                  appeared in circuit court on a domestic matter without legal
                  representation, he quickly ended up in jail. He mistakenly thought
                  he could delay his case by making a motion for a continuance.
<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/judgejudy.jpg" width="109" height="138" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Real court, however, is not like
                  <i>Judge Judy</i>. Daytime reality television court shows are
                  real fake courts involving minor, even petty matters. Ads for
                  some shows tout them as offering the viewers real judges, real
                  disputes and real justice. What the promotions for these shows
                  do not clearly disclose is that what we are seeing is a distorted
                  form of arbitration portrayed as a real trial. In truth, television
                  syndicators hire the &quot;judges&quot; most, but not all, of
                  whom are former real-life judges, seeks out and pays litigants
                  to present their case before television cameras in courtroom
                  settings constructed by producers.<br>
<br>
                  Despite their entertainment value, the impact of reality court
                  shows on viewer's perceptions of the legal system cannot be over
                  estimated. Two social scientists writing in 1988 about litigant's
                  expectations of the civil justice systems were struck by litigants'
                  repeated references in small claims court to <i>The People's
                  Court</i>. They wrote &quot;we now suspect that the television
                  program is a significant factor in many litigants' decisions
                  to go to small claims courts and an important influence on the
                  way they prepare their <br>
                  cases.&quot; These studies fail to address whether contemporary
                  reality court shows' educational function is overshadowed by
                  what some argue is a gross distortion of the judicial system,
                  an important American institution. Also unclear is whether these
                  court shows reflect reality, or create a false realty so powerful
                  that it overshadows conventional public perceptions about the
                  actual civil court system in America.<br>
<br>
                  For more than forty years, television has been a window to our
                  world, shaping our image of local and world events. Today approximately
                  100 million American homes have television sets. In 1995 it was
                  estimated that collectively, Americans watch over 120 billion
                  hours of television each year. Television is a primary news source
                  for most Americans, and &quot;an almost constant companion of
                  many.&quot; Studies of television viewing audiences find that
                  women, especially women over 50, watch more television than men;
                  blacks watch more television than whites; and less educated and
                  less affluent Americans watch more television than more educated
                  and more affluent Americans. <br>
<br>
                  Given the pervasiveness of television, its power to affect and
                  define how the viewing audience perceives the legitimacy of public
                  and private institutions of power is great. The resulting public
                  perceptions about institutions like the court may affect whether
                  the institutional failings are corrected. One clear distortion
                  of the American judicial system present in the TV reality court
                  shows is the representation of judges. <br>
<br>
                  During the 2000-2001 television season there were nine reality
                  court shows in syndication, <i>The People's Court, Judge Judy,
                  Judge Joe Brown, Divorce Court, Judge Hatchett, Judge Greg Mathis,
                  Curtis Court, Judge Mills Lane, and Moral Court</i>.<br>
<br>
                  Six of the nine judges were male, two were white, and four were
                  black. Three judges were women, one white woman, Judge Judy and
                  two black women, Judge Hatchett, and Mablean Ephraim on Divorce
                  Court. When the 2001-2002 television season began, there were
                  eight daytime court shows, and none of the judges were white
                  males. In January 2002 Larry Joe Doherty, a white male, aired
                  on a new show entitled Texas Justice. When the 2002-2003 season
                  began seven shows remained with three male and four female judges.
                  The fourth woman was Judge Marilyn Milian, a Cuban American,
                  who took over <i>The People's Court</i>. Of the seven current
                  television judges, only Judge Doherty is white and male. <br>
<br>
                  In real life, however, most judges are white and male. Only 3.3%
                  of all judges in the United States are black, and the percentages
                  are even lower for Latinas/os and Asian Americans. Women comprise
                  only 7% are of all federal judges and 9% of all state judges.
                  The percentage of black women judges is even lower than the percentages
                  for blacks and women generally. Thus, it is surprising that two
                  black women, one Cuban American woman, one white woman, two black
                  men and only one white man preside over the seven reality court
                  television shows that air daily in most major cities. <br>
<br>
                  Perhaps the overrepresentation of women, blacks and black males
                  on TV reality court shows simply reflects network attempts to
                  reach targeted viewing audiences. Yet this over representation
                  is not only a distortion of actual judicial demographics in the
                  United States, it also is a distortion of demographic make-up
                  of the television population generally. A recent survey of the
                  small screen by Children Now found that only 17% of the prime
                  time television population is black; 75% of the prime time television
                  population is white. Women account for only a third of prime
                  time television characters. <br>
                  The Children Now study concedes that increasingly women are portrayed
                  on television as professionals like lawyers and doctors, and
                  whites and blacks &quot;appear with about equal frequency as
                  physicians, attorneys and in service/retail/restaurants jobs.&quot;
                  Thus, television creates the impression that women and non-whites,
                  primarily black male lawyers, are well represented in the legal
                  community.<br>
<br>
                  Whatever the reasons, the over representation of women and non-white
                  judges on reality court shows, coupled with the perceived over
                  representation of black judges on television in general, is problematic
                  in the highly racialized society in which we live. The over representation
                  of women and black male judges on television not only sends an
                  erroneous message about the extent of their representation in
                  the judiciary, but may actually undermine popular support for
                  increased racial and gender diversity on the bench by suggesting
                  that our nation's benches are already diverse, or that blacks
                  and/or women have taken over the courts.<br>
<br>
                  Arguably, the overrepresentation of women and black men on daytime
                  reality court shows creates a &quot;'synthetic experience,' a
                  substitute for reality that feels real.&quot; Leonard Steinhorn
                  and Barbara Diggs-Brown argue in their book, BY THE COLOR OF
                  OUR SKIN: THE ILLUSION OF INTEGRATION AND THE REALITY OF RACE,
                  that &quot;the average white American family. . . . see[s] more
                  blacks beamed into their living room on a typical evening than
                  they have seen at any other time or place during the day. . .
                  . creating the impression that the world is more integrated than
                  it truly is.&quot; They call this phenomenon virtual integration.
                  Thus, it is conceivable that the composition of daytime reality
                  court shows misleads viewers about the racial and gender composition
                  of real judges.<br>
<br>
                  On television the court room is integrated. On the shows the
                  race of the bailiff is always different from the race of the
                  judge. Also male judges tend to have female bailiffs and female
                  judges tend to have male bailiffs. Since all the shows share
                  this feature, clearly race and gender are factors considered
                  by snydicators. Perhaps syndicators realize that integrated courtrooms
                  with women and black judges appeal to television audiences. The
                  presence of women and non-white judges in integrated settings
                  reassure viewers that justice in the United States is meted out
                  impartially. While there are positive aspects to this portrayal
                  of the courts, there are negative aspects as well.<br>
<br>
                  One political scientist speculates that white's misperceptions
                  about blacks' standing in American society make be the result
                  of the success of some blacks. &quot;As the black middle class
                  swells, more whites see blacks who have the same skills, earn
                  the same money, and live in the same kinds of neighborhoods,&quot;
                  and the increased sense of competition these observations engender
                  in white Americans. It is no surprise that whites with the greatest
                  misperceptions about the socio-economic status of blacks are
                  less educated and affluent. Since less affluent and educated
                  viewers are some of the same people who watch more daytime television,
                  the possibility of the distorted information about the gender
                  and racial composition of the judiciary is increased. <br>
<br>
                  When virtual integration actually occurs, it easy for this group
                  of whites viewers to doubt claims of the under representation
                  of women and non-whites in the judiciary and the need for American
                  society to make meaningful steps to address this problem. The
                  fantasy of a racially integrated society keeps many whites from
                  confronting how little contact they have with non-whites, especially
                  black Americans, in real life. Given these concerns, reality
                  television court shows bear closer examination.<br>
<br>
                  Overall, the women judges, especially Judge Judy, the prototype
                  for the new daytime reality court shows, come off as shrill.
                  Judge Mablean Ephraim is an especially discomforting television
                  image with her harsh sermons, mammy-like physique and gestures.
                  Glenda Hatchett, initially more reserved during her first season,
                  has become increasingly shrill as her show lags behind <i>Judge
                  Judy, Judge Joe Brown and Divorce Court</i> in the ratings. <br>
<br>
                  A brief comparison of <i>The People's Court</i> and <i>Judge
                  Judy</i> with <i>Divorce Court</i> and <i>Judge Hatchett</i>
                  suggests that the two black women judges, in varying degrees
                  go beyond the legal framework of the law to help litigants resolve
                  their problems. The willingness of judges to openly go beyond
                  the law can be seen by the viewing audience as either a positive
                  or negative attribute. Viewers who do not have much faith in
                  the American judicial system might feel more positively about
                  using the system to resolve grievances. <br>
<br>
                  On the other hand, other viewers may conclude, especially when
                  comparing <i>Divorce Court</i> and <i>Judge Hatchett</i> with
                  <i>The People's Court</i> and <i>Judge Judy</i>, that black women
                  judges, like the black jurors in the O.J. Simpson case, routinely
                  nullify or disregard the law. As a result, these viewers may
                  be less inclined to support the election or appointment of black
                  women judges in real life. It is simply too early to know whether
                  this suspicion is true or false, but the impact of these two
                  shows on viewer perceptions about the courts and judges bears
                  watching. <br>
<br>
                  Even if one concludes that the over representation of women and
                  non-white male judges on reality court shows distorts the civil
                  justice system, there is no clear linkage between over representation
                  on television, and under representation in real court rooms across
                  the nation. The long-term impact, if any, is something to be
                  monitored. Nevertheless, one should not under estimate the power
                  of virtual integration in shaping public perceptions. <br>
