                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This question is put to the
                  lawyer protagonist, Frank Galvin (Paul Newman), by the bereaved,
                  and now enraged, son of a deceased accident victim, after Galvin,
                  posing as the father's friend, slips his card into his widowed
                  mother's hands in a funeral home, one of several at which Galvin
                  attends to drum up contingency fee arrangements. And it is repeated,
                  later on in the piece, by the no less enraged brother-in-law
                  of the client, the vegetative Deborah Ann Kay, whose case-- Galvin's
                  only case (&quot;there are no other cases, this is the case&quot;)--
                  provides the narrative structure of this wonderfully written
                  (David Mamet) and executed (Sidney Lumet) 1982 film.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/verdict.jpg" width="153" height="210" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Francis
                  P. Galvin: second in his Boston College class of '52, law review
                  editor, twelve years of distinguished criminal law and personal
                  injury practice in a two-man firm, married the beautiful Patricia
                  Harrington (her smiling photo remains still at Frank's bedside)
                  and, with that and without more, found himself a full partner
                  in her daddy's prestigious law firm, Sterns, Harrington &amp;
                  Pierce; after nine years fired from the firm under a cloud of
                  manufactured allegations of jury tampering (&quot;accused, never
                  indicted&quot; as one character puts it, nor notably ever disciplined);
                  now dumped and divorced, he has in the three-and-a- half years
                  since descended into a hellish caricature of the middle-aged,
                  alcoholic, obit-reading, ambulance-chasing, case-starved (&quot;four
                  cases in the last three years, he's lost them all&quot;) sole
                  practitioner. It falls to this Frank -- Frankie to his friends
                  and acquaintances, lawyers and fellow boozers alike -- to deliver
                  an answer, his verdict, on just that question: who indeed is
                  he? and does his being a lawyer matter to that determination?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Galvin's journey of self-interrogation,
                  discovery, and affirmation, as a lawyer, is complex. It is punctuated
                  throughout by pauses, by silences, some brief, others lengthy,
                  each a gnawing and revelatory insistence that Galvin confront
                  and engage, not just his circumstance, but his very self; it
                  is framed at beginning and end by the ringing -- a calling surely
                  -- of bells. And it takes shape through the medium of his client's
                  medical negligence case, in the fellowship Galvin undeservedly
                  enjoys with his mentor and original partner, the now semi-retired
                  Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden) and, centrally, through his relationship
                  with the female presence Laura Fisher (Charlotte Rampling), whose
                  unexpected appearance in his life leads Galvin, until very near
                  the end, to believe his redemption resides in the recuperation
                  of his personal life. But Galvin's destination turns out to be
                  much more interesting and instructive than that, so far at least
                  as it concerns the demands and promises of leading a life at
                  the law.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">We know straightaway that something
                  is afoot in Galvin's life. The film opens, the credits still
                  before us, with the ringing of bells. Galvin appears playing
                  a pinball machine in what we know is his favorite bar, his home
                  away from the dingy apartment to which he repairs to sleep it
                  off. Play he does and drink he does: but he also disengages from
                  both, before the film speaks a word, once, then again and again,
                  in a silence and stare at once perplexed and searching. There
                  follows, in the film's first several scenes, the same silence:
                  after he is ushered out of a funeral home; at the bar in early
                  morning, hands shaking so badly he must take his first sip, head
                  bowed, sucking the whisky directly from the shot glass; at the
                  bar one evening after performing his best brogue for the lads,
                  after buying them all a round; the morning after his drunken
                  destruction of his office, of his framed credentials, his call
                  included, after Mickey dresses him down (&quot;Frankie, listen
                  to me because I'm done fucking with you. I can't take this any
                  more. I mean you're not going to change.&quot;); during his meeting
                  with his client's sister, Sally Donneghy, after ignoring the
                  file for eighteen months, trial impending, his eyes fixed on
                  the photos of a healthy Deborah Ann.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Thus does Frankie confront,
                  interrogate, himself -- in silence, within, not a word spoken
                  to any other. Perhaps for this reason, he at first misrecognizes
                  himself and misappraises what his redemption requires of him.
                  Even after what he experiences as an epiphany in the life-deserted
                  presence of his client -- again in silent stare, he experiences
                  her for the first time as a site of responsibility and no longer
                  as a source of contingency fee income, after he painfully, finally,
                  declares to a passing nurse, &quot;I am her attorney&quot; --
                  he thinks his fate a matter of his deciding simply to change,
                  to lead a renewed life. And so he acts and declares. He declines,
                  without client authorization, from the Bishop of Boston no less,
                  in whose &quot;renowned&quot; St. Catherine's Hospital the alleged
                  negligence occurred, an offer to settle that would have netted
                  him a cool seventy thousand: &quot;If I take the money,&quot;
                  he tells the Bishop, &quot;I am lost.&quot; Later, he rejects
                  Mickey's counsel to settle (&quot;When they give you the money
                  that means you've won&quot;) by declaring, with somber conviction,
                  &quot;I'm going to stand up for that girl.&quot; And he tells
                  Laura, on her second appearance at the bar, after his failed
                  ham-handed attempt to pick her up at their first meeting, &quot;I
                  changed my life today.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But his conviction is false,
                  as false and hollow as his long-sought victory, the very next
                  morning, first drink at hand, over the pinball machine. Witness
                  his dinner conversation with Laura (&quot;The weak have got to
                  have someone to fight for them. Ain't that the truth. Want another
                  drink&quot;) and his provocative, silly, self-serving behavior
                  at the first chambers conference with the trial judge (Milo O'Shea)
                  and defendant's counsel Ed Concannon (James Mason) (the judge:
                  &quot;It seems to me a fellow's trying to come back, he'd take
                  the settlement. I myself would take it and run like a thief&quot;;
                  Galvin: &quot;I'm sure you would&quot;). His off-the-rack conversion
                  deforms straightaway into bravado, perhaps indeed into hubris.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Frank is soon to learn that
                  painless, voluntaristic change provides neither self-recognition
                  nor life affirmation. When his star witness Dr. Gruber (who,
                  with his own cigar-munching bravado, promised to testify against
                  St. Catherine's and the &quot;most respected&quot; Drs. Marx
                  and Towler that &quot;her doctors killed her ... the doctors
                  murdered her ... I don't want those bozos in the same profession
                  as me&quot;) turns prudent coward and disappears to the Caribbean,
                  when Judge Hoyle pays back his bravado by denying his on-knees-begging
                  request for a continuance (&quot;This case should never have
                  come to trial. But you know better. You're mister independent.
                  You want to be independent? Be independent now. I have no sympathy
                  for you&quot;), when Concannon's firm rejects his hyperventilating,
                  late-night offer to accept a revived offer: when confronted with
                  hard reality, Frank dissolves into a puddle of boozy self-pity,
                  panic, anxiety -- and cowardice. &quot;We're going to lose,&quot;
                  he whines child-like to Laura, &quot;it's over ... Do you think
                  that it's my fault? That I could have ... oh God, I never should
                  have taken it, there's no way I could win.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Galvin's salvation, if it is
                  to be, lies in his mustering the courage to affirm the tragic
                  dimensions of his lawyerly world and to recognize the possibilities,
                  real and not imagined, of his place in it. Galvin must come to
                  terms, not only with all-too-human limitations of law and justice,
                  but also with the costs, the real costs and not those he has
                  conveniently chosen, to his life of his authentically serving
                  both. It is Laura who sets him on his way and who, at the end,
                  secures his redemption.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Unlike all the others who populate
                  his world, the lads at the bar, the denizens of the court, colleagues
                  and attendants alike, and Mickey especially (&quot;Do you like
                  that story, Laura? What else do you want to know about Frankie?&quot;),
                  all of whom finally defer to Frank's carefully constructed self-regarding
                  victimhood, Laura refuses him the comfy security of his boozy
                  irresponsibility. She refuses to play the enabling mommy to his
                  child. She shreds his dress of hurt and leaves him naked: &quot;You
                  want me to tell you it's your fault. Okay, it probably is. But
                  what are you going to do about it?&quot; &quot;I wanted to talk
                  to you. I thought maybe....&quot; Laura will have none of it:
                  &quot;Maybe you could get some sympathy. You come to the wrong
                  place.&quot; &quot;What makes you so tough? Maybe I'll tell you
                  that later. Is there going to be a later?&quot; Then crucially:
                  &quot;Not if you don't grow up. You're like a kid. You're coming
                  in here like it is Sunday night, you want me to say you have
                  a fever so you don't have to go back to school. ... You want
                  to be a failure, then do it some place else.&quot; Thus, after
                  a final collapse -- &quot;Please don't. Please don't pressure
                  me. Please don't.&quot; -- is forged Frank's authentic epiphany:
                  sitting at the sleeping Laura's bedside, he acknowledges, first
                  with silent stare, then with forehead kiss, these truths of his
                  past and present and the possibility of another, different future
                  truth.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Frank's resurrection from self-absorption
                  permits him, perhaps for the first time in his life, to experience
                  the world in a way that does not center his own situation, that
                  avoids privileging his own disappointment. Gone is the easy cynicism
                  bred of brute knowledge of human frailty of the sort he displayed
                  in the first chambers conference (compare his speech at the second:
                  &quot;Don't give me that shit about you being a lawyer too. I
                  know about you. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were a
                  bagman for the boys downtown and you still are. I know about
                  you.&quot;). Gone too is the romantic perfectionist reverie of
                  the sort he offered to Laura over dinner on their second meeting,
                  in his scheme, as he put it to Mickey, &quot;to get laid.&quot;
                  In their place, and in his place, he puts acknowledgment of others
                  and of the sorry, and wonderful, possibilities of frail, imperfect
                  creatures, he like them. These other voices -- class (Kevin Donneghy,
                  obstetrics nurse Maureen Rooney), gendered (admitting nurse Kaitlin
                  Costello Price -- &quot;who were these men&quot; -- and Laura
                  herself) and racial (Dr. Thompson -- the frail seventy-four-year-old
                  African-American M.D. who alone will replace the absconding Gruber
                  -- and all, the court, Concannon, Mickey, who react to his being
                  black) -- disclose to Frank, not all at once, but progressively
                  over the piece, and culminating in his closing address to the
                  jury, the reality of a world that resists correspondence with
                  his own circumstance, his feelings, his experiences, that is
                  grander, in its frailty and possibility, than his life alone.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">When Kevin Donneghy, a self-described
                  &quot;working man,&quot; accosts Frank at the courthouse for
                  failing to seek his and his wife's instructions on the offer
                  to settle, Frank is bewildered. To Donneghy's words--&quot;You
                  guys, you guys are all the same. The doctors at the hospital,
                  you, it's always what I'm going to do for you. And then you screw
                  up and it's ah, we did the best that we could, I'm dreadfully
                  sorry, and people like us live with your mistakes the rest of
                  our lives&quot;-- Frank can only muster a shrug, and a sheepish,
                  &quot;They took back the offer.&quot; He reacts differently when
                  Maureen Rooney responds with class anger and contempt to his
                  attempt to strong-arm information. Rooney: &quot;You guys are
                  the same. You don't care who you hurt. All you care about is
                  the dollar. You're a bunch of whores.&quot; Galvin says nothing;
                  but, in the camera close-up, tight on his face, he communicates
                  shocked awareness of this other truth; he hears and confronts
                  it. So, too, when he reacts to Dr. Thompson's departing counsel,
                  his case then in shambles: &quot;You know Mr. Galvin sometimes
                  people can surprise you, sometimes they have a great capacity
                  to hear the truth&quot;; Galvin, distractively, &quot;yeah&quot;,
                  then hopefully &quot;yes.&quot; And finally the closing address,
                  in which he rejects victimhood as a way of experiencing life
                  and expresses, to himself as much as to the jury, his matured
                  belief in law as human aspiration, &quot;a fervent and frightened
                  prayer&quot;, to be freed from power's insistent claims, which
                  finally depends upon faith, faith by its practitioner stewards
                  and faith by the people to whom and for whom they are responsible.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Galvin's faith is immediately
                  put to the test and in a manner which reveals to him, and to
                  us, the tragic burden of authentically serving the law. In the
                  beautifully executed scene between Concannon and Laura, we learn,
                  from his speech and from her silence, both the conceit of feckless
                  lawyerly performance and of her betrayal, as a lawyer, of Frank
                  and of her profession. Once an associate in Concannon's New York
                  partner's office, now returning to the law after a failed marriage,

                  Laura has been acting as Concannon's paid informant. Profession
                  devolves from confession of the sort made by Frank in his closing
                  address; and the test of authentic confession, and consequently
                  the cost of authentic professionalism, is the subordination of
                  personal life and morality to public life and its specifically
                  communal values and demands. Despite the ripening of love between
                  them -- &quot;I feel the same way Frank&quot; -- Frank's verdict,
                  his refusal to answer Laura's call to private life, to love and
                  reconciliation, with which the film ends, is his acknowledgment
                  of those values and his satisfaction of those demands. Who is
                  Frank Galvin? With this, he answers: he is a lawyer to his very
                  roots.<br>
