      <p align="center"><small><strong>&quot;The Law of Rules&quot;</strong> by John Denvir</small></p>
      <p></blockquote></font><font color="#008080" face="Verdana" size="5"><strong>I</strong></font><font face="Verdana"><small> think many students choose law school because they see law as a
      tool of justice. I know I did. In part, the image of law I came from was shaped by the
      exploits of civil rights attorneys like Bobby Kennedy in the early 60's. But I was also
      very much influenced by &quot;movie&quot; lawyers like Gregory Peck in <em>To Kill a
      Mockingbird</em> and James Stewart in <em>Anatomy of a Murder</em>.</small><p>
      <p><small>Now the connection between law and justice seems much more problematic. Maybe it
      was always problematic. In <em>To Kill A Mockingbird</em>, Gregory Peck&#146;s innocent
      client was found guilty while Jimmy Stewart&#146;s guilty client in <em>Anatomy of a
      Murder</em> was found innocent. And come to think of it, historians have shown that Bobby
      Kennedy was more interested in electing his brother President than in bringing racial
      justice to the South. His &quot;heroic&quot; acts were really forced upon him by civil
      rights leaders like Martin Luther King. </small></p>
      <p><small>At least <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> and <em>Anatomy of a Murder</em> held
      out</small><img align="right" alt="harry.JPG (14258 bytes)" hspace="12" src="images/harry.JPG" vspace="12" width="166" height="188"><small>
      the possibility that law led to justice; most Hollywood films prefer to see law as an
      obstacle to the achievement of justice. Take , for instance, <em>Dirty Harry</em>. You
      will remember that at the end of that movie, Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) has finally
      been able to elicit a confession from a psychopathic child killer by utilizing the type of
      extra-legal persuasion for which Dirty Harry has become famous. When he&#146;s called to
      the District Attorney&#146;s Office, Harry expects to receive a commendation. Instead, the
      District Attorney informs him that he has violated the suspect&#146;s constitutional
      rights. The DA even has a retired judge calmly explain why the &quot;law &quot; requires
      that this psychopath must be released. Harry warns the DA that the suspect will kill
      again; and, as usual, Harry is right; the released suspect continues to kill until Harry
      finally shoots him down. Violence achieves the justice that law could not. This is not the
      kind of story which motivates people to take LSAT. </small></p>
      <p><small>As a law professor, I am always looking for &quot;positive&quot; images of
      lawyers to hold up for my students&#146; emulation. One current favorite is found only at
      the video store; it&#146;s Antonin Costa-Gavras&#146; political thriller &quot;<em>Z</em>&quot;
      which was made in 1969. It presents a relationship between law and justice diametrically
      opposed to that implied in &quot;Dirty Harry.&quot; Here we see a legal story in which a
      competent (and courageous) judge following established legal procedures is able to make
      the legal system work. You might say that Costa-Gavras shows us that the rule of law must
      also be a &quot;law of rules.&quot;</small></p>
      <p><small>The plot is based on an actual political assassination in Greece in the 1960's.
      A popular democratic leftist politician (Yves Montand) is clubbed to death by thugs allied
      with the right-wing police force. The police deny any connection with the
      &quot;accident.&quot; A judicial investigation begins under the supervision of a young
      magistrate (Jean-Louis Trintignant). Since the young judge comes from the same social
      background as the police and shares their antipathy for the leftist opposition, he is at
      first more than willing to accept their version of the events. </small></p>
      <p><small>But he is also a legal professional, trained in sophisticated procedures for
      taking and evaluating evidence. We see two dramas unfold. One is the judge&#146;s slow
      realization that he is not dealing with an accident, but rather a political assassination
      followed by an official cover-up. He at first resists this conclusion, but his legal
      training requires him to exhaustively interview witnesses and cross-check their testimony
      against official records and the testimony of other witnesses. Slowly his fidelity to
      proper legal method overcomes his social and political prejudice.</small></p>
      <p><small>The second drama is the insidious manner in which the political considerations
      threaten to undermine the autonomy of the legal investigation. The District Attorney
      announces that the judge is in complete charge of the investigation, but at first subtly
      and then not so subtly attempts to guide him to a predetermined politically acceptable
      legal conclusion. When attempts at persuasion fail, they are replaced by veiled, and not
      so veiled, threats of retaliation. Still the young judge indicts the Chief of Police.</small></p>
      <p><small>Here is the moral I draw from &quot;<em>Z</em>.&quot; The &quot;rule of
      law&quot; can produce justice; law is a cultural achievement about which we should be very
      proud. But the procedures do not work automatically. They require lawyers and judges who
      possess both keen intellect and moral courage because law is always in danger of being
      subverted by politics, and legal forms are always capable of being corrupted towards
      political ends.</small></p>
      <p><small>Of course, Greece in the 60's is not America at the end of the millennium, but I
      think we can find situations in recent American legal history analogous to the events
      portrayed in &quot;<em>Z</em>&quot;. The parallels with the Watergate Scandal are quite
      striking. Both were politically motivated crimes which an official cover-up attempted to
      pass off as petty crimes. And in both situations, the attempts at cover-up were defeated
      by the slow accumulation of evidence by skilled government attorneys. </small></p>
      <p><small>Unfortunately, the &quot;good guys&quot; don&#146;t always win. In the 1980's
      Special</small><img align="right" alt="montage.JPG (18080 bytes)" hspace="12" src="images/montage.JPG" vspace="8" width="187" height="205"><small>
      Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh and a team of skilled lawyers painstakingly put together a
      strong case against government officials for their subversion of the Constitution in the
      Iran-Contra scandal. But Attorney General Edwin Meese was able to foil the prosecution in
      the name of &quot;national security.&quot; Politics always threatens to undermine the
      autonomy of law. In fact, a coda to &quot;<em>Z</em>&quot; explains that the final
      consequence of the young judge&#146;s heroic actions was a military coup.</small></p>
      <p><small>If law hopes to be successful in achieving justice, it must always remain
      impartial. In &quot;<em>Z</em>&quot; the young judge&#146;s political naivete proved a
      strength because no one doubted the integrity of his findings. Here we can use the
      impeachment of President Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice as a negative
      lesson. Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr violated this first rule of the &quot;law of
      rules&quot;-- the appearance of impartiality. The truth or falsity of Clinton&#146;s
      testimony very quickly got lost in the argument over whether or not the impeachment was a
      Republican vendetta against the President. </small></p>
      <p><small>I guess the relationship between law and justice will always remain problematic.
      But it&#146;s a problem which can at least sometimes be solved by lawyers who are smart
      enough, work hard enough, and have sufficient courage. It&#146;s doesn&#146;t always work,
      but&#150;no matter what Clint Eastwood says&#150;it beats lawlessness. </small></p>
