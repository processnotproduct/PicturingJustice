                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Timothy Cairo</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Anger is an emotion that is
                  particularly difficult to locate upon the moral spectrum. Unlike
                  greed or happiness, the actions that result from anger are of
                  such a broad variation that it is equally plausible to characterize
                  the emotion as positive as it is to determine it negative. In
                  zeroing in on anger as a catalyst to progressive social change,
                  Bell Hooks defines the emotion as a positive force, and as a
                  necessary requirement for leveling societal inequalities. On
                  the other hand, April A. Gerlock's study of war veterans and
                  their responses to anger presents the emotion as an inherently
                  negative force which tends to give rise to de-humanization and
                  violence. Upon the surface it appears that these divergent views
                  of anger are irreconcilable, however, if we look outside the
                  realm of academic discourse to mainstream culture it is possible
                  to find portrayals of anger that are able to negotiate these,
                  seemingly, conflicting views of the emotion, suggesting that
                  these views are indeed compatible. David Fincher's 1999 film
                  <i>Fight Club</i> provides a representation of anger, over the
                  course of its narrative that depicts the emotion, both, as a
                  positive force of social change as well as a stimulus for violence
                  and de-humanization. By employing Aristotle's definition of anger,
                  and analyzing the emotion within the context of different stages
                  of the film's narrative, it will become clear how both Hooks
                  and Gerlock's opinions can co-exist within a rounded portrayal
                  of the emotion of anger.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/fightclub.jpg" width="200" height="137" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Aristotle defines anger as, &quot;an
                  impulse, accompanied by pain, to a conspicuous revenge for a
                  conspicuous slight directed without justification towards what
                  concerns oneself or towards what concerns one's friends,&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">1</a>). In <i>Fight Club</i>, Ed Norton's character
                  Cornelius is presented as an angry and disenfranchised office
                  employee on the verge of a breakdown. Aristotle maintains that
                  to feel anger one must have been slighted by a specific individual
                  (<a href="#footnotes">2</a>), however, Cornelius like Bell Hooks
                  in her article &quot;<i>Killing Rage</i>&quot; feels slighted
                  by society at large, creating an anger that, like Hooks', is
                  complex in its manifestation and in its direction. Cornelius'
                  anger is multi-faceted, he feels that society has slighted him
                  through mass-marketed promises of fame, fortune, and excitement
                  while, instead, delivering a reality of conformity, personal
                  commoditification, and occupational slavery. Cornelius' alter-ego
                  Tyler succinctly defines the source of Cornelius and his cronies'
                  anger in a monologue later in the film: <br>
                  &quot;Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, having us
                  working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We have
                  no great war; no great depression&#133; our great depression
                  is our lives. We're all raised on television to believe we're
                  gonna be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we
                  won't, and we're starting to learn that fact, and we're very,
                  very pissed off.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Cornelius desires to accomplish
                  something monumental, but even beyond that he longs to take control
                  of his destiny and to stop fearing death. However, as much as
                  he is enraged by modern society, and desires change it is the
                  comforts of this society that inhibit him from taking action.
                  Bell Hooks suggests that upper class African Americans often
                  suppress their rage &quot;because their lives are comfortable,&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">3</a>) a theme that is reflected in <i>Fight
                  Club</i> by Cornelius' Ikea furniture and his designer wardrobe
                  which act as a diversion from his anger and disdain towards modern
                  commercial culture. By inhibiting his rage, Cornelius eliminates
                  any possibility of change and takes on a hopeless existence,
                  illustrated by his acceptance of the role of someone who is terminally
                  ill; each night attending a different meeting devoted to helping
                  people cope with their impending death. <br>
<br>
                  Throughout its first act <i>Fight Club</i> makes continual suggestions
                  that Cornelius' frustration and anger is intrinsically linked
                  to some sort of crisis of masculinity. It is not by chance that
                  the first group meeting Cornelius attends is for men who have
                  had their testicles removed due to cancer. Nor is it coincidence
                  that Tyler, when consoling Cornelius on the destruction of his
                  condo says, &quot;It could be worse, a woman could cut off your
                  penis while you're sleeping and throw it out the window of a
                  moving car&quot;. And most importantly, it is not by co-incidence
                  that it is the appearance of a woman at Cornelius' group meetings
                  that causes him to abandon his hopelessness and re-embrace his
                  anger. In the context of the film Marla Singer's character is
                  symbolic of the freedom and assertiveness that Cornelius associates
                  with the male gender and longs for as a result. Where Cornelius
                  has become dependent on the group meetings in order to function
                  from day to day, Marla attends merely on a whim, explaining to
                  him that, &quot;It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee&quot;.
                  Marla further asserts her power over the relationship between
                  her and Cornelius by refusing to cease her attendance of the
                  meetings despite Cornelius' heartfelt appeals and his confession
                  that he is unable to swallow his anger so long as she continues
                  to be present. It is this disregard for Cornelius' needs that
                  leads him to re-embrace his anger, a natural result according
                  to Aristotle who writes, <br>
                  &quot;Thus a sick man is angered by disregard for his illness,
                  a poor man by disregard for his poverty, a man waging war by
                  disregard for the war he is raging, a lover by disregard for
                  his love, and so throughout, any other sort of slight being enough
                  if special slights are wanting.&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">4</a>)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">However, it is not only due
                  to Marla's disregard that Cornelius re-discovers his anger, but
                  also through his envy of Marla as well. Marla gracefully controls
                  her own destiny without a fear of death, or a dependency on material
                  things, a freedom Cornelius longs for and resents in her, not
                  only because she possess these qualities, but more accurately
                  because she is a woman who possess these qualities. Now feeling
                  even more ineffective as a man Cornelius creates his alter-ego,
                  Tyler Durden, in order to cope with his anger, but in doing so
                  manages to achieve something positive in the process, a result
                  that is very much in accord with the pro-anger writings of Bell
                  Hooks.<br>
<br>
                  Granted, most people would not consider the creation of a club
                  where men congregate to pound the tar out of each other to be
                  a positive achievement. However, within the, somewhat twisted,
                  logic of the film the fight clubs created by Cornelius and his
                  alter-ego Tyler are held out to be both a positive and a monumental
                  creation. Within the context of the film, the fight clubs are
                  presented as filling some estranged need of the attendees rather
                  than functioning as the source of any kind of sadistic pleasure.
                  They are compared by Cornelius to a &quot;Pentecostal Church&quot;,
                  which is a metaphor for the clubs' role as a sacred ritual of
                  masculinity, too long absent from civilized society. By putting
                  the fight clubs into this context the film presents them as a
                  positive institution; a cathartic need for disenfranchised males,
                  like Cornelius, to assert their masculinity in the least harmful
                  manner possible. To Cornelius' surprise, many others share his
                  sentiments and before he knows it fight club has become a national
                  phenomenon which satiates his desire to accomplish something
                  truly monumental, even if it fails to grant him the ability to
                  overcome his fear of death and grant him the control over his
                  destiny that he continues to long for. <br>
<br>
                  Bell hooks writes that &quot;Like all profound repression, my
                  rage unleashed made me afraid. It forced me to turn my back on
                  forgetfulness, called me out of my denial. It changed my relationship
                  with home- with the South- made it so I could not return there&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">5</a>). These changes that Hooks describes
                  arising in herself as a by-product of tapping her rage are directly
                  paralleled by Cornelius' situation in <i>Fight Club</i>. It is
                  Cornelius' rage, forged by modern society and spurred by Marla
                  that incites him to undertake the endeavor of creating fight
                  club. Cornelius too changes his &quot;relationship with home&quot;
                  so that he &quot;could not return&quot;, symbolized in the film
                  by the destruction of his condo and the creation of Tyler who
                  becomes the personification of Cornelius' rage and the catalyst
                  to the creation of fight club. However, although <i>Fight Club
                  </i>agrees with Hooks regarding the fact that rage can be very
                  useful as an inciting factor behind social change the film is
                  cautious to take the argument too far. Where Hooks maintains
                  that anger is the combustion engine behind social change, <i>Fight
                  Club</i> limits anger's role to that of a spark plug, essential
                  to begin the movement, but once initiated, the film maintains,
                  that driving is best left to more stable and dependable forces.
                  This is illustrated in the film as Tyler's rage continues to
                  grow beyond fight club, leading to the initiation of Project
                  Mayhem.<br>
<br>
                  Gerlock observes that, &quot;Military training is reported (Eisenhart
                  1975) as equating rage and anger with masculine identity in the
                  performance of military duty&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">6</a>)
                  . This is certainly paralleled in the third act of <i>Fight Club</i>,
                  where Cornelius and Tyler, in accordance with Hooks' writings,
                  allow their rage to govern the evolution of fight club, and in
                  attempt to further assert their masculinity against the lingering
                  specter of Marla Singer, give birth to the militaristic endeavor
                  of Project Mayhem. Project Mayhem attempts to &quot;take fight
                  club out of the basements&quot; through militia-like guerrilla
                  tactics, but quickly spins out of control, succeeding only in
                  violence and de-humanization. Gerlock elaborates on this theme,
                  explaining that, &quot;In a combat zone the dehumanization of
                  others can expand beyond just the enemy (Shatan 1978). Horowitz
                  and Solomon (1978 p. 278) assert that &quot;&#133; problems of
                  control over violent impulses are complicated whenever real violence
                  has occurred, whenever human beings are dehumanized or devalued,
                  and whenever reality and fantasy images are fused&quot;,&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">7</a>). This passage by Gerlock clearly summarizes
                  the dangers of allowing anger to be the guiding force behind
                  one's actions as encouraged by Bell Hooks. These concerns are
                  reflected in <i>Fight Club</i> through the film's negative portrayal
                  of Project Mayhem. By fusing &quot;reality and fantasy images&quot;
                  in the form of Tyler Durden and the unrealistic goals of the
                  Project, Cornelius institutes a regime that instills in its members
                  the very things that fight club was designed to negate. The blind
                  faith formerly placed in commodity culture is transformed into
                  blind faith in Project Mayhem, to which the first rule is &quot;you
                  do not ask questions&quot;. The former rejection of mass-marketing
                  and big business is contradicted by Project Mayhem's large scale
                  publicity stunts and nation-wide franchises. Even fight club's
                  hostility towards the conformity of office culture disappears
                  within the regime of Project Mayhem which demands uniform military
                  style haircuts and fatigues. All these factors, born out of anger,
                  evidence the failure of Project Mayhem on the basis of its own
                  hypocrisy as well as the dehumanizing effect of the Project's
                  demand for complete conformity to its militaristic regime. <br>
<br>
                  Gerlock also cites violence as a by-product of anger fuelled
                  military cultures. This too is presented in <i>Fight Club</i>
                  as evidence of the ultimate failure of the rage-driven Project
                  Mayhem. Where the fight clubs employed violence as a ritual enacted
                  upon those who consent to fight, upon the advent of Project Mayhem
                  this violence is re-directed, towards society at large. The anger
                  of Project Mayhem ultimately leads to violence in many forms,
                  including the threatening of the city's police chief at knife
                  point, the destruction of ten office towers, the near murder
                  of Marla Singer, and the death of Bob Paulson. It is Bob's death
                  that forces Cornelius to re-assess the effectiveness of Project
                  Mayhem and realize that action driven solely out of rage, as
                  suggested by Gerlock, can only lead to de-humanization and violence.
                  This epiphany on Cornelius' part allows him to ultimately form
                  the conclusion that in order to put an end to Project Mayhem
                  he must purge his anger, which is personified by Tyler Durden.
                  To eliminate, both, his anger as well as Tyler, Cornelius reasons
                  that he must eliminate himself, and in attempt to do so puts
                  a pistol in his mouth and pulls the trigger. It is this act that
                  signifies Cornelius' acquisition of that which he has sought
                  over the entire course of the narrative; that is to no longer
                  fear death and to gain control of his own destiny. In attempting
                  to end his own life Cornelius gains propriety of both these things,
                  but it is only by first deciding to purge his anger that he is
                  able to achieve this eventual success. Thus, the film maintains
                  that although anger can be a motivating factor in achieving positive
                  results (i.e. the monumental success of fight club), if anger
                  is the only factor driving an action it can only lead to violence
                  and de-humanization. By purging his anger, Cornelius' gains those
                  things that have eluded him throughout the film and finally is
                  able to interact with Marla as an equal, illustrated in the last
                  shot of the film which portrays Cornelius and Marla for the first
                  time in an equitable position, holding hands in a caring manner,
                  centered symmetrically in the center of the frame. <br>
<br>
                  <i>Fight Club</i> affirms Bell Hooks position that anger can
                  function as a positive force in achieving social change through
                  its portrayal of Cornelius, whose rage motivates him to create
                  fight club, a necessary and lacking institution within the logic
                  of the film. But the film, through its negative portrayal of
                  Project Mayhem, also affirms Gerlock's position which finds anger
                  to be a largely violent and de-humanizing force. Thus, the film
                  is able to synthesize these two seemingly contradictory opinions
                  upon the nature of anger into one somewhat rounded portrayal
                  of the emotion. By applying these seemingly contradictory academic
                  discourses to an artifact of mainstream culture, it can be determined
                  that these views are not in fact as divergent as they might appear,
                  and that they are indeed compatible within a holistic presentation
                  of the emotion of anger. <br>
