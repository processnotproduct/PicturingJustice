                  THE GIRLS CLUB DEBUTS</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A good story needs a strong
                  antagonist. In David E. Kelley's new TV drama series <i>The Girls
                  Club</i>, that antagonist is a big law firm. The first episode
                  of the show represented the law firm and its partners as cruel,
                  rude, bullying, cynical, greedy, sexually harassing monsters.
                  The firm encourages vicious and underhanded competition between
                  associates.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/girlsclub.jpg" width="126" height="217" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The protagonists are three young
                  women trying to make their way as junior associates at a big
                  San Francisco firm. The women--who are roommates and were law
                  school classmates--are way out of their depth. They find themselves
                  among a truly horrible and repulsive collection of sub-human
                  beings, and they are totally clueless about how to take care
                  of themselves.<br>
<br>
                  Lynne (the blonde one) is inexplicably defending a death penalty
                  case all by herself. It is her first trial and she is absurdly
                  under-qualified to handle any sort of trial, much less a death
                  penalty case. The client, a studly young man, supposedly had
                  been having an affair with an older woman whom he supposedly

                  killed for some unknown reason. Lynne naively takes the client's
                  word for it that he's innocent.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The case fizzles out in a mistrial
                  and the client dies in prison (apparently of asphyxiation while
                  masturbating). Lynne receives little support and much harsh criticism
                  from Hahn, an older partner, who sits in the back of the courtroom
                  and needles her. Needless to say, she is terrified, freezes when
                  called on to make her opening statement, and botches her cross
                  examination of a witness and other aspects of the defense. Moreover,
                  Lynne is completely thrown off course when the DA tells Hahn
                  that Lynne is infatuated with her client; Hahn requires her to
                  disclose this to the client (actually, the client is infatuated
                  with her).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Jeannie (the redhead) is inexplicably
                  assigned by partner Spencer Lewis to defend a deposition in a
                  stupid medical malpractice case involving the sister of a partner.
                  A gynecologist fainted while giving the client a pelvic exam
                  and collapsed into her crotch. There is no negligence or wrongdoing
                  here. The firm bullies the physician into settling the case because
                  Jeannie credibly threatens to litigate it to death regardless
                  of costs or the merits. But we discover that Lewis assigned Jeannie
                  to this case because he is sexually harassing her. He hugs and
                  fondles her and promises to give her lots more good experience
                  if she will go out with him. Jeannie has no idea how to deal
                  with this kind of predatory behavior and agrees to have dinner
                  with him. Sexual harassment of staff or female associates is
                  a major problem in law firms, but the theme is handled here in
                  an unsubtle, sledge hammer manner.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Meanwhile, Sarah (the brunette)
                  is enmeshed in a vicious rivalry with another associate named
                  Rhanda. Both are competing for the favor of Meredith, a cynical
                  and unpleasant female partner who is called &quot;the praying
                  mantis&quot; behind her back. Meredith claims that she is the
                  last bastion of masculinity in the firm, because a woman must
                  be even more masculine than the men to survive in this Darwinian
                  environment. <br>
                  Rhanda tells Sarah to write her portion of a brief in long flowing
                  sentences--so, needless to say, Meredith thinks Sarah is an unqualified
                  jerk who can't write. As a result of her skillful maneuvering,
                  Rhanda gets to argue the motion and Sarah is in Meredith's dog
                  house. We don't, however, learn anything about what this case
                  is actually about. Sarah tells off Rhanda in the hallway, calling
                  her a &quot;dyke&quot; in the hearing of everybody within miles.
                  This nearly gets Sarah fired and she has to spend 10 weekends
                  taking anger management courses (time for which she can't even
                  bill!). Another associate (Mitchell, known as &quot;The Worm&quot;)
                  tells her to start looking for a new job.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">To me, the show was very disappointing
                  in terms of its legal content. The death penalty case and the
                  malpractice case were just silly. Basically, all three plots
                  dealt in some way with sexual issues (sometimes with several
                  sexual issues), apparently on the theory that this is all the
                  audience really cares about. As compared to <i>The Practice</i>
                  or <i>Law and Order</i>, there was nothing remotely approaching
                  thematic material of interest in terms of law practice or professional
                  responsibility. The legal material was as lightweight as <i>Ally
                  McBeal</i> even though the show is a drama, not a comedy. Hopefully,
                  Kelley will come up with much more interesting legal substance
                  in future shows or this viewer won't be tuning in again.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Girls Club</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is, however, interesting in a different
                  way. It is part of a recurring theme found in novels and films
                  which demonize large law firms. The Harris Poll asks each year
                  about the public's opinion of various institutions. Law firms
                  bring up the absolute bottom of the list--behind such suspect
                  institutions as Congress, the media, labor union officials, the
                  military, or big corporations. (As a result of recent corporate
                  scandals, big business will probably plunge into the sewer along
                  with law firms.) Sadly, novels and films reflect (and perhaps
                  reinforce) the public's contempt and hatred for law firms.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">John Grisham is the best selling
                  novelist in the world. In Grisham's novels, law firms are consistently
                  represented as pits of corruption and all-around evil. Obviously,
                  <i>The Firm</i> is the best example--a respected tax law firm
                  turns out to be a collection of killers and a front for the mob.
                  However, in many other Grisham novels, both big and small law
                  firms are shown as greedy, disgusting, unethical institutions--think
                  of <i>The Street Lawyer</i>, <i>The Rainmaker</i>, <i>The Partner</i>,
                  <i>The Testament</i>, and <i>The Runaway Jury</i> among others.
                  (<i>The Chamber</i> is an exception--a big law firm is supportive
                  of an associate who takes on a death penalty case pro bono.)
                  Numerous other novels have imitated Grisham's approach and vilified
                  law firms.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">And it's not just books. The
                  same is true in film--and not only adaptations of Grisham's books
                  like <i>The Firm</i> and <i>The Rainmaker</i>. Numerous other
                  films, some of them very good, have trashed law firms. Just think
                  of <i>The Devil's Advocate</i>, <i>Regarding Henry</i>, <i>Liar
                  Liar</i>, <i>The Verdict</i>, <i>Class Action</i>, and <i>Philadelphia</i>,
                  among others. In each of them, law firms and their partners are
                  represented as greedy, unethical, homophobic scoundrels. In my
                  article <i>Embodiment of Evil: Law Firms in the Movies</i>, 48
                  UCLA L. Rev. 1339 (2001), I sought to identify and explain this
                  phenomenon and to question whether real law firms were anything
                  like their bad filmic counterparts.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Until now, law firms have been
                  treated benignly on television. <i>LA Law</i> treated the firm
                  of McKenzie, Brackman as the place where many legal and personal
                  stories were situated; the firm itself was seldom vilified (although
                  some partners like Brackman or Becker were represented negatively).
                  <i>The Practice</i> treats a small firm in a favorable way--the
                  lawyers and staff are mutually supportive and idealistic. <i>The
                  First Years</i> (an ill-fated TV series which debuted and quickly
                  died last year) sometimes showed some of the negative aspects
                  of big firm practice, but the stories were too silly to be treated
                  as an indictment of the institution.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But <i>The Girls Club</i> is
                  another matter entirely. Here the enemy is the law firm itself--not
                  opposing lawyers, prosecutors, judges, or evil clients. The firm
                  is a clone of the firms in Grisham novels or films like <i>The
                  Devil's Advocate</i> or <i>Class Action</i>. It consists of truly
                  disgusting partners who oppress and harass young associates and
                  encourage vicious rivalries among them. It is dog-eat-dog, profit-maximizing,
                  and in all ways repulsive. It is a horrible place to work. The
                  series will certainly reinforce the public's view that law firms
                  are the pits of evil. Fortunately, if the debut show is any indication
                  of the show's quality, it will quickly disappear. But what do
                  I know? I said the same thing about <i>Ally McBeal</i>.<br>
