                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Paul Bergman</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Minority Report</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is a Steven Spielberg film based on
                  a story by Phillip K. Dick. It is scheduled for release about
                  10 days after I write this brief analysis. I attended a studio
                  screening to which a number of law professors were invited.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/minorityreport.jpg" width="175" height="103" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The
                  story is a futuristic thriller set in Washington, D.C. in the
                  mid-21st century. The basic concept is that three people called
                  &quot;Pre-Cogs&quot; have the ability to predict murder. Based
                  on the Pre-Cogs' unerring accuracy, D.C. has enacted preventive
                  detention laws that allow officials to arrest people before they
                  can commit crimes and hold them indefinitely in a kind of animated
                  suspension. Tom Cruise portrays the official who interprets the
                  Pre-Cogs' visual images and tries to locate and arrest the murderers
                  before crimes can take place. The program has been extremely
                  successful -- D.C. has gone years without a murder. In fact,
                  the country is soon to vote on an initiative that would extend
                  the program nationwide.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Without giving away too much
                  of the story, I can say that even those who are vaguely familiar
                  with the films of Alfred Hitchcock will recognize that <i>Minority
                  Report</i> pays homage to one of his most familiar themes, the
                  &quot;innocent man on the run.&quot; (Fans of Hitchcock's Spellbound
                  will especially appreciate <i>Minority Report</i>'s conclusion.)
                  Like a Hitchcock film, <i>Minority Report</i> has nice touches
                  of humor, especially when the action moves to a shopping center
                  in which all the stores know customers' purchase history. Many
                  sequences are visually compelling, particularly the sequences
                  in which Cruise orchestrates the Pre-Cogs' images in an effort
                  to understand their message. The music, by John Williams, is
                  often soaring. The ultra-squeamish should be advised, however,
                  that the film does contain a short bit of gore.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Minority Report</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> raises interesting questions about
                  some fundamental criminal law issues. United States criminal
                  law policy has always been to punish people who do (or attempt
                  to do) evil deeds, not people who think evil thoughts or even
                  plan evil deeds, so long as those deeds stay strictly in the
                  planning realm. In part, this policy is based on a sense that
                  all of us think evil thoughts at one time or another, and we
                  have no way of predicting whose thoughts will become concrete
                  deeds. But what if we could know ahead of time, with certainty,
                  the identities of those who will shortly kill? Isn't it preferable
                  to prevent harm than to punish after harm has taken place? Why
                  would we have to be 100% certain of accuracy before permitting
                  preventive detention, when we permit executions based on &quot;beyond
                  a reasonable doubt&quot;? On the other hand, once a killing is
                  prevented, is it necessary to lock a person away forever? Studies
                  suggest that many killings are done in the heat of a moment;
                  once that moment passes, couldn't many people be trusted not
                  to kill?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Questions such as these are
                  not merely academic. Following the killing spree by two teenagers
                  at Columbine High School in Colorado, other children were arrested
                  based on plans to commit violence that they had revealed to others
                  or written about in private diaries. In California and other
                  states, sex offenders can be kept in prison indefinitely, even
                  after their sentences expire, based on expert opinions that the
                  offenders remain a threat to repeat their acts. In the months
                  following the Sept. 11, 2001 tragedy at the World Trade Center,
                  a number of Muslims have been detained based on evidence that
                  they planned to do evil. And in garden-variety personal conflicts,
                  judges often issue &quot;restraining orders&quot; to try to prevent
                  one person from harming another.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In none of these situations,
                  admittedly, has the information leading to detention or other
                  restrictions on freedom been provided by fortune-tellers. However,
                  popular confidence in the conclusions of &quot;hard scientists&quot;
                  is probably lower, and popular confidence in psychic predictions
                  is probably higher, than many of us would like to believe. By
                  mid-century, who is to say that scientists won't be able to provide
                  predictions that are solid enough for us as a society to accept
                  preventive detention?</font></p>
