                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If you are ready to regain
                  a healthy skepticism about America's use of military power in
                  the post-9/11 era, there is a film at your local video store
                  available to assist you. I skipped <i>Three Kings</i> by director/screenwriter
                  David Russell (<i>Flirting with Disaster</i>) when it was released
                  in the final months of the twentieth century, because the studio
                  promoted it as an action/adventure flick. However, Amazon.com
                  describes it as &quot;a confident hybrid of <i>M*A*S*H</i>, <i>Treasure
                  of the Sierra Madre</i>, and <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>,&quot; and
                  that's pretty close. I would add <i>Catch-22</i> to that list,
                  and argue that <i>Three Kings</i> is the best film to date about
                  the morality of America's military policing actions.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/threekings.JPG.jpg" width="210" height="141" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The setting is the
                  Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm), immediately after the 1991
                  cease-fire. The U.S. and its allies had just completed a military
                  campaign that killed more than 100,000 Iraqis and destroyed the
                  civilian infrastructure of Baghdad. After regaining control of
                  Kuwaiti oil fields, America stopped the war abruptly, leaving
                  Saddam the Satan still in power. Groups in the south and north
                  then rose up in rebellion at the U.S.'s urging, but unchallenged
                  Iraqi soldiers were slaughtering whole villages. (Some of the
                  survivors serve as extras in the film.)<br>
<br>
                  The number of Americans killed was so small that deaths from
                  accidents and friendly fire exceeded the number killed by the
                  enemy. Most U.S. troops never saw any bloodshed; as portrayed
                  in the film, the war for them was like a camping trip in the
                  desert.<br>
<br>
                  Russell could not have foreseen that his film, where U.S. soldiers
                  operating as outlaws bully Arabs by flashing bogus letters of
                  authorization from President Bush, would have such hyper-relevance
                  in 2002. As we struggle to reconcile basic tenants of international
                  law and humanity with America's War on Terrorism, <i>Three Kings</i>
                  serves as a reminder of how national self-interest and hubris
                  can warp ethics. (The U.S. was all too eager to invade Afghanistan,
                  but now wants little to do with making it work as a nation.)<br>
<br>
                  The theme that assaults viewers repeatedly is that most Americans
                  did not see the reality of the Gulf War. U.S. military commanders
                  believed they were fighting a media war, in which winning American
                  public support for the conflict was as important as any military
                  effort to &quot;liberate&quot; Kuwait and &quot;defeat&quot;
                  Iraq. Sound bites that seemed reasonable to American ears when
                  coming out of the mouths of State Department or Pentagon briefers
                  are laughable in the film when uttered by infantrymen who confront
                  Iraqi soldiers, revolutionaries and refugees.<br>
<br>
                  The comedy is at its darkest when an Iraqi army interrogator
                  asks an American soldier he is torturing to explain the difference
                  in their causes, and the soldier (played by Mark Wahlberg) answers
                  in sound bites. The soldier's shallow justification of the need
                  to liberate the people of Kuwait (one of the world's richest
                  nations) seems even more ridiculous than his dark-skinned torturer's
                  desire to exact revenge for the pain suffered by black pop singer
                  Michael Jackson--forced into plastic surgery to conform in a
                  white world.<br>
<br>
                  Another scene lampoons America's expectation that other peoples
                  would blindly follow because America is right. (One post-Gulf
                  War effort was in fact called &quot;Operation Just Cause.&quot;)
                  George Clooney, as the leader of an outlaw incursion into Iraqi
                  territory and one of the &quot;kings&quot; in the title, tries
                  to obtain a fleet of Kuwaiti limousines &quot;liberated&quot;
                  by the Iraqis. Playing a caricature of Uncle Sam in an army recruiting
                  poster, he tries to con Iraqi dissidents into giving him the
                  cars so that he can help them fulfill President Bush's desire
                  that they rise up against Saddam. They join in his pro-American
                  pep rally, but, seeing through his exploitation and false promises,
                  demand payment in full.<br>
<br>
                  Just as during the realm of George I, American officials today
                  explain questionable military and human rights policies by saying
                  that we are the good guys--therefore policies in our national
                  interest must be just and everyone should follow us (that, and
                  the fact that we are strongest military power in the world).
                  The overriding message in the film is that those with institutional
                  values can only see the goals of those institutions. They ignore
                  any reality--no matter how inhumane--that conflicts with those
                  goals. In the new world order, America's narrow wartime agenda
                  has nothing to do with bettering the lives of Arabs.<br>
<br>
                  The film brings this home when, in the end, Clooney and his &quot;kings&quot;
                  face a terrible choice. As outlaws who have rejected institutional
                  values, they are only people capable of humane action.<br>
