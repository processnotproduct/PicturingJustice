                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Paul Bergman</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Desmond Doyle is something
                  of a stock Irish character: an often out-of-work construction
                  worker who has too much fondness for the drink. Desmond's wife
                  runs off with another man, leaving the couple's three school
                  age children in Desmond's care. With no mother in the house and
                  Desmond's ability to provide for the children in serious doubt,
                  the Government/Church (pretty much one and the same entity) place
                  the children in orphanages. Desmond pulls himself together. But
                  his efforts to regain custody of his children are thwarted by
                  an Irish law that regards a motherless home as unfit for raising
                  children. With the help of three lawyers who impress on Desmond
                  the likely futility of a legal challenge, Desmond petitions for
                  the return of his children. The case ends up in front of three
                  judges on Ireland's Supreme Court, who award custody of the children
                  to Desmond by a 2-1 vote.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/evelyn2.jpg" width="184" height="122" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In
                  contrast to many recent films, lawyers can be proud of their
                  portrayal in <i>Evelyn</i>. The lawyers who take on Desmond's
                  case do so for reasons of principle rather than remunerative
                  gain, and formal legal rules give way to the demands of justice.
                  Indeed, lawyers can even be humble. Desmond's solicitor Michael
                  Beattie seeks aid from Nick Barron, an Irish-American barrister
                  with rights of audience in court, and Tom Connolly, a family
                  law expert who comes out of retirement to fight what he sees
                  as an unjust law. Movie viewers would be hard pressed to find
                  a more positive portrayal of a team of lawyers in recent years.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">While I enjoyed the story of
                  <i>Evelyn</i> and left the theater feeling as good as the rest
                  of the audience, I was nonetheless frustrated by the film's simplistic
                  treatment of the legal issues. I felt that the filmmakers' operated
                  from the premise that &quot;we can either make audiences think
                  or feel good, but we can't do both.&quot; As a result, even though
                  the law preventing Desmond from regaining custody of his children
                  must have had positive social consequences, the film says nothing
                  about them. Instead, the government lawyer asking the court to
                  uphold the law is reduced to a nasty cross examination of Evelyn,
                  Desmond's eight year old daughter. The cross examination makes
                  it appear that the crux of the case is whether Evelyn told the
                  truth in a letter to Desmond describing a beating that she suffered
                  in the orphanage at the hands of a nun. (Just the image the Catholic
                  Church needs at a time when many priests have been exposed as
                  pedophiles!) Seemingly, the cross examination serves only to
                  magnify the audience's delight in Desmond's victory.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The character of Tom Connolly
                  further exemplifies the film's inattention to serious legal issues.
                  Tom is supposedly one of Ireland's greatest family law experts,
                  one who has spent the better part of his career trying to fight
                  unjust laws. Connolly warns Desmond that he's fighting an uphill
                  battle, but unfortunately has little to say that sheds light
                  on the legal issues. The lawyers actually institute two legal
                  actions on Desmond's behalf. The first one concludes with a non-appealable
                  trial judge's order that Desmond's children remain in their orphanages.
                  The lawyers then file a second action on new grounds that aren't
                  foreclosed by the earlier adverse judgment. This is the case
                  that results in a favorable outcome for Desmond in the Irish
                  Supreme Court, with the same judge who decided the case against
                  Desmond in the first action issuing a dissenting opinion in the
                  second action.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">These are tough, meaty legal
                  issues. Why is the first order non-appealable? Why is the Irish
                  Supreme Court listening to witnesses, and how can it be that
                  the same judge who decided the case against Desmond the first
                  time around is one of the judges hearing the second case? What
                  is so different about Connolly's legal theory that underlies
                  the second action, and how come the supposedly-impregnable legal
                  establishment can't prevent the second action from going forward?
                  Had <i>Evelyn</i> trusted its audience, we might have witnessed
                  a few fascinating moments of lawyer strategizing and dramatic
                  courtroom arguments. Alas, nothing like this is in the film,
                  and movie goers have to be content with good feelings that are
                  likely to dissipate by the time they've left the theater. <br>
