                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by John Denvir</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">David Kelley has run the dramatic
                  gauntlet; first the legal melodramas <i>L.A. Law</i> and <i>The
                  Practice</i>, then the ironic <i>Ally McBeal</i>, now (as <a href="bostonlegal_papke.htm">David Papke</a> insightfully points
                  out) the satirical <i>Boston Legal</i>. I think <i>Boston Legal</i>
                  is Kelley's last lawyer show; after all, what's left to be done?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/bostonlegal 3.jpg" width="93" height="139" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">I
                  like the basic premise of the show. Law has always been is the
                  symbolic cement that bonds America's diverse society and lawyers
                  have always been the self-appointed guardians of our national
                  political culture; it makes perfectly good sense at this point
                  in our national history to use arrogant, narcissistic, white
                  male lawyers as representatives of our arrogant, narcissistic,
                  white male-dominated political culture. When you think about
                  it, Dick Chaney and Denny Crane are made for each other.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">My problem with the show is
                  not that portrays lawyers negatively, but that it doesn't portray
                  them negatively enough to accomplish its satirical goals. Kelley
                  always pulls his dramatic punches, softening the images of Denny
                  Crane and Allen Shore in order to make them more palatable to
                  the mass audience television pursues. Therefore, in each episode
                  we are given a glimpse of a more &quot;human&quot; side of Crane
                  and/or Shore. We are asked to empathize with Crane for his incipient
                  dementia or with Shore for his occasional endorsement of liberal
                  principles like freedom of speech or opposition to the death
                  penalty. Unfortunately all this does is take the edge off the
                  satire.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">What I like most about the
                  show is Kelley's weekly video op-ed on some current political
                  issue of the day. One week we heard a thoroughly one-sided presentation
                  of the evils of red meat, another a blistering commentary on
                  the State of Texas' penchant for state-sanctioned murder. Of
                  course, I probably like these political interventions because
                  I sympathize with the views presented, but I also find it reassuring
                  to know that Fox News is not the only outlet for political theatre
                  on television.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I also think that <i>Boston
                  Legal</i> will be Kelley's last lawyer show because I don't think
                  that ABC is going to continue to subsidize his political commercials.
                  So what's next? I think we need a &quot;no lawyer&quot; show.
                  Luckily, we have one. It's called <i>Deadwood</i> and I think
                  it best &quot;law&quot; show yet. Deadwood is a mining camp in
                  the Dakotas where David Milch has set his HBO drama. Once the
                  viewer gets by the profanity ( historically accurate according
                  to Milch) we can see <i>Deadwood</i> as a story about the birth
                  of law. The denizens of Deadwood would deny this description;
                  they prefer to see their lives as 'lawless.&quot; But the demands
                  of commerce and the human instinct towards community soon begin
                  to undermine this pretence to a society without law. Human beings
                  need both order and justice, although the concrete design of
                  the institutions chosen to accomplish these goals is always controversial.
                  By the end of the first season of <i>Deadwood</i>, we have not
                  only a sheriff, fire commissioner, and a public health officer,
                  but also a hospice. Most tellingly, in the first year's last
                  episode (available on DVD) the show's most determined opponent
                  of law, Al Swearingen, performs a community-endorsed mercy killing
                  that would make Clint Eastwood proud. And they do it all without
                  lawyers. Maybe there's a lesson there. <br>
