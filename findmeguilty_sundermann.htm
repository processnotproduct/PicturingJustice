                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Judge J. Howard Sundermann<br>
<br>
                  This film is about the longest trial in American history.  It
                  was the criminal trial of the Lucchese family of New Jersey,
                  there were twenty defendants and the trial lasted twenty-one
                  months.  There is no star studded cast; the lead is Vin Diesel,
                  known for stupid action films and even stupider comedies playing
                  off his tough guy persona.  But in the skilled hands of director
                  Sidney Lumet, he is terrific in this part.  Lumet has a distinguished
                  career including such courtroom classics as <i>12 Angry Men</i>
                  and <i>The Verdict</i>.  These films were a search for justice
                  and justice ultimately triumphs, in <i>Find Me Guilty</i> we
                  see the process but not any triumph of justice.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/findmeguilty.jpg" width="110" height="148" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Even though this
                  is a &quot;mob&quot; movie, there is only one brief scene of
                  violence at the beginning; almost all of the screen time is the
                  trial itself.  Much of the dialogue comes right from the transcript
                  of the trial.  The Diesel character plays one of the twenty defendants
                  and decides to defend himself pro se.  All of the other defendants
                  are represented, the smartest of the defense lawyers is a dwarf,
                  and a podium with stairs is tastefully wheeled out for him whenever
                  he addresses the jury. The other defense attorneys are presented
                  as generally indistinguishable from their disreputable clients.
                  The Diesel character is supposed to represent common sense and
                  getting to the heart of the matter rather than all the legalese
                  and complex testimony that took up most of the twenty-one months.
                  Diesel charms the jury in his cross-examination of witnesses
                  and tests the legal maxim that &quot;a laughing jury is not a
                  hanging jury.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  The Diesel character is not easy to root for.  He was clearly
                  a soldier for the mob, engaged in all manor of crimes and violence.
                   He is steadfastly loyal to his &quot;family&quot;, turning down
                  a plea bargain saying &quot;I don't rat on my friends.&quot;
                   His cousin shot him while he was in bed but Diesel refused to
                  identify his cousin as the shooter saying my eyes were closed
                  the whole time.  Are we supposed to admire this misplaced loyalty
                  and adherence to the code of Omerta?  All of the defendants,
                  including Diesel, seem clearly guilty of the charges, but we
                  as viewers are charmed and amused as well as the jury.  But will
                  this be enough to get a not guilty verdict; it will cost you
                  $8.00 to find out.<br>
<br>
                  The lead prosecutor is portrayed as an all too typical movie
                  prosecutor, arrogant and egotistical, ordering everyone around.
                   But he is competent and fanatic about getting a conviction in
                  this case.  Diesel's cross-examinations revel some latent anti-Italian
                  views on the part of some of the federal witnesses.  He asks
                  an FBI agent how he knew a group he observed were Italians, the
                  answer described black hair, loud talk and waving hands.  The
                  film exposes the needless complexity and length of such a trial
                  and the difficulty that our judicial and jury system have in
                  dealing with it.<br>
<br>
                  The judge is well played by Ron Silver; he tries his best to
                  keep things moving and to avoid a mistrial.  He is annoyed by
                  the Diesel character, but becomes more tolerant, even sympathetic,
                  as the trial proceeds.  The usual cinematic license is exercised
                  with the judge. There are numerous ex-parte conferences, one
                  with only the judge and Diesel, and the judge is shown to have
                  a full bar on display in chambers with the liquor in crystal
                  decanters.<br>
<br>
                  This film has its defects, but it is very good.  I'm afraid it
                  will not be in theaters long as it does not have much action
                  or sex, but the film is well worth seeing, Lumet has not lost
                  his courtroom touch.    <br>
