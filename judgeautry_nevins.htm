                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Francis M. Nevins<i></i></font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">GOLDTOWN GHOST RIDERS</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> (Columbia, 1952, directed by George
                  Archainbaud from a screenplay by Gerald Geraghty) was one of
                  the last features starring cowboy hero Gene Autry and the only
                  Western I've ever seen where the protagonist is a judge. Not
                  only is the story built around a legal gimmick but the hard-riding
                  straight-shooting hero gives a whole new meaning to judicial
                  activism. Circuit judge Autry happens to be present when Goldtown's
                  corrupt political boss (Carleton Young) is shot down on the street
                  by an ex-convict (Kirk Riley) recently released after serving
                  ten years for murder. Riley then claims that trying him for what
                  he just did would constitute double jeopardy, because Young is
                  the same man for whose murder he'd been convicted ten years before!<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/geneautry.jpg" width="102" height="136" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">This is a ploy today's law-trained
                  moviegoers are familiar with from <i>DOUBLE JEOPARDY</i> (1999),
                  in which the framed and imprisoned Ashley Judd got out and set
                  about tracking down her husband with the same intent as Kirk
                  Riley in GOLDTOWN and on the same nonsensical legal theory. I've
                  traced the gimmick as far back as the 1920s when English thriller
                  writer &quot;Seamark&quot; (Austin J. Small) used it in the short
                  story <i>Query</i> (collected in <i>OUT OF THE DARK</i>, Hodder
                  &amp; Stoughton 1931).<br>
<br>
                  When the story was reprinted in the US in the August 1948 issue
                  of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, it came to the attention
                  of a number of people in Hollywood who liked the legal gimmick
                  so much they appropriated it---without credit or payment to Austin
                  J. Small. The <i>Query</i> ploy served as the basis of <i>Double
                  Jeopardy</i> (1949), a 15-minute filmed episode of the TV anthology
                  series <i>FIRESIDE THEATER</i>, and a few years later was put
                  at the center of this Autry film. I'm sure it popped up on the
                  tube many more times before migrating to the big screen in the
                  Ashley Judd picture.<br>
<br>
                  Most of <i>GOLDTOWN GHOST RIDERS</i> consists of a long long
                  flashback <br>
                  describing how the characters got to where we saw them in the
                  first ten minutes. When asked to accept an appointment as circuit
                  judge, Autry first objects that he's a rancher with zero knowledge
                  of law, but agrees to serve after he's told that &quot;law's
                  just common sense.&quot; By the <br>
                  time the flashback is over we've learned that, after escaping
                  from Kirk <br>
                  Riley's death trap, Carleton Young came back to Goldtown and
                  took it <br>
                  over again, undisguised and unrecognized by Autry or anyone else
                  in the picture. Yeah, right. Finally we return to the present
                  as Riley in turn is shot down by Young's cronies, who themselves
                  are gunned down by the phantom riders of the title. This is hardly
                  a great movie or even a first-class shoot-em-up, but in any survey
                  of the cinematic frontier or the cinematic judiciary its corkscrew
                  plot, plus its juristic and supernatural overtones (both minimal)
                  and the easy-on-the-eyes desertscapes that were French-born director
                  Archainbaud's passion, entitle it to a moment in the (blazing)
                  sun.<br>
