                  THROUGH PRISM OF OUR MINDS</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It used to be a generation
                  was twenty years or so. The revival of the sixties decade has
                  taken nearly forty years to repeat. <i>Lord of the Rings</i>
                  was a book affected by wars then and became an appealing escape
                  into counterculture. Forty years later, it is a wildly successful
                  film trilogy, affected by a war on global terrorism, bringing
                  the past with it to a new incarnation of cultural phenomenon.
                  Infinite parallels can be made from <i>LOTR</i> to our socio-political
                  and economic spectrum. As a cinematic conceptualization, <i>LOTR</i>
                  is a psychic meeting point for synergistically related thoughts
                  of mythology, illusion, analogy, symbology, and technology which
                  help enforce our perception of the world.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">&quot;The world is changed&quot;
                  is the timeless light to our minds, shining through a mental
                  prism we create to interpret it. With all the rainbow spectrum
                  to influence us, we choose to beam forth our colored understandings.
                  This microcosm expands to the entire world based on the popularity
                  of these multi-faceted and multi-dimensional colorizations. We
                  can fragment any given light through any size prismatic subject
                  to shifting reflections. It has not changed the world. Only how
                  we adapt to it. <i>LOTR</i> taps into the psyche on a very personal
                  level. This source that lights our minds is important to know,
                  because its familiarity has become part of us. The prism of global
                  terror through the many lights of <i>LOTR</i> show our true colors.
                  How we interpret the prism of global terror will lead to annihilation
                  or world peace.</font></p>

                  might be swept off to.&quot;</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">

                  where you are going in the midst of crises around you is a universal
                  theme that cycles revivals of democracy and freedom for everyone.
                  A just system leads to just people. It is the duty of any democratic
                  government to respond to the will of the people, to be responsive,
                  to serve them. A government created and run by and for and of
                  the people must grow to include all the people of the world in
                  a world government.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">LOTR</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> exemplifies how this has always been done through
                  the life and strife of humankind, claiming through the senses
                  that &quot;The World is Changed,&quot; from peacetime to war
                  in the microcosm of the Shire because of the adventures of Bilbo
                  Baggins. A pattern revived when one goes after the power to rule
                  the world, war ensues from an alliance of those who would not
                  be ruled. History does repeat in a similar pattern, and in that
                  sense the world is not changed. <br>

                  Ring of Power as Inheritance</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Has it been forgotten how many
                  years of unsuccessful peaceful diplomacy have already passed?
                  Iraq despite changing regimes is still under UN sanctions. Aragorn
                  in the film wearies and disavows his heritage, as the sixties
                  generation had. But the void left remained empty of the promise
                  of utopian paradise for all the people of the world. There are
                  many parallels in the country freed and its turmoil to that of
                  Aragorn, the future king whose long ago relative kept the ring
                  for his beneficiaries.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Ring's succession to Gollum
                  (Schmiegal, the 500-year old Hobbitt) is ineffectual in wait
                  for its owner to reclaim it &quot;The ring has a will of its
                  own.&quot; Then it was captured for 60 years by Bilbo until he
                  left it and Bag-End to Frodo. In our real world schema it can
                  parallel the formation and sworn destruction of Israel, giving
                  it significance in its biblical proportions. Hatred and destruction
                  are themes that power responds to. The theme is detected only
                  by the aged wizard, Gandalf, who had previously defeated Mordor
                  (in the novel, The Hobbitt), who leads the charge against Mordor
                  this time.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the Islamic world, women
                  were first given inheritance as their legal right. It has been
                  taken away by Hussein and Bin Laden. Their identity has been
                  maligned. Gender has no direct sources in <i>LOTR</i>, but some
                  thought of women'' role in the present day should be made, since
                  it is a first that women in combat have become POWs. There are
                  no main female characters, but for elves. Hobbitt women are basically
                  homemakers, the princess of privilege in the Two Towers is an
                  anomaly. It is to the race of men to be strong and fight. <i>LOTR</i>
                  was made before Operation Enduring Freedom. The next incarnation
                  of <i>LOTR</i> may well be more suited to the present day foibles
                  and occupation of women as combatants, but not yet, and not here.<br>
<br>
                  <b>A Rush to Judgment</b></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But reel action? That is in
                  both films. <i>LOTR</i> has taken a stand and followed through.
                  Where is our will? We decry war for peace, meaning that the status
                  quo, however unsuccessful, won't succumb to leadership and actual
                  justice for 9/11/01 and the continuing threat of nuclear terrorist
                  violence. The Two Towers of Hussein and Bin Laden are evil aggressors
                  in the prism of global terror that the Muslim world has no solutions
                  for.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">They refuse peace. 9/11 began
                  the most recent change in our world. And wanting to get justice
                  for being attacked, the USA seeks out a way to get it: The War
                  on Global Terrorism. The theme moves to the real world and labels
                  this hatred and destruction. And we saw its ugly head reared
                  in the oppression of the Iraqis when Saddam (Sarumon) rebuilt
                  his army in the image of Bin Laden (Sauron's) 9/11 partial victory.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/lordrings2.jpg" width="150" height="217" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">All
                  should band with the USA and have only in principle. &quot;The
                  ring cannot stay here,&quot; Lord Elrond says about the ring
                  being brought to Rivendale. Real action is another matter entirely.
                  Frodo (representing the Iraqis, not lacking intelligence or drive,
                  but as Frodo lacking defensive resources) or Gandalf (the USA
                  and its alliance) stand alone. Now that more is known about what
                  is going on in both worlds, human nature goes into denial. The
                  one striking feature of the Global War on Terror is that THEY
                  WANT TO KILL US! We use our <i>LOTR</i> prism--view to defend
                  our stand. Others see their prism--view of us as aggressive,
                  occupying conquerors. Bin Laden and Hussein started this conflict.
                  Saruman and Sauron continually cause conflict to conquer for
                  themselves. It always has been the same conflict.<br>
<br>
                  <b>The United Nations and the Races of Middle Earth</b></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Elf Lord Elrond said &quot;The
                  race of man is failing....It should've ended that day but evil
                  was allowed to endure (In the Desert Storm the UN mandate did
                  not go far enough and left Hussein in power)..there's no strength
                  left in the world of men. They are scattered and divided, leaderless.
                  (The League of Nations disbanded due to lack of will, and the
                  UN not following through on its resolutions may end the same.)&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Ring of power is the threat
                  of terrorism wielded by ruthless murderers willing to do anything
                  by any means; wanting to go undetected until they choose the
                  time and place of conflict. Both cyber and nuclear weapons are
                  aimed at each government on Earth. New lights for the prism to
                  interpret. The fellowship that is breaking is allied unity due
                  to fear and greed (those countries doing business in Iraq that
                  may lose that revenue permanently in their depressed economies).
                  The fellowship breaks and the UN, even after Enduring Freedom
                  has not regained its credibility as a useful organization that
                  benefits its mandate of conflict resolution. Even the trees in
                  the film decide to fight, and take a side, something the UN has
                  yet to do. A lesson of justice we can learn from the film because
                  we have not seemed to have learned this lesson elsewhere.<br>

                  survivors of 9/11 and the newly freed Iraqis and what happened
                  to them was not their choice, but of individual survival to overcome
                  the hatred and destruction that they witnessed.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There was no hate so definite
                  as the bombing of the World Trade Center. Our methods and media
                  changed overnight, all try to capitalize on this great tragedy,
                  which should've been prevented during the last administration.
                  We paid create Hussein and Bin Laden (financial tracking for
                  evidence is irrefutable proof) who represent each destroyed tower
                  of the world trade center. Sarumon and Sauron, are the literary
                  twin axes of evil of singular purpose. The schizo, evil Gollum
                  as France, Germany, Russia supports Frodo because he wants the
                  ring back. Being near Frodo and Sam (Muslims and their energy
                  resources) other makes it appear possible, although he is torn,
                  by his own motives, stuck in his own way of life, different from
                  his own people, feeling betrayed the longer he connects with
                  others. Proof that being alone a long time can make you alone
                  even with help. Yet Gandalf  reappears to lift the burden from
                  Frodo, as promised in the Fellowship, the same way as the USA
                  got the unanimous lifting of sanctions of Iraq from the UN Security
                  Council, and relieved, both now relieved from each other's exclusion.

                  <b>Regime Change as an Unsafe Result</b></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Other countries will follow
                  this lead now that the &quot;nuclear floodgates&quot; have been
                  opened by the UN's lack of will. North Korea has. Pakistan and
                  India are making such overtures. We know that sanctions don't
                  work, but what has worked in many countries like Cambodia, Afghanistan,
                  Central and Eastern Europe, and in China, has been the creation
                  of the rule of civil and criminal law. Here is finally something
                  gone right, however indeliberate. Would the Chinese model work
                  in Iraq, too? And in other &quot;hotspots&quot; like Africa.
                  We should be in Africa. The prism rainbow loses its brilliant
                  spectrum when singularly focused on one color. We choose the
                  color or colors we view in our prism. We form prisms to protect
                  us from the unknown.<br>
<br>
                  Light is infinite, and from many sources. All of <i>LOTR</i>'s
                  elves have a halo of light around them, seemingly with no prisms
                  or spectral divisions to cloud them-- a na&iuml;ve light representing
                  internal existence. Because of this Queen Galadriel is called
                  the &quot;Lady of Light.&quot; Elves were solitary unto themselves,
                  and rarely collaborated with any other race. Queen Galadriel
                  was the bearer of one of the rings. Her ring, called Nenya ,
                  enabled the Mirror of Galadriel to see into the future and gave
                  her the vision to see Sauron's moves. It created a prism of Sauron
                  in her; an unnatural division in her being she was unable to
                  shatter, and she changed. For the elves, seeing a rainbow was
                  defeating in the sense that they needed to collaborate with the
                  other races. They came out but stopped, limited by their prisms.
                  <i>LOTR</i> never gets to the goal of a rainbow of light, the
                  full spectrum without having to form protective prisms. This
                  is why the elves sent much needed troops to help Rohan. It may
                  not be possible to exist without the prisms. All the races of
                  Middle Earth had a part in the creation of Sauron and Sarumon,
                  as all the countries of the UN had a part in creating Bin Laden
                  and Saddam Hussein. All have been touched by these evils. All
                  have made prisms to deal with them.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The UN should be its most active
                  in the enforcement of its mandates. It still hasn't done so and
                  this may lead to its own destruction. No will to defend positions
                  already taken, conditions must evolve again in a new perception
                  to keep the war on terror going, to be inclusive of all the races,
                  to see the entire spectrum. <br>
<br>
                  The creatures of Middle Earth band together to prevent further
                  darkness and destruction. Despite its potential and capabilities
                  to do so the UN hasn't. It is the broken fellowship that must
                  now rely on personal relations and associations to rebuild Iraq.
                  The UN's credibility and direction has been broken by the war
                  in Iraq. Having agreed to the War on Terrorism, it remains to
                  be seen that it will act there either.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The UN's refusal to face down
                  Hussein will leave a permanent scar on the UN's credibility.
                  From Bin Laden and Hussein came the collateral damage to the
                  UN. The collateral damage of Middle Earth is the elves retreating
                  prior to Mordor's attack. The inadvertent victims in LOTR are
                  more theoretical and environmental: the land will be in darkness
                  and destroyed by the industrialized economy of Mordor. With the
                  oil crisis also at stake, a case can be made for energy independence
                  by the USA as the inadvertent victim. The nine races of Middle
                  Earth took the magic rings and destroyed themselves in isolation
                  and surprise. The future of the UN is at stake. Bin Laden won't
                  ever step down willingly. How many more repeats? When &quot;fallen
                  out of memory,&quot; again, will we keep repeating ourselves
                  to a final destruction? This cycle is unchanged.</font></p>

                  <p><b><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">THE RETURN OF A KING?</font></i></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Middle East has long had
                  throned kingdoms. Saddam came to power as a dictator, though
                  it was clear he sought to establish a blood-line of rulers through
                  his sons. The purpose of Operation Enduring Freedom was to free
                  Iraq only from his regime. It remains to be seen if Iraq will
                  refuse democracy, but instead opt for a ruler or king like the
                  rest of its compatriots. We know the race of men in Middle Earth
                  seek a king to unite them again to glory...perhaps by the<br>
                  Christmas 2003 release of <i>LOTR</i>, Iraq and the rest of the
                  world will know itself better to decide whether they want more
                  war or peace and are willing to work at getting it.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It is far from over yet, and
                  Sauron and Sarumon are not the only evil to contend with. It
                  revolves in the same ways, and unbroken through new generations
                  the world will never change. New prisms to create, interpret
                  and follow. The fights in all of us will bloody the world, but
                  will never permanently replace the all too human urges to kill
                  and conquer at all expense. It is the same battle no matter where
                  it takes place, no matter whose prism defines it.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">LOTR</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> will remain timeless in both its appeal and
                  descriptions of human nature. Is the world truly changed? One
                  light can fragment in many ways. Perhaps the colors fragment
                  into what we want to see so much that we miss that there is one
                  source of the light, one light distorted through a prism we created.
                  The times set for <i>LOTR</i> and the War on Global Terror seem
                  to similarly motivate and influence humankind. The recent bombings
                  around the world demonstrate that the ring of power has taken
                  on human form. Must we always need some personified belief to
                  follow? Our prisms are not enough to show the world is changed.
                  It remains as it is.</font></p>
