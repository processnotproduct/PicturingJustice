    <font size="2"><p></font><font face="Verdana"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; A team of United States
    Marshals and Montgomery County (Maryland) Police officers executed a search warrant and
    entered the home of Charles and Geraldine Wilson in the early morning hours of April 16,
    1992. They intended to arrest Dominic Wilson, the son of Charles and Geraldine. Dominic
    had violated probation on prior felony charges of robbery, theft</small><img src="images/ussc.JPG" alt="ussc.JPG (11991 bytes)" align="right" hspace="12" vspace="12" width="202" height="175"><small> and assault with intent to rob.</small><p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles and Geraldine were sleeping when the officers entered their
    home. Charles ran into the living room to confront the officers and the police believing
    Charles to be Dominic subdued him while Geraldine watched in a bathrobe. After confirming
    Charles was not Dominic and conducting a protective sweep, the police left the house.</small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; This may sound like an ordinary execution of a search warrant.
    However, one vital fact must be mentioned: a reporter and a photographer from <i>The
    Washington Post</i> participated in the raid<i>.</i> The US Marshals invited the pair of
    reporters to accompany them as part of a regular media ride-along policy.</small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wilsons sued the US Marshals who executed the arrest warrant
    and the Montgomery County Sheriff&#146;s Department under (42 U.S.C. �1983) contending
    that the officers&#146; actions in bringing members of the media to observe and record the
    execution of the warrant violated their constitutional right to be &quot;&#133;secure in
    their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
    seizures.&quot; </small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 24, 1999, the United States Supreme Court agreed with the
    Wilsons, ruling it a violation of the Fourth Amendment to allow members of the media to
    accompany and record law enforcement officers during the execution of an arrest warrant in
    a private residence. <a href="http://lalabor.com/cases/privacy/lane_maj.html" target="_blank"><u>Wilson v. Layne, Deputy United States Marshal, et al.</u></a>,</small><font size="2"> 119 S.Ct. 1692 (1999)</font><small>. This was a particularly interesting case as
    it highlighted the inherent conflict between the First Amendment right to free press and
    Fourth Amendment&#146;s century old principles of respect for the privacy of the home. In
    the end the court ruled that the First Amendment does not grant reporters and
    photographers an absolute right to go anywhere at any time in pursuit of a story. The
    constitutional decision in this case, as authored by Chief Justice Rehnquist, to limit the
    scope of media &quot;ride-alongs&quot; is also important as it again sparked national
    debate on the boundaries and responsibilities of the media in our society. </small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; How will this Supreme Court decision affect our nations voyeuristic
    thirst for real-life crime drama, particularly as found in reality-based TV shows in the
    genre of <i>COPS</i>, <i>Stories of the HWY Patrol</i>, <i>Court TV</i> and others? While
    some of these programs, as this latest constitutional ruling suggests, may infringe on
    citizens&#146; right to privacy, we contend that these program nevertheless play an
    important role for our understanding of the legal system and law enforcement practices.
    Moreover, John Langley, the producer of <i>COPS</i>, contends that this ruling will have
    little impact on the format of his program.</small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that the media provides powerful and long-lasting
    images. In the United States, the publics&#146; understanding of the police role is in
    many ways directly correlated with Hollywood&#146;s latest crime movie or televisions
    latest cop-drama. Police scholar Egon Bittner appropriately observed a quarter century ago
    that while the police were one of the best know government institutions, they were one of
    the least understood. Clearly, the fictional images such as the calm, almost</small><img src="images/JACK_WEB.gif" alt="JACK_WEB.gif (24477 bytes)" align="right" hspace="12" vspace="12" width="142" height="210"><small> robot-like Sgt. Joe
    Friday to the renegade, unaccountable and lethal Dirty Harry have served to distort the
    public&#146;s perception of the true nature of policing.<a href="#1."><sup>1</sup></a>
    While part of the public&#146;s misperceptions of the police may be the unintended
    consequences of fictional characterizations, evidence also suggests that this lack of
    clarity results from the police themselves. Historically, corruption plagued the police
    institution for a variety of reasons. In response to this pervasive problem, the
    professional model was created by police visionaries such as O.W. Wilson and August
    Vollmer. The professional model of policing achieved wide acceptance as it had a number of
    benefits for law enforcement including independence, professionalism and crime control.
    Over time, however, this model fostered a culture were the public would eventually
    question the tactics and functions of the police in their communities. This evaluation
    also led to a general dissatisfaction and mistrust by many of the relationship between the
    police and the public.</small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Television programs popular during the professional era were
    indicative of this underlying law enforcement philosophy and they also served to </small><img src="images/adam-12sm-bw.JPG" alt="adam-12sm.JPG (18883 bytes)" align="left" hspace="12" vspace="1" width="143" height="208"><small>reinforce the
    public&#146;s perception of police culture. Television shows such as <i>Dragnet</i> and <i>Adam-12</i>
    portrayed officers as highly professional, detached crime fighters (the epitome of reform
    era policing that sought to &quot;get the facts, just the facts&quot;) and who always
    found the &quot;bad guys&quot;. Former Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker during an
    interview in 1962 said &quot;the television program <i>Dragnet</i> was one of the great
    instruments to give the people of the United States a picture of the policeman as he
    really is. It was most authentic. We participated in the editing of the scripts and in
    their filming. This program showed the true portrait of the policeman as a hard-working,
    selfless man, willing to go out and brave all sorts of hazards and working long hours to
    protect the community.&quot;<a href="#2."><sup>2</sup></a></small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Aware of their increased insulation from the public and a growing
    dissatisfaction with traditional, institutionalized patrol policies and rigid
    investigation procedures, law enforcement agencies throughout the United States began to
    dismantle the traditional professional model of policing in favor of more citizen friendly
    and prevention-based approaches. But these changes did not come easy or necessarily
    voluntary. Ironically, history has shown that the structured organizational controls and
    policies that were necessary to overcome the corruption and political influences
    characteristic of the spoils era, e.g., Eliot Ness and the <i>Untouchables,</i> were some
    of the same reasons for the failures of the police in the 1960s and 1970s. </small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; America was in the midst of reflection and sociopolitical turmoil
    in the 1960s and 1970s. It was during this cultural context that the police were
    responding to a baby boomer generation symbolized by recreational drug use and peaceful
    protests; a civil rights movement in search of basic and equal rights for racial
    minorities and women; and a society torn between patriotism and protest over the war in
    Vietnam. It became increasingly clear by the late 1960s that there existed a chasm between
    the professional model of police response and the public. Soon, trust in law enforcement
    was being replaced with a growing suspicion, frustration and anger. </small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Television, music and other forms of media at the time were a
    significant driving force that helped to escort change in law enforcement policy.
    Horrifying images of racial beatings in the South and violent responses of law enforcement
    to wartime protestors were regular images on the evening news. The music of Bob Dylan,
    Arlo Guthrie, and a long list of other artists were masters at turning folk lyrics into
    symbolic social commentary. The culmination of these events of the 1960s led to a
    Presidential inquiry and the now widely recited 1967 report of the President&#146;s
    Commission of Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. This report recommended many
    changes. Among the most notable and relevant to this discussion included: seeking
    increased communications between the police and community; increasing the responsiveness
    of the police to community concerns; fairly and objectively dealing with complaints
    against police officers; increasing the numbers of minorities in the ranks; creating
    mechanisms to facilitate increased citizen input to the police, and; facilitating
    community involvement on issues related to crime deterrence and apprehensions.</small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the specific strategies that have emerged over the last 20
    years to reduce the police-citizen gap have included community education campaigns, and
    community oriented policing and problem oriented policing. A third strategy, however, that
    is most relevant to this discussion, was the increased media/police collaboration and the
    presentation of real-life crime on prime time. Each of these strategies have been widely
    popular and successful at disseminating information and educating the public. They have
    also helped to increase police and citizen interactions and communication as well as
    decrease the mystery surrounding law enforcement. Nevertheless, as we now know, the
    Supreme Court has called into question the third leg of this tripod strategy, i.e., the
    boundaries of reality TV in policing.</small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The last decade has been witness to a growing number of reenactment</small><img src="images/amw-bw.JPG" alt="amw.JPG (14075 bytes)" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="12" width="107" height="128"><small> dramas and reality TV shows. Some
    of the most popular of the former include <i>Manhunter</i>, and <i>America&#146;s Most
    Wanted</i>, where crime scene reenactments are presented. Most recently, this type of
    television genre has given way to real life programming where video cameras are used to
    capture police work in action. Some of the more common of these reality programs include <i>Stories
    of the Highway Patrol</i>, and the widely popular program &quot;<i>COPS</i>.&quot; </small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 11, 1989, the FOX network premiered <i>COPS</i>, an
    American version of the very popular British Broadcasting Company&#146;s <i>Police</i>.<sup><a href="#3">3</a> </sup>The premise of the show is to follow police officers in the office,
    on stakeouts, on raids and to a lesser extent, at home. The series focused first on the
    members of the Broward County (Fla.) Sheriff&#146;s Department, then moved to other
    locations, mostly in the United States. <i>COPS</i> is a four time Emmy Award-nominated
    series and received the American Television Award in the category of Best Reality Show in
    1993. The success of the series, with its relatively low production costs, led to a
    proliferation of similar programs such as <i>American Detective</i>, <i>FBI: The Untold
    Stories</i>, <i>Stories of the Highway Patrol</i>, <i>Secret Service</i> and <i>True
    Detective</i> and others.</small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The authors of this paper suggest that reality TV, in addition to
    being merely entertaining, has helped to reduce the distance between the police and the
    public. Furthermore, these types of programs have given law enforcement in the United
    States an openness and accountability to the viewing public. Reality TV helps to ensure
    that the behaviors of the police are on target with society&#146;s values and norms. But,
    as quickly as reality-TV has gained in popularity, the high court has ruled that the media
    and police collaboration may have crossed over the boundaries of the constitution.</small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the historically symbiotic relationship between police and the
    makers of reality TV shows forever changed by the Court&#146;s unanimous decision? As
    stated earlier, the producer of <i>COPS</i>, John Langley, says it will be business as
    usual at his program. However, experts predict that shows like <i>COPS </i>will have to
    alter their practices. Prior to the ruling, production and camera crews would accompany
    police through an entire raid and then obtain releases or permission to use the footage.
    Now reality TV in order to go along with police inside a home would have to obtain
    permission from the homeowner prior to the raid which is unlikely since the element of
    surprise is vital to police.</small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The police/media collaboration was well intentioned but ultimately
    grew out of control resulting in the violation of the rights of people. Both the reality
    TV creators and police benefited from this relationship. The producers received real life
    drama that resulted in high ratings and high revenue from advertisements with little
    financial overhead needed for such shows. In addition, the police, by using this forum put
    their message out, received free publicity and demonstrated how intense crime fighting can
    be. </small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Supreme Court has put forth their opinion regarding media ride
    alongs and popular culture. It remains to be seen how this decision will impact popular
    shows like COPS that relied on those themes the court has outlawed. However, the court has
    laid down the challenge for the next generation of policing shows - to further the
    knowledge of policing without trampling upon constitutional safeguards. </small></p>
