                  LAW AND <i>MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET</i></font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Christine Corcos</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Santa Claus and law in the
                  movies might seem to be a strange pairing. Yet several films,
                  including <i>The Santa Clause</i> (a homeowner accidentally knocks
                  off the jolly old elf and then must fill in for him), <i>The
                  Night They Saved Christmas</i> (Santa becomes an environmentalist
                  fighting off a big oil company), and <i>A Different Kind of Christmas</i>
                  (a district attorney learns the true meaning of Christmas after
                  she accepts her father's preoccupation with being Santa) invoke
                  the law to make different points about love and kindness at this
                  particular time of year. Movies about Santa usually make the
                  point that belief in him requires faith; physical evidence is
                  usually not forthcoming, at least not on a wide scale. None presents
                  a more interesting picture of the power of faith and the limitations
                  of evidence than <i>Miracle on 34th Street</i>, first made in
                  1947 and since remade several times as a television movie and
                  as a musical.<br>
<br>
                  </font><img src="images/miracle34st.jpg" width="150" height="208" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Miracle</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">
                  juxtaposes statements of belief and statements of fact in an
                  attempt to demonstrate that certain kinds of disputes ought not
                  to be submitted to the court. In particular, disputes about belief
                  should not undergo judicial scrutiny. The film gives us the story
                  of Kris Kringle, an elderly man who believes that he is Santa
                  Claus, and the effect he has on the people around him, among
                  them Doris Walker, a Macy's employee disappointed in love, and
                  her cynical young daughter Susan, an up and coming New York lawyer,
                  Fred Gayley, the district attorney, Thomas Mara, and a New York
                  State Supreme Court judge, Henry X. Harper, soon to be up for
                  re-election. Pleased with his performance as the Macy Christmas
                  Parade's Santa, Doris hires Kris as the store Santa Claus. But
                  Kris' outrageous claims that he is Santa Claus concern her. As
                  she points out, &quot;all that has to happen is for a policeman
                  to ask him his name, and Clang! Clang! Bellevue!&quot; The store's
                  psychologist is convinced Kris is quite mad, and eventually finagles
                  a competency hearing. <br>
<br>
                  The courtroom scenes are among the most thoughtful and pointed
                  in the film, demonstrating that some issues are really not capable
                  of adjudication. When we subject them to legal analysis, we soon
                  discover the limitations of law. <br>
<br>
                  Kris' attorney and physician are sure he is not dangerous. Says
                  his doctor, &quot;Kris may be delusional, but it's a delusion
                  for good.&quot; Of course, this is quite true in the context
                  of the film, but it is not a defense in mental health law. Kris'
                  defense team must show not that he is delusional for good, but
                  that his delusions are not harmful. Attorney Fred Gayley, who
                  seems to be a corporate lawyer, is at a loss for a defense, especially
                  after Kris admits on the stand that he believes himself to be
                  Santa Claus, although his wits do not desert him. When the district
                  attorney asks him, &quot;Where do you live?&quot; he responds,
                  &quot;That's what this hearing will decide,&quot; much to the
                  amusement of the court. As the hearing progresses, the District
                  Attorney demands that the court consider the question of whether
                  Santa actually exists. Judge Harper takes a short recess to confer
                  with his campaign manager, Charles Halloran. How can he really
                  take judicial notice of the existence of Santa? he asks Halloran.
                  &quot;Ok,&quot; the campaign manager replies, &quot;Rule that
                  Santa doesn't exist.&quot; The result? Children won't hang up
                  their stockings, parents won't buy toys, toy manufacturers will
                  go out of business and their employees will be unemployed. And
                  those employees vote. When that happens, says Halloran, &quot;you
                  can count on just two votes [in your re-election campaign]...yours
                  and that district attorney's out there.&quot; &quot;No,&quot;
                  Judge Harper says sadly, &quot;the district attorney's a Republican.&quot;
                  Faced with the grim realities that dog an elected judge, he returns
                  to his courtroom and announces that &quot;the court will keep
                  an open mind&quot; on the existence of Santa Claus, a Solomonic
                  decision that meets with Halloran's approval. Exclaims an astounded
                  district attorney, &quot;He's crazy too!&quot; He then leaps
                  up and demands that Gayley demonstrate to the satisfaction of
                  the court that Kris is &quot;the one, the ONLY Santa Claus.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  Gayley aceepts the challenge although he has no real method in
                  mind for proving Kris' identity. Finally he hits on the idea
                  of presenting opinion testimony, and calls small Thomas Mara,
                  Jr. to the stand. The judge asks the boy if he knows the difference
                  between a truth and a lie before allowing him to testify. &quot;Gosh,
                  everybody knows you shouldn't tell a lie, especially in court,&quot;
                  replies Tommy forthrightly. &quot;How do you know Santa exists?&quot;
                  asks Gayley, pursuant to present rule 704.. &quot;My daddy told
                  me so,&quot; says little Thomas, &quot;and he wouldn't tell me
                  a lie. Would you, Daddy?&quot; The embarrassed D.A. acknowledges
                  that no, he is not in the habit of lying to his son. Pursuant
                  to FRE 602, Gayley also calls R. H. Macy and asks him if he believes
                  that Kris Kringle is the &quot;real&quot; Santa Claus. Macy,
                  reviewing the very positive effects that Santa has had on his
                  employees' and customers' mood and his own bottom line, replies
                  that yes, indeed, he does so believe.<br>
<br>
                  In spite of this opinion testimony, things go from bad to worse
                  for the defense. The district attorney is both alarmed and amused
                  by this tactic. He continues to insist that the burden is on
                  the defense to show that Kringle is not mad, and the only way
                  to do that is to show that he is the real article. Gayley has
                  no evidence to support that contention and reluctantly concludes
                  that the case is lost. At this point, magical intervention in
                  the form of some U. S. Post Office employees, intervenes. Faced
                  with heavy bags of mail addressed to &quot;Santa Claus, The North
                  Pole&quot; and not wishing to send it all to the Dead Letter
                  Office, the employees decide sua sponte to send all this mail
                  to the courthouse where Kringle's sanity hearing is underway.
<br>
                  In the &quot;nick&quot; of time, these bags arrive in the courtroom.
                  An ecstatic Gayley urges the judge to accept them as evidence
                  that A&quot;he U. S. Post Office, an official arm of the U. S.
                  Government, recognizes Kris Kringle as the one, the only Santa
                  Claus.&quot; Banging his gavel, the judge opines, &quot;Since
                  the U. S. Government has seen fit to recognize Mr. Kringle as
                  Santa Claus, this court will not dispute it. Case dismissed.&quot;
                  Everyone then disperses to carry out his or her holiday plans.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Miracle on 34th Street</i> poses some interesting questions
                  about the ability of courts to intervene in disputes that are
                  matters of faith, a question that they wrestle with frequently,
                  though rarely with such elegance and so happy an ending. In addition,
                  it presents us with a man who is delusional only if, as his attorney
                  points out, he believes wrongly that he is Santa Claus. As he
                  says to the judge (paraphrased), &quot;You believe you are Judge
                  Harper, yet no one suggests that you are crazy. Why? Because
                  you are Judge Harper.&quot; Much of our identity, he suggests,
                  is bound up in what we believe about ourselves and how much in
                  what others believe about us, a theme that we see repeated in
                  the works of Kafka and in movies like <i>The Net</i>. When does
                  fantasy become reality and belief become truth?<br>
<br>
                  Has a court ever ruled on the existence of Santa? Not exactly.
                  But in December 2000 an Ohio probate court ruled against a petitioner
                  wishing to change his name to Santa Claus, saying that &quot;The
                  history of Santa Claus -- the North Pole, the elves, Mrs. Claus,
                  reindeer -- is a treasure that society passes on from generation
                  to generation, and the petitioner seeks to take not only the
                  name of Santa Claus, but also to take the identity of Santa Claus.
                  Although thousands of people every year do take on the identity
                  of Santa Claus around Christmas, the court believes it would
                  be very misleading to the children in the community, particularly
                  the children in the area that the petitioner lives, to approve
                  the applicant's name change petition. Therefore, for the foregoing
                  reasons, the court finds that it would be against public policy
                  to grant the application of the petitioner.&quot; <br>
