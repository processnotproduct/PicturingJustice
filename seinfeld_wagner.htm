                  by Kenneth Wagner</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In recent decades, television
                  programming has been handling topics that were at one time almost
                  unthinkable. Shows have dealt with issues such as racism, homophobia,
                  same sex marriage, and interracial relationships. One topic that
                  seems off limits however, is that of abortion. As Rachel Fudge
                  points out in an article in Clamor magazine: &quot;As many commentators
                  have pointed out, as all of the old you-can't-do-that-on-television
                  taboos - sexual content, violence, cursing, nudity, homosexuality
                  - have fallen away, abortion is the one hot-button issue that
                  simply remains too hot for TV.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/seinfeld.jpg" width="146" height="110" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Interestingly
                  enough one recent television program that bucked this avoidance
                  was the wildly popular, irreverent sit-com <i>Seinfeld</i> in
                  the episode titled '<i>The Couch</i>.' In this episode, main
                  character Jerry and his friend Elaine go to a restaurant. At
                  the restaurant Elaine claims that she refuses to eat pizza from
                  a certain national pizza chain because &quot;the owner contributes
                  a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.&quot;
                  Jerry is in disbelief, and asks her if she would eat at the present
                  business if it had the same leanings. Upon asking the owner,
                  &quot;Poppie,&quot; his views and finding him against abortion,
                  she demands they leave the establishment. Later, Elaine begins
                  a relationship with a mover she saw at Jerry's apartment, but
                  must break with him too when she finds that he is pro-life.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In a biting satire of the controversy,
                  Poppie and Jerry's neighbor Kramer have a falling out that leads
                  to a dissolving of a business partnership when they disagree
                  about what toppings belong on a pizza. Poppie, symbolizing the
                  pro-life stance, declares &quot;but we cannot give the people
                  the right to choose any topping they want&quot; while Kramer
                  emphatically states, &quot;What gives you the right to tell me
                  how I would make my pie?&quot; Mocking the philosophical arguments
                  engaged in over the rights of the fetus Kramer claims, &quot;It's
                  not a pizza until it comes out of the oven&quot;, while Poppie
                  holds &quot;It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the
                  dough!&quot; Thus ends their partnership.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This episode brings up a major
                  point of interest to legal scholars and philosophical ethicists.
                  Many hold that matters of ethics are objective matters, that
                  they are akin to saying that person A is taller than person B
                  is, or that one comet moves faster than another does. Those who
                  cannot or will not see such objective facts about the world are
                  either mistaken or evil. The philosopher Immanuel Kant thought
                  something like this, seeking to ground his ethics in 'categorical
                  imperatives' grounded in reason. For example, any reasonable
                  person could see that the ethical imperative &quot;Lying is right&quot;
                  must be incorrect (and its negation correct) since if applied
                  categorically the imperative cannot even be stated (if lying
                  is right, then one should lie and not say it is right)!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">On the other hand, many philosophers
                  believe that ethics are more like matters of taste than like
                  matters of fact. David Hume for example thought we projected
                  ethical properties (such as &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;right&quot;)
                  onto the world. This is called projectivism. Reason has a small
                  role to play in these matters, but essentially, it is akin to
                  arguing over which picture is more pleasing or what soda tastes
                  better. As he put it in his famous quote, &quot;Reason is and
                  ought to be the slave to the passions.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Like most ethical arguments,
                  these stances find footing in legal debates. Many who think that
                  ethical matters are objective matters find a home in the growing
                  natural law movement. Later thinkers such as Aristotle and Aquinas
                  first put forward natural law ideas, reasoning that the nature
                  of human beings and therefore right and wrong (which spring from
                  our nature) is a matter discernible by reason. Later day natural
                  law proponent Robert George puts it this way &quot;In his formal
                  account of natural law as a participation in what he called the
                  'eternal law,' Aquinas says that although God directs brute animals
                  to their proper ends by instinct, God directs man--made in God's
                  image and likeness and thus possessing reason and freedom--to
                  his proper ends by practical reason through which men grasp the
                  intelligible point of certain possible actions for the sake of
                  ends (goods, values, purposes) which, <i>qua</i> intelligible,
                  provide reasons for choice and action&quot; (Remarks to the 1998
                  American Political Science Association) . Of course, many pro-choice
                  theorists also lay claim to natural law (see for example Ronald
                  Dworkin <i>Life's Dominion</i>; Alfred A. Knopf, 1993). The point
                  for this essay is that they see the matter as one of reason and
                  facts.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A different legal philosophy
                  lies in the positivism of John Austin. Austin argues that laws
                  are not anchored in nature, but are commands of the sovereign.
                  A legal positivist would note the argument made by Justice Harry
                  Blackmun in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> that there is no right to life
                  in the U.S. Constitution for 'persons unborn' since the document
                  (in the 14th Amendment) grants rights only to citizens 'born'
                  in the nation. The positive law, not an abstract, discernible
                  'law of nature' decides the case.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After reviewing these ivory
                  tower academic and law school theories on the issue of abortion,
                  the nature of law and ethics it is easy to see where the episode
                  of <i>Seinfeld</i> stands. Clearly, the tone is one of mocking
                  those who, like Elaine and her boyfriend, see ethics as an objective
                  matter. Their commitment to their abstract position is seen as
                  dooming their happiness in this concrete and immediate relationship.
                  This is satirized perfectly by the parallel situation between
                  Kramer and Poppy, whose partnership is ruined when they each
                  take absolutist positions on what is clearly a matter of taste
                  (how a pizza should be prepared). Meanwhile Jerry, the stand
                  up comedian, plays David Hume, marveling that folk would confuse
                  reality with their own projections on it and that they let matters
                  of taste ruin real friendships and social ties. As Hume has been
                  referred to as a philosophical practical joker this seems a very
                  fitting symbolism.<br>
