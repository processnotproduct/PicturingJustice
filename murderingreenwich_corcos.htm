<br>
                  The latest in an unending series of docudramas (&quot;cases ripped
                  from today's headlines&quot;) is <i>Dominick Dunne Presents</i>
                  <i>Murder in Greenwich</i>, a dramatization of Mark Fuhrman's
                  (yes, THAT Mark Fuhrman's) reconstruction of the death of Martha
                  Elizabeth Moxley on October 30, 1975. Fuhrman, who became infamous
                  through the real life televising of the trial of O. J. Simpson,
                  faded from sight after his conviction for perjured testimony
                  during that trial, moved to Idaho and eventually wrote a book
                  about the case, <i>Murder in Brentwood</i>, which became a best-seller
                  (though not a tv movie). Re-inventing himself as a kind of private
                  investigator-cum-true crime writer, Fuhrman (who tells us in
                  <i>Murder in Greenwich</i> that he &quot;never stopped being
                  a detective&quot;) decided to re-open the decades old unsolved
                  murder of a pretty Connecticut teenager, the neighbor of Kennedy
                  in-laws.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Murder in Greenwich</i> should have been Martha's movie. Certainly
                  the filmmakers try to make her the center of attention, by using
                  that hokey old method of presenting her as the narrator of her
                  own tragedy. The actress who plays Martha is cute enough, and
                  certainly resembles Martha, but in these scenes she seems like
                  an older woman trying to play a coy teenager, a jarring addition
                  and one that was certainly not needed. In addition, we are treated
                  to swooping camera work over the crime scene and through various
                  houses as people discuss the murder. The implication is that
                  Martha is an angel, or an otherworldly spirit leading us to the
                  truth about her murder. Was this a concession to the family's
                  firmly held Catholic faith? It's possible, but it is also possible
                  that the writers simply took this opportunity to increase the
                  pathos of the story.<br>
<br>
                  The film introduces some serious issues, mainly the miscarriage
                  of justice so long ago. The question of whether the rich are
                  different enough to consistently buy immunity from prosecution
                  is an abiding one. Fuhrman's arrival on the scene with requests
                  to interview witnesses and examine documents stirs up old antagonisms
                  and fears, causing one police officer to remind him that the
                  case &quot;is still open.&quot; Some of the residents remind
                  him that he is a convicted perjurer, a comment which he takes
                  like a man. Our hero Fuhrman barrels through the wealthy and
                  cloistered town of Greenwich demanding that its inhabitants search
                  their souls for the truth about Martha's murder. At the same
                  time, he makes loud and obvious comparisons to the deaths of
                  Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, telling one former detective
                  who worked the Moxley case that he &quot;let a double murderer
                  get away&quot; because he lied on the stand. &quot;I didn't want
                  it to be about me,&quot; he asserts. His new found friend consoles
                  him that it ended up &quot;being about you, anyway.&quot; Ah,
                  shucks.<br>
<br>
                  Ultimately what is indigestible about <i>Murder in Greenwich</i>
                  is its presentation of Fuhrman as the savior the town needs to
                  face up to its past, salvage its present and redeem its future.
                  Even if the O.J. trial was not really &quot;all about Mark Fuhrman&quot;,
                  this movie certainly is. Undoubtedly there was little choice;
                  the film is, after all, based on Fuhrman's book. The very real
                  questions about the lack of energy with which the Greenwich police
                  investigated Martha's murder are disposed of with the assumption
                  that the police were honest but the Skakels and their friends
                  (including the police commissioner) ran the town in 1975 and
                  continued to run the town until the day Mark Fuhrman arrived.
                  Like a gunslinger of the Old West he makes his opinions known,
                  managing to insult the very former detective whose assistance
                  he will need later. But Mark knows how to apologize when he is
                  in the wrong, and he manages through force of personality and
                  rightness of cause to get the information and the interviews
                  he needs. Mark is incredibly attractive too; he gets the come-on
                  from an attractive but alcoholic socialite who helps him by getting
                  him, the lower class, discredited out of towner, into contact
                  with the wealthy and diffident villagers. Before he leaves town,
                  he eventually takes her to task for her excessive drinking in
                  the mornings, without accepting her obvious invitation to distract
                  her at night. Good man, that Mark Fuhrman, and a loyal husband.
                  Magically he overcomes all obstacles. Against all odds, he solves
                  Martha's murder.<br>
<br>
                  Fuhrman and his sidekick, a young and educated type who seems
                  more at home in Greenwich than he does, eventually construct
                  a plausible explanation for Martha's seeming disappearance after
                  9:30 on October 30 and the slippery time of her death: was it
                  9:50, 10:30 or later? As Fuhrman points out, and this is an important
                  issue to keep in mind, the police who investigated the murder
                  originally tried to determine the time of the murder from the
                  times during which their prime suspects had an alibi. Since the
                  Skakel boys seemed to be accounted for after 9:30 and the initial
                  coroner's report and earwitnesses suggested Martha died before
                  10, the police were stumped. Rushton Skakel's willingness to
                  allow them to search the Skakel house was another psychological
                  red herring. The police could not believe that anyone who consented
                  to a search might know anything about the murder (and the film
                  does not suggest that the elder Skakel in fact did know anything).<br>
<br>
                  What Fuhrman does contribute is a lesson in deduction. As he
                  points out, barking dog evidence, which the police took to be
                  contemporaneous with the crime, is not proof of anything. Of
                  course, the famous barking dog in the Nicole Simpson/Ronald Goldman
                  case set the time of those deaths (but that is another story).
                  Instead, Fuhrman and his colleagues set out to reconstruct the
                  murder. They have no choice. They have no formal investigative
                  power. Much of the evidence is either secret, mishandled, or
                  lost. The film attributes this not to sloppy police work (that
                  would be too reminiscent of the O.J. case) but to undue influence
                  and deliberate tampering in order to hide evidence of guilt.
                  The legal system has failed Martha for 25 years, but Fuhrman
                  will do her justice.<br>
<br>
                  Thus does anti-hero detective Mark Fuhrman, who became a familiar
                  face through a televised real trial dealing with a real-life
                  double murder, reinvent himself as hero private detective Mark
                  Fuhrman, avenger of the innocent, in this fictionalized television
                  version. The actor who plays Fuhrman is attractive. He plays
                  the detective with a touching macho sensitivity, leaving flowers
                  at Martha's grave, meeting with Martha's mother to assure her
                  that she did not hear her daughter's death agony at 9:30 that
                  night, and looking on with quiet approval as Dorthy Moxley quietly
                  celebrates the end of a nightmare on the steps of the courthouse.<br>
<br>
                  The film seems to take at least some liberties with the story
                  as it has evolved in the press and in court. One of the other
                  prime suspects, Ken Littleton, the Skakel boys' tutor, becomes
                  someone named &quot;Morris&quot;, perhaps to defend against a
                  potential defamation suit. The suggestion that Fuhrman single-handedly
                  focused enough attention on the crime to re-open the investigation
                  would come as a surprise to Timothy Dumas, a resident of Greenwich
                  at the time of the murder, who has since written his own version,
                  <i>A Wealth of Evil</i> (1998), well written and thoughtful,
                  and to Dominick Dunne himself, whose fictionalization of the
                  story appeared in his 1993 novel <i>A Season in Purgatory</i>.
<br>
<br>
                  In spite of the attention that the movie gives to Martha's last
                  weeks and the speculations surrounding her death, it uses her
                  as much as anyone else in this sordid story, except her family.
                  It explains this sad, perverse tale of a would-be Romeo and Juliet
                  ends as the killing of Juliet by her unknown Romeo, with the
                  entire town closing ranks against the accusation of a murderer
                  among them. Martha's life was not nearly as important as her
                  killer's, says <i>Murder in Greenwich</i>. The town sacrificed
                  her to its peace of mind. The film, and Fuhrman, may be correct
                  in their analysis. But Fuhrman surely uses Martha to rehabilitate
                  himself. The film presents him as the smartest, the most dogged,
                  the most incorruptible investigator ever to hit town. But he
                  is not the only person who seems to use Martha for his own ends.<br>
<br>
                  Even Dominick Dunne, who has known the tragic loss of a daughter
                  inserts himself into this story; the title of the movie is <i>Dominick
                  Dunne Presents Murder in Greenwich</i>. Using a 15 year old murder
                  victim in this way makes this film ultimately quite unpalatable,
                  even if it were well written, well acted and well intentioned.
                  It may be the last of these three, but it still does Martha a
                  disservice. The movie compresses the actual trial-the vindication
                  that we are led to believe is the purpose of the exercise-into
                  a few minutes. After all the speculation about the absence of
                  justice for more than two decades, we do not see how justice
                  is finally achieved.<br>
<br>
                  At the conclusion of the trial, Dorthy Moxley addresses the crush
                  of journalists crowded around to hear her reaction to the guilty
                  verdict. &quot;This is Martha's day,&quot; she assures them.
                  It should have been. Martha Moxley, who was pretty and funny
                  and eager to enter into young adulthood, had so few days to call
                  her own. <i>Murder in Greenwich</i> tries to give us a sense
                  of the reasons for Martha's short stay on earth, and of the meaninglessness
                  of her sudden and violent death. It tries as well to give us
                  some understanding of the motivations of a lonely and troubled
                  boy, who 27 years later was convicted of the murder. To some
                  extent it succeeds, in spite of the trite dialogue, the false
                  drama and the intrusive presence of media celebrities Dominick
                  Dunne, who &quot;presents Murder in Greenwich&quot; according
                  to the film's title, and Fuhrman himself. But the presence of
                  those celebrities is just a reconfirmation of Martha's ultimate
                  meaning to others: Dunne and Fuhrman have used her, just as the
                  film suggests Tommy Skakel used her during that last summer of
                  her life.<br>
<br>
                  She deserves better than that. <i>Murder in Greenwich</i> is
                  Mark Fuhrman's movie. It should have been Martha's.</font></p>
