                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Taunya Lovell Banks, University
                  of Maryland</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In this season's opener of
                  <i>The Practice</i>, the Boston-based law firm headed by Robert
                  &quot;Bobby&quot; G. Donnell (Dylan McDermott) continues to struggle
                  with the ethics of law practice. Ethical breaches on episodes
                  of <i>The Practice</i> provide law teachers with ample examples
                  of bad or unethical lawyering. The season's first episode, entitled
                  <i>The Candidate</i>, centers around Ellenor Frutt's (Camryn
                  Manheim ) representation of a friend, a well regarded Senator,
                  charged with murder. She also represents his wife and daughter,
                  witnesses to the murder.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The ethical problems with representing
                  multiple potential suspects, any one of whom might be responsible
                  for the murder, are readily apparent to even the most naive viewer
                  of lawyer shows. Rather than recite the litany of ethical breaches
                  that occur in this episode, a record number even for <i>The Practice</i>,
                  I want to focus on one particularly essential component of good
                  lawyering, trust. A lawyer must have trust in the legal system,
                  colleagues and clients. In turn, the lawyer must engender trust
                  in colleagues and clients. In this episode Ellenor proves herself
                  untrustworthy in every respect.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It is essential that a client
                  trust her lawyer so that the client will be forthcoming with
                  the lawyer. Trust is particularly important if the lawyer is
                  to fulfill her role as counselor. The lawyer as counselor helps
                  the client make crucial decisions over the life of the case.
                  Without all the information a client has to offer, the lawyer-counselor
                  cannot help her client make informed choices. The lawyer-advocate
                  also is severely handicap in preparing a defense. Yet, from the
                  beginning, Ellenor signals her client, Senator Keith Ellison,
                  that she cannot be trusted.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After being summoned to the
                  Senator's house and shown the murder scene, Ellenor tells the
                  Senator not to say anything that will prevent her from representing
                  him. Given this initial warning that she can not be trusted with
                  the truth, why would the Senator be forthcoming with the truth?
                  Unsurprisingly, the Senator responds, &quot;if knowing the truth
                  would prevent you from representing me, you're not getting it.&quot;
                  He continues, saying that Ellenor must decide how much information
                  she wants from him.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A good lawyer might reply that
                  knowing the whole truth will help the lawyer to prepare an effective
                  defense. Even a guilty person is entitled to demand that the
                  prosecution prove its case. Ellenor appears to misconstrue the
                  lawyer's obligation. A good defense lawyer would make the state
                  prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt while preserving her
                  client's constitutional right against self- incrimination. Instead,
                  Ellenor tells the Senator to wash the blood spots off his naked
                  body, serious misconduct on her part.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By encouraging the Senator
                  to destroy evidence, Ellenor may have committed a felony, obstruction
                  of justice. It is one thing for a lawyer to advise a client on
                  how to avoid conviction, but quite another to give advice on
                  how to avoid detection. This is not quite the same as the classic
                  case of <i>In Re Ryder</i> where the lawyer took possession of
                  the weapon, but close enough.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Despite their friendship, there
                  is no lawyer-client trust between Ellenor and Senator Ellison
                  because Ellenor does not want to know the truth. She also is
                  unwilling to tell her partners the truth. She lies to Bobby saying
                  that the Senator came up with the idea of washing off the blood
                  spots. Bobby strongly suspects that Ellenor is lying to him about
                  her commission of not only an ethical breach, but a criminal
                  offense. Bobby, no paragon of ethical virtue, is really concerned
                  that Ellenor may have broken the law, not the canons of ethics.
                  Despite these limitations, the entire firm takes on the case.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Ellenor and her partners end
                  up lawyering in the dark, a problem that plagues their defense
                  of Senator Ellison throughout the show. Worried about his political
                  career, the Senator consistently refuses to tell his lawyers
                  what happens and actually misleads them. The witness clients,
                  the wife and daughter, also lie to the firm lawyers. Not knowing
                  the truth leads to the surprise ending. Perhaps this is dramatic
                  license, but it conveys a potentially dangerous message to the
                  viewing audience - truth is not a necessary corollary to justice.
                  Further, as is the case with too many episodes of <i>The Practice</i>,
                  the lawyers engage in bad lawyering without suffering any personal
                  adverse consequences. It's time to revoke their bar cards.</font></p>
