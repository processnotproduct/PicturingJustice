                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Judge J. Howard Sundermann<br>
                  </font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">North Country</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is about the first class action lawsuit
                  ever filed for sexual harassment.  Courtroom scenes are shown
                  briefly at the beginning, and the film ends in a court hearing,
                  but most of the screen time is about the events leading up to
                  the suit.  The film is loosely based on real events and a book
                  that was written about the entire situation, but is not by any
                  means a docu-drama, the details are fiction.  The film is made
                  in the tradition of <i>Silkwood</i> and <i>Norma Rae</i>, but
                  unlike <i>Norma Rae</i>, there is already a union and they are
                  one of the bad guys.<br>
                   <br>
                  <img src="images/north country.jpg" width="103" height="149" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The lead character,
                  Josie, leaves an abusive relationship and goes home to Northern
                  Minnesota with her two children.  The only job that pays decent
                  money there is in the mines where her father works.  She gets
                  a job at the mine and connects with the few other women fellow
                  employees. Their bosses and the men who work at the mine are
                  hostile and clearly do not want women working there.  The harassment
                  portrayed that Josie and the other woman receive is brutal and
                  graphic, everyone seems to be in on it. Even those who do not
                  participate tolerate it, laugh at the crude jokes, and certainly
                  would back their fellow workers if accusations were made.<br>
<br>
                  Josie goes to her bosses to complain but does not even get a
                  hearing.  She is told to come back when you have a real problem.
                   She also cannot convince her fellow woman workers to join her
                  in a complaint as they say they need the job and would rather
                  put up with the deplorable conditions than get fired.  As a last
                  resort she goes to a local lawyer who is at first reluctant to
                  help, but finally agrees because the suit is the first of its
                  kind. <br>
                   <br>
                  The film graphically portrays the difficulties woman encounter
                  in trying to achieve equal status when they go into jobs that
                  have traditionally been exclusively male.  Josie is told she
                  is taking a job away from a man who needs it to support his family;
                  she replies that she needs it for the same reason.  The story
                  is told totally from Josie's point of view; almost everyone else
                  depicted is evil.<br>
                    <br>
                  The film is very well done; it is gripping and extremely well
                  acted.  Charlize Theron plays Josie.  She showed in <i>Monster</i>
                  that she is not just another pretty face and can act, and delivers
                  another terrific performance here.  She is the underdog against
                  the large corporation and her fellow male workers.  Her father's
                  character is particularly well performed.  He works in the mine
                  and has the same mind set as his fellow male workers about women's
                  place in the mine, but he sees what is happening to his daughter
                  and is caught in the middle.  His speech in the union hall where
                  he finally resolves his conflict is one of the dramatic highlights
                  of the film.<br>
<br>
                  The film does, in my view, have three flaws.  First, the harassment
                  seems a bit over the top.  Every male minor is shown to be a
                  grinning moron, who spends most of his time planning the next
                  disgusting thing to do to the woman workers.  The second problem
                  is the court room scenes.  I know that filmmakers are not there
                  to conduct law classes but to dramatize and entertain, but these
                  scenes take that to the limit.  The film's legal advisor was
                  either asleep, underpaid or ignored.  The latitude allowed as
                  to the sexual history of the witnesses is beyond belief.  Lawyers
                  continue to question a witness after several warnings to stop,
                  and when the answer is badgered out of them, there is no objection
                  and the testimony is admitted.  Speeches are made rather than
                  questions asked, and the &quot;big dramatic moment&quot; where
                  people stand up for Josie is a bit far fetched.  But, I have
                  to admit, the scenes do work as film entertainment.  Please leave
                  your &quot;Wigmore on Evidence&quot; home when you go.  The third
                  problem is the heavy-handed political message.  As the film shows
                  terrible sexual harassment, we are shown in the background several
                  times the televised Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill hearings.
                   Clearly the message is that we should believe Hill.  It seems
                  to say that if any harassment is going on anywhere; then we must
                  then believe any such charge made no matter what the motive or
                  how unsubstantiated the evidence.  But, with these asides, it
                  is a film worth seeing.   <br>
