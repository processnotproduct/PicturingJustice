                  by Rob Waring</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The film <i>Changing Lanes</i>
                  deals with a frequent source of ethical tension in the cinema
                  by revisiting the question: Can salvation be attained by good
                  works? This age old quandary provided much fuel for the Protestant
                  Reformation centuries ago, and remains a box office draw today.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/changinglanes4.jpg" width="194" height="132" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In
                  the film, Ben Affleck plays Gavin Banek, a young lawyer who is
                  just about to leave his idealism behind as he motors down the
                  expressway of corporate law. He works at big law firm headed
                  by his father in law Stephen Delano, played by Sydney Pollack,
                  last seen in<i> Eyes Wide Shut</i>, in another of his evil insider
                  roles. An accident brings out the worst in Banek's character
                  , as he stops at nothing to win a case that he does not believe
                  in. His firm's attempt to cover his mistakes forces him to confront
                  the firm's illegal and unethical tactics, which include forgery
                  and filing false documents.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In a memorable speech to Banek,
                  his father in law berates him, urging him to drop his idealistic
                  pretense and play the game as unethically as everyone else. Delano
                  reminds him that nearly every philanthropic attempt to do good
                  is paid for by companies or individuals who have exploited the
                  weak. Control of a charitable foundation is at stake, and Delano
                  ticks off a list of environmental and labor crimes that funded
                  it. If Banek will just play along, like Delano, he'll have power,
                  money and the pretense of respectability. He can even do probono
                  work to erase the stain of the law firm's fraud. If he does not
                  cooperate and instead reports the fraud he has discovered, it
                  could bring down their entire firm and his marriage to Delano's
                  daughter.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The plot thus presents the
                  generally accepted method of attaining respectability (the modern
                  version of salvation). In short, do good works to balance your
                  immoral conduct, but above all, don't get caught in your bad
                  deeds. Too much publicity about evil conduct can erase the protection
                  brought by good works.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Recently, The New York Times
                  published a special report, in conjunction with the Canadian
                  Broadcasting Corporation and PBS's <i>Frontline</i>, on McWane
                  Inc., an Alabama based manufacturer of cast iron pipe. If the
                  New York Times is to be believe, McWane has one of the worst
                  environmental and worker safety records of any U.S. Corporation.
                  The company appears to follow Delano's credo, and puts extraordinary
                  effort into not getting caught B staying one step ahead of the
                  law. In addition, the family owned business has given millions
                  to Alabama charities. As a result, many Alabamians have a favorable
                  view of McWane for its generosity, and know nothing of its reckless
                  indifference to human life. It will be interesting to see if
                  the report has any effect on McWane's fortunes.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Perhaps there ought to be an
                  absolute level of evil that can never be outweighed by good deeds.
                  Banek does eventually draw such a line, but where society should
                  draw the line is a source of much dispute. As a nation we ought
                  to say that genocide is never acceptable, but in some situations
                  we do tolerate its practice by some of our allies, particularly
                  if they are not caught in the act. (U.S. opposition to the International
                  Criminal Court was supposed to be about fears it would be used
                  against Americans, but perhaps the fear is more that it might
                  impair our alliances with unsavory dictators.) We ought to say
                  that reckless indifference to human life is never permitted,
                  but we do tolerate this behavior by wealthy corporations, in
                  part because they buy acceptance with campaign contributions
                  and philanthropy.<br>
                   <br>
                  Critics claim that the company invests great effort in staying
                  one step ahead of regulators and prosecutors, because getting
                  caught might tip the equation that allows it a certain respectability.
                  Both McWane and <i>Changing Lanes</i> illustrate the lengths
                  to which some evil doers will go to keep their criminal behavior
                  out of the public eye. In the movies, where justice usually prevails,
                  the evil law firm cowers before a potential whistle-blower. In
                  real life, where money and power determine justice, McWane just
                  keeps on making pipe.</font></p>
