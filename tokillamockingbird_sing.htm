                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A child colours her drawing
                  of a bird with a black crayon on a sheet of white paper.  A feeling
                  of tranquility fills the air as the child innocently hums to
                  herself.  Suddenly, her paper is torn in the middle by an unknown
                  force.  The rip was so deep that it destroyed the bird.  This
                  was the beginning segment of the film <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>,
                  a 1960s movie based on Harper Lee's novel.<br>
                    <br>
                  <img src="images/mockingbird3.jpg" width="154" height="142" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The story took place
                  in Maycomb, a small town in Southern Alabama, where racial prejudice
                  was prevalent and was a part of everyday life.  Scout Finch,
                  the narrator of the story, reflects on an event from her childhood
                  that changed her family's life - the criminal prosecution of
                  Tom Robinson.  Tom, a Black man, was alleged to have raped and
                  battered a White woman, Mayella Ewell.  Atticus Finch, Scout's
                  father and a respectable lawyer in Maycomb, was appointed to
                  act as Tom's defense counsel. <br>
                   <br>
                  Not long after accepting his appointment, Atticus and his family
                  were subject to numerous negative remarks by the White community
                  for defending a Black man.  The primary person giving Atticus
                  a hard time was Bob Ewell, Mayella's alcoholic father.  The treatment
                  Atticus experienced for defending a Black person was not uncommon
                  nor was it unexpected in a time when Black people were regarded
                  as inferior to Whites.  This animosity towards the Black community
                  was also carried to Tom's trial and brought the legal system
                  into disrepute.<br>
<br>
                  Tom was never presumed to be innocent throughout his trial. 
                  In a criminal proceeding, the fundamental presumption is that
                  the accused is innocent until proven guilty.  For Tom, the jury
                  presumed he was guilty before entering the courtroom.  The jury's
                  presumption of guilt instead of innocence was not surprising
                  given the intense racial prejudice against Blacks in Maycomb.
                   As Bryan Fair has stated, when the presumption of innocence
                  becomes an &quot;<a href="#1">empty idea</a>&quot;  and racial
                  prejudice is allowed inside the courtroom, the integrity of the
                  criminal justice system fails.  It is almost unnecessary to have
                  a trial when the accused is already presumed to be guilty and
                  has a slim, if any, chance of being able to prove his or her
                  innocence before a biased jury.  Tom's trial served no purpose
                  and was more of an entertaining spectacle for the people of Maycomb.
<br>
                   <br>
                  In a system where only Whites control the rules, run the system
                  and decide the ultimate decisions, it is very difficult for a
                  Black person like Tom to be ensured that he would be treated
                  fairly.  Fair made this same point when he discussed the legal
                  system as being more than just rules, but &quot;also the people
                  who control and implement them.&quot;  <br>
                  It may at first blush raise skepticism and concern for the fairness
                  of the White defendant's trial. This skepticism and lack of trust
                  might arise from fear that Blacks would seek vengeance against
                  Whites for past wrongdoings.  This feeling of unfairness and
                  skepticism for most people would only be present in the hypothetical
                  and not in a situation where a Black defendant is to be tried
                  in a White dominated court.<br>
                    <br>
                  It is interesting that a White dominated judicial system would
                  be seen as being capable of being free from racial prejudice
                  towards a Black accused, whereas a Black dominated system would
                  be seen as being unable to separate racial animosity in their
                  justice system.  In my opinion, it is insulting to presume that
                  an all Black system would be incapable of administering a fair
                  trial.  This presumption has an underlying belief that Whites
                  are superior because Whites have the ability to put aside their
                  racial bias toward Blacks while Blacks would be unable to put
                  aside their vengeance and hatred toward Whites.  It implies that
                  Blacks are uncivilized because if given the chance, they would
                  seek vengeance through a system that was meant to bring order
                  and justice to society.<br>
                     <br>
                  Although vengeance can be a strong driving force to an unfair
                  trial, it is not the only factor to a tainted trial.  It is equally
                  likely that in any system that is controlled by a group of people
                  with a set of strong beliefs, there would be unfairness to other
                  minority groups regardless of who is the dominant group. Therefore,
                   to ensure a fair criminal justice system, neither group should
                  have major control over any steps of the process. <br>
<br>
                  Another factor that should be taken into account is the jury's
                  and the dominant society's personal beliefs and opinions of Blacks.
                   The environment one grew up in can play a powerful role as the
                  ideas and values from the surrounding community are influential
                  to a person's decisions and perspective.  As Atticus pointed
                  out in his closing statement, the jury has stereotypical presumptions
                  that all Black people lie and can't be trusted.  These beliefs
                  are prejudicial to Tom because members of the jury bring these
                  previously held biases and beliefs with them to court.  <br>
<br>
                  Using the trial in the film <i>Twelve Angry Men</i> as an example,
                  Lawrence Friedman argues that trials have an &quot;educational
                  function&quot; in which they reinforce a society's norms and
                  bind a society together </font><font size="-2" face="Verdana"><a href="#2">(2)</a></font><font size="-1" face="Verdana">.   In
                  other words, when the jury is determining the verdict, they are
                  also collectively reaffirming and reinforcing societal views
                  and norms.  Therefore, if the jury accepted Tom's testimony over
                  the Ewell's, it would be a significant shift in societal beliefs
                  that the Whites would not be prepared or willing to accept. 
                  By accepting Tom's testimony, it would suggest that Blacks are
                  not liars and perhaps also infer that like the Ewells, Whites
                  are liars and are the ones that should not be trusted.  Changing
                  a significant societal belief and stepping over what Friedman
                  calls as defined boundaries will be a shock to the system and
                  will as a result, weaken the order of the society.  Hence trials,
                  like Tom's case, are &quot;boundary-maintaining devices [that]
                  help cement social solidarity by redefining and proclaiming the
                  norms.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  An instance where the jury cannot find themselves to believe
                  Tom's testimony or willing to change a societal norm is that
                  a White woman would tempt a Black man and that an inferior Black
                  man would &quot;feel sorry&quot; for a White woman. In his article,
                  Friedman also commented a trial to be a &quot;narrative competition&quot;
                  where both sides attempt to persuade the jury to accept their
                  version of the fact.  The &quot;arguments presented in trials
                  are often important clues to what stories count as good, or true,
                  or compelling stories, within a particular culture.&quot; <br>
<br>
                  Members of the jury would most likely be compelled to believe
                  a story that they want to believe in.  In this case, the jury
                  would prefer Mayella's version of the story that an untrustworthy
                  Black man sexually assaulted a White woman.  This version would
                  be consistent with the belief that Black men can't be trusted,
                  especially around White women.  It is also consistent with the
                  perception that Blacks are undesirable.  As Atticus pointed out,
                  if Mayella had desired Tom, she would have broken a code of society
                  by tempting a Black man.<br>
                      <br>
                  Another explanation to the jury's difficulty in accepting Tom's
                  testimony is based on an interesting relationship discussed in
                  class about Aristotle's theory of pity.  Aristotle stated that
                  in order to have sympathy for another person, one must have relative
                  freedom from suffering.  As well, one generally feels pity for
                  someone who is their equal or who is inferior to them.  When
                  Tom indicated that he felt sympathy for Mayella, he was also
                  stating that Whites are inferior to Blacks or at most, equal
                  to Blacks.  Tom's story and expression of his sympathetic feelings
                  towards Mayella sound absurd in a culture that treats Blacks
                  as slaves and servants to the Whites.  As a result, a jury with
                  personal racial biases would find Tom's testimony of sympathizing
                  a White woman and Mayella's desire for him to be proof that Blacks
                  are liars.                                                  
                                                          <br>
                  Had Tom been a White person and gave the same evidence, the jury
                  would have acquitted.  A verdict was based entirely on racial
                  bias.  Or perhaps, the &quot;skin colour was the final arbiter&quot;
                  in court.  If racial bias controls and determines the outcome
                  of a case instead of the truth, the integrity of the legal system
                  is destroyed.  </font></p>
