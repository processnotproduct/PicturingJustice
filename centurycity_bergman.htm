                  In a companion <a href="centurycity_asimow.htm">essay</a> on
                  the new TV lawyer drama, <i>Century City</i>, Michael Asimow
                  likens the show to <i>L. A. Law</i>. However, the March 2004
                  premiere episode suggests that with a bit of watering, <i>Century
                  City</i>'s roots can stretch all the way back to <i>The Defenders</i>.
                  Like that classic TV show that ran from 1961-1965, <i>Century
                  City</i> seems interested in working through the legal ramifications
                  of important social issues. If the show is willing to trust its
                  audience to care about those issues at least as much as it does
                  the sex lives of the lawyers of the law firm of Crane, Constable,
                  McNeil &amp; Montero, the show may run long enough for some of
                  its associates to become partners.<br>
<br>
                  In the initial episode, idealistic new associate Lukas Gold persuades
                  the firm to represent a father charged with illegally bringing
                  a cloned embryo of his son into the country. The son has a fatal
                  liver disease, and the father can save his son's life by taking
                  the clone's liver and transplanting it into his son. (The show
                  is set futuristically in 2030, a time when cloning-on-demand
                  may be technologically possible but not yet legally acceptable.)
                  The father admits that he committed a crime, but asks Lukas and
                  the firm to free the seized clone so he can go forward with the
                  transplant. <br>
<br>
                  Watching capable lawyers battle over a public policy issue as
                  important as cloning was refreshing in an era when lawyer shows
                  tend to resemble either soap operas or paperback mysteries. At
                  the same time, I wanted to know much more about the legal ramifications
                  of cloning than <i>Century City</i> told me. For example, if
                  the father admittedly committed a crime by attempting to bring
                  the clone into the country, on what basis can he get it back?
                  After all, a person caught trying to transport illegal drugs
                  across the border doesn't get the drugs back. <i>Century City</i>
                  pays lip service to this issue, but the explanation was not very
                  satisfactory. Equally unsatisfactory is Lukas' argument that
                  while it may be OK for the government to prevent cloning, the
                  father should get this clone back because the cloning already
                  took place. The power of legal dramas is their ability to personalize
                  and therefore make viewers care about otherwise abstract legal
                  issues. They can use this power both to educate and entertain,
                  but only if they develop competing legal arguments in more depth
                  than I saw in <i>Century City</i>'s opening episode.<br>
<br>
                  Thus, <i>Century City</i> does indeed have promise. For me, that
                  promise will be fulfilled only if the show is willing to trust
                  to its viewers' intelligence, roll up its sleeves and really
                  grapple with legal issues. If it can accomplish that, the only
                  disappointed members of the viewing audience may be today's law
                  students. They'll see that law firm life in 2030 is as pressurized
                  and demanding of one's time as it is here in 2004. <br>
