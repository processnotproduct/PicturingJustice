                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Two humans visit the Cincinnati
                  Zoo and see a Bonobo Chimpanzee sitting in its habitat. The chimpanzee
                  regards them steadily while digging in the turf with a stick.
<br>
                  &quot;It's digging with a stick,&quot; Human One observes.<br>
                  &quot;It certainly is,&quot; Human Two agrees.<br>
                  &quot;That's some very intentional behavior,&quot; Human One
                  notes.<br>
                  &quot;Some literature says they're as smart as four-year-old
                  children. Maybe smarter.&quot;<br>
                  &quot;Gee.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  The humans watch while the chimp unearths and eats a grub. They
                  leave the exhibit and walk for a few hundred yards, shelling
                  their peanuts. Human One stops his tracks with a peanut halfway
                  to his mouth. &quot;Wait a minute. If that's true, is it right
                  to keep them in zoos?&quot;<br>
<br>
                  This question, and the natural follow-up questions of whether
                  it is &quot;right&quot; to eat chicken, &quot;right&quot; to
                  make shoes from cow hide, or &quot;right&quot; to kill zooplankton
                  in lakes, reflect classic philosophical quandaries about the
                  values that humans place upon non-human organisms. Current arguments
                  for legal recognition of non-human organisms reside everywhere
                  along a spectrum that begins at the mere presence of life and
                  extends into demonstrated self-awareness. At any given point
                  on this moral value spectrum, someone argues that the organism
                  has now attained a degree of moral value that justifies the organism's
                  interests affecting, on some level, humans' interests. <br>

                  <img src="images/starbeast.gif.jpg" width="150" height="250" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Over 45 years ago,
                  science fiction author and sometime political philosopher Robert
                  A. Heinlein posed similar questions in his juvenile fiction THE
                  STAR BEAST (first copyright 1954). In THE STAR BEAST, John Thomas
                  Stuart XI, a human teenager, keeps in his backyard a creature
                  he calls Lummox. Lummox looks &quot;something like a rhinoceros,
                  something like a triceratops,&quot; sports eight stumpy legs,
                  and stands about seven feet high. Lummox can speak broken English,
                  but the characters debate whether Lummox has real intelligence
                  or whether he merely parrots human speech. Lummox has lived with
                  the Stuart family for several generations, passing by inheritance
                  from father to son.<br>
<br>
                  One day, Lummox escapes the backyard and tours the town. The
                  townspeople bring property damage claims and criminal charges
                  against Stuart. Lummox's case comes to the attention of Earth's
                  Department of Spatial Affairs, which sends its representative
                  Sergei Greenberg to Stuart's hometown. Greenberg must determine
                  whether Lummox belongs to any extraterrestrial race that has
                  a treaty with Earth entitling its members to reciprocal legal
                  rights.<br>
<br>
                  Greenberg initially determines that Lummox is ineligible for
                  legal status under Earth's treaties. He returns to the Department
                  of Spatial Affairs to attend to a more pressing matter: negotiations
                  with a heretofore-unknown extraterrestrial race called the Hroshii.
                  The Hroshii claim that Earth is holding one of its members hostage
                  and threaten to invade Earth if this Hroshia (singular) is not
                  returned. Because the Hroshii look nothing at all like Lummox,
                  the Department of Spatial Affairs flirts with an interstellar
                  incident until Spatial Affairs personnel identify Lummox as an
                  immature Hroshia. Spatial Affairs hastily recovers Lummox and
                  turns Lummox over to the Hroshii-but she (for Lummox is female
                  and in fact a Hroshii princess) refuses to return to her home
                  planet unless she receives assurances that she may to continue
                  her lifelong hobby: breeding and raising John Thomas Stuarts.

<br>
                  THE STAR BEAST does not pretend to be a legal text. However,
                  it asks surprisingly rich and timely questions about legal status
                  for non-human animals. Under Heinlein's framework, an organism
                  earns a sort of &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; when it displays
                  certain attributes and capabilities. THE STAR BEAST'S tests emerge
                  as follow: If an organism has a speech center, manipulative organs,
                  the capacity to write and keep records, and a certain intelligence,
                  the creature receives legal rights similar to those accorded
                  to humans. A close examination of Heinlein's xenological tests
                  reveals that these tests contemplate many of the same ethical
                  questions set forth by modern organism rights scholars. <br>
<br>
                  <i>A. The &quot;Speech Center&quot; Test<br>
                  </i><br>
                  Modern organism rights arguments provide two justifications for
                  Heinlein's speech center requirement. First, a speech center
                  can indicate a high level of physical evolution. An argument
                  for animal rights based on evolution assumes that the animal
                  at the top of the evolutionary scale got there because it is
                  a &quot;fitter&quot; form of animal. The argument assumes that
                  holding the &quot;fittest&quot; position on the evolutionary
                  scale bestows intrinsic moral value, and the organisms that achieve
                  this high status earn legal recognition. <br>
<br>
                  Second, a speech center can indicate that the organism understands
                  and uses symbolic language. &quot;Language,&quot; as compared
                  to mere &quot;communication,&quot; indicates an ability to agree
                  upon, use, and understand abstract symbols. The argument that
                  symbol use should lead to increased moral value only works if
                  one assumes that a hoot, growl, chirp, or roar communicates information
                  but does not embody symbols that require translation or interpretation.
                  Scholars counterargue, however, that linguistic ability need
                  not exist at a level where humans can understand it. <i>&quot;Why,&quot;</i>
                  they ask, <i>&quot;should animals have evolved an ability to
                  indicate anything to human beings? Is it not enough that they
                  may be able to communicate adequately with their own species?</i>&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">2</a>) Heinlein agrees. <i>&quot;Assuming that
                  an [extraterrestrial] is stupid because he can't speak our language
                  well is like assuming that an Italian is illiterate because he
                  speaks broken English.&quot;</i>(<a href="#footnotes">3</a>)<br>
<br>
                  <i>B. The &quot;Manipulative Organs&quot; Test<br>
                  </i><br>
                  Like the speech center test, a &quot;manipulative organs&quot;
                  test places moral value on a high degree of physical evolution.
                  An across-the-board application of this test, however, extends
                  high moral value to any creature that can manipulate its environment.
                  It would grant legal rights, for example, to a bower bird, which
                  builds nests and decorates them with twigs, shells, and stones.
                  It would also grant legal rights to a beetle that can lift and
                  carry small objects. Such an interpretation makes little sense,
                  because it fails to fit Heinlein's proposed system under which
                  some organisms merely deserve humane protection and others receive
                  legal rights. Therefore, Heinlein must have designed this test
                  to reflect some cognitive ability. <br>
<br>
                  The use of cognition as a justification assigning high moral
                  value to certain organisms becomes even more compelling when
                  the organism in question appears to use a tool, i.e., selects
                  a specific intermediary object to accomplish something the organism
                  apparently understands that it cannot do with its body alone.
                  <i>&quot;Self-awareness, as represented by second-order volitions,
                  is a necessary and sufficient criterion for perceiving (and therefore
                  presumably valuing) the . . . interests of liberty and autonomy.&quot;</i>(<a href="#footnotes">4</a>)<br>
<br>
                  <i>C. The &quot;Writing and Record Keeping&quot; Test<br>
                  </i><br>
                  Heinlein's writing and record keeping test translates to demonstrated
                  self-awareness. An organism that keeps records indicates by such
                  action that it knows &quot;I existed yesterday, I exist today,
                  and I am aware that there will be a tomorrow.&quot; Given that
                  no other known species on modern Earth writes or keeps records,
                  one might assume that writing and record-keeping are purely human
                  pursuits. However, record-keeping need not logically include
                  writing. Even humans have oral history traditions. Organisms
                  that communicate among themselves could have oral traditions
                  also. Until humans learn these organisms' language, humans could
                  not properly apply this test.<br>
<br>
                  <i>D. The &quot;Relative Intelligence Quotient on a Human Scale&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">5</a>)Test<br>
                  </i><br>
                  Heinlein's inquiry into a &quot;relative intelligence quotient&quot;
                  finds several analogs in modern arguments for animal standing.
                  First, a primate's well-developed brain supports the &quot;evolution
                  equals moral value&quot; argument by indicating a high capacity
                  for measurable intelligence. Second, presuming that Heinlein
                  had a standard Stanford-Binet intelligence test in mind, the
                  organism's short-term memory, verbal skills, quantitative reasoning
                  skills, and abstract reasoning skills would all support its bid
                  for high moral value based on cognition. The speed and quality
                  of such reasoning constitutes &quot;intelligence.&quot; Similar
                  arguments cite organisms' ability to learn as proper evidence
                  of a moral value that deserves an attendant legal right. <br>
<br>
                  Before applying Heinlein's tests to a species of organism, one
                  must eliminate the problem of low-level function in individual
                  organisms. Thomas Kelch's concept of &quot;deliberate rationality&quot;
                  addresses the problem neatly, resolving the current paradox inherent
                  in the fact that many humans believe it is acceptable to behead
                  breathing, walking, pecking chickens but unacceptable to behead
                  breathing comatose humans. Kelch's test applies a given species
                  as a whole. If the species displays capacity for &quot;deliberate
                  rationality&quot; as a generalizable characteristic, each individual
                  of that species will be accorded, at minimum, legal rights consummate
                  with the species' capability to understand its own interests.<br>
<br>
                  Applying Heinlein's tests to the Cincinnati Zoo's Bonobo chimpanzee
                  produces interesting results. First, does the chimpanzee have
                  a speech center? It hoots, grunts, growls, and screeches, but
                  it does not produce human speech. However, several primates across
                  the United States reportedly possess and use American Sign Language
                  vocabularies. Research also reveals that some Bonobo chimpanzees
                  can <i>&quot;comprehend simple sentences and simple syntactic
                  structures&quot;</i>(<a href="#footnotes">6</a>). If Bonobo chimpanzees
                  can communicate with sign language and comprehend speech, and
                  if those abilities are a normal characteristic of the species,
                  Kelch's deliberate rationality test extends those characteristics
                  to this chimpanzee and the chimpanzee could arguably pass the
                  speech center test based on its ability to use and understand
                  symbols.<br>
<br>
                  The chimpanzee's human-type digital hands unquestionably pass
                  the manipulative organs test. A chimpanzee uses its hands to
                  grasp and hold objects. This particular chimpanzee used a stick
                  to dig in the ground and produce grubs. Although it passes this
                  test, it fails the record-keeping test (as far as we know). So
                  finally we ask, &quot;what is the chimpanzee's quotient relative
                  to a human's?&quot; <br>
<br>
                  Although primate researchers may delight in claiming that primates
                  are nearly as smart as humans, actual IQ test information is
                  not available at a level of specificity that accurately compensates
                  for environmental variables between humans and primates. Because
                  Heinlein does not propose a standard for relative intelligence,
                  one cannot conclude whether the chimpanzee fails or passes this
                  test. If, however, philosophers would assign moral to cognitive
                  ability identical in kind, if not degree, to that of a human,
                  the chimpanzee stands a good chance of passing this test. <br>
<br>
                  Of Heinlein's four xenological tests for assigning legal rights
                  to organisms, all of which encompass modern philosophical justifications
                  for assigning moral value to the organism being tested, the Bonobo
                  chimpanzee passes two, fails one, and might pass the third depending
                  on the moral value assigned to cognitive capability. Such a result
                  weighs in favor of assigning legal rights to the Bonobo chimpanzee.
                  At the very least, such a result invites further study to determine
                  whether the Bonobo chimpanzee could pass all the xenological
                  tests if the tests were modified to accommodate modern scientific
                  and behavioral study methodology.<br>
<br>
                  When pursuing the worthy goal of seeking human-level legal rights
                  for non-human organisms, scholars, writers, and activists must
                  offer the legal community a concrete argument in favor of assigning
                  significant moral value to these organisms. Heinlein's xenological
                  tests encompass the key philosophical arguments presented in
                  law journals, academic reports, and organism rights advocacy
                  essays. Although they first appear in speculative fiction, and
                  although they would require some modification to apply to organism
                  rights advocacy, Heinlein's mid-century visions reflect much
                  of today's jurisprudential reality.</font></p>
