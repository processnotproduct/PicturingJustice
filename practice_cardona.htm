                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by George Cardona</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This season's premiere of <i>The
                  Practice</i> begins at the scene of a crime already committed,
                  the house of a state senator in whose bed there is the very bloody
                  body of a very dead man.  The body is not the first thing seen,
                  however.  The opening shots of the episode turn only last to
                  the body, focusing first on the three others in the house: the
                  state senator, sitting upright in the living room, clothed only
                  in underwear, waiting for someone; his daughter, vomiting in
                  a bathroom; and his wife, showering.  This focus is appropriate,
                  for as it unravels the episode is far less about the crime than
                  it is about the efforts of these three to manipulate perceptions
                  of the crime, feeding misinformation to and relying on faulty
                  assumptions by the prosecutors, the police, the media, and even
                  their own attorneys to conceal what really happened in the senator's
                  bedroom.  That these efforts are ultimately successful (the true
                  turn of events is revealed only at the very end of the episode,
                  under circumstances-- a privileged conversation between attorney
                  and client -- that ensure that the true facts will never be publicly
                  known) rests on two aspects of the criminal justice system that
                  are (accounting both for dramatic license and the time constraints
                  imposed by the need to resolve everything within a two-hour,
                  less commercials, time slot) remarkably well conveyed: the ability
                  of criminal suspects with the necessary knowledge and resources
                  to hinder discovery of the truth and the extent to which criminal
                  prosecutions are affected by public opinion.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Criminal investigations move
                  forward under a number of constraints imposed by the Constitution,
                  ethical rules and practices, and common-law privileges.  Intended
                  to prevent innocent suspects with limited resources from being
                  overwhelmed by an overreaching state enlisting its formidable
                  resources to pursue a conviction counter to the truth, these
                  same constraints can be used by those with the resources and
                  the will to make it very difficult for a well-meaning state to
                  uncover the truth.  The state senator is clearly not one without
                  resources.  Nor is he one unfamiliar with or unwilling to use
                  the mechanisms for manipulation available to those suspected
                  of a crime.  The first to arrive, for whom the senator is waiting,
                  are not the police, but his attorney.  And the senator's first
                  words make clear both his intent and his awareness of the means
                  to accomplish it.  Not for him a panicked confession.  Instead,
                  his first words, essentially &quot;Tell me what I can tell you
                  that will not prevent you from representing me,&quot; signal
                  what is just the start of a relationship in which the attorney-client
                  relationship will be used by the senator as both a shield and
                  a sword, his consultations (and those of his family members whom
                  the firm also represents) with the firm's attorneys protected
                  from discovery by the state, while he uses them to shape the
                  misinformation he will provide.  The episode captures particularly
                  well the dilemma this poses for the senator's attorneys; though
                  they come to suspect they are being used, their ethical obligations
                  to their clients limit their ability to do anything about it.
                   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The first stage of the senator's
                  defense further demonstrates the mechanisms available to hinder
                  a criminal investigation.  The initial decision by the senator's
                  attorneys, one increasingly common, is to stonewall police efforts
                  to talk to any of the three people present at the scene of the
                  crime.  The senator relies on his Fifth Amendment rights.  His
                  wife asserts spousal privilege.  And the daughter relies on an
                  ethical rule that prohibits the prosecutor from interviewing
                  her without the presence of her counsel, in this case the same
                  attorneys who represent the senator, a presence that can, and
                  in this case does, eliminate the possibility of the interview
                  generating any meaningful information.  The growing frustration
                  of the prosecutor at her inability to pierce this wall rings
                  true, as does the result.  Confronted with an inability to obtain
                  any information about how the homicide occurred, and faced with
                  a rapidly evaporating time frame in which to gather ephemeral
                  physical evidence, the prosecutor is forced to guess at how the
                  crime was committed and structure the investigation accordingly.
                   Such guesses are not uncommon.   But when they are incorrect,
                  the investigation can take an initial wrong turn from which it
                  never recovers.  Such is the case here.  The prosecutor makes
                  the guess that many would, that the senator discovered his wife
                  in bed with another man and, whether in a fit of rage or in cold-blooded
                  hate, shot him; accordingly, she has the senator arrested, declares
                  the wife a material witness, and seeks a court order to test
                  the wife for physical evidence of sexual activity consistent
                  with the suspected affair.  As revealed at the very end of the
                  episode, this guess is completely wrong, and it forestalls the
                  police from gathering the physical evidence that might have revealed
                  for what they are various witnesses' lies and faulty assumptions
                  about what really went on in the bedroom in the moments before
                  the shooting.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Throughout the investigation
                  and trial, both sides are shown spending as much, or more, time
                  seeking to gauge and shape public opinion as they do actually
                  investigating and trying the case.  Thus, the prosecutor seeks
                  to parlay the stonewall tactics of the defense into a benefit
                  by timely interviews suggesting (without violating ethical rules
                  that would prohibit a direct statement) that the senator's silence
                  must mean he has something to hide.  The defense does not seek
                  recourse because, as one attorney puts it  (in paraphrase), &quot;We
                  are going to need the press more than they do.&quot;  Soon, the
                  defense takes the offensive, the senator holding a masterful
                  press conference in which he garners immense sympathy by portraying
                  himself as the cuckolded husband who, seeking to defend his wife
                  from what he believes to be a rapist, unknowingly shoots the
                  man who is her lover.  The prosecution responds not in court,
                  but with its own press statement.  And during trial, the defense
                  structures its case based in part on opinions of a shadow jury
                  conveyed to the defense through an off-camera consultant while
                  both sides constantly seek guidance in polls of public reaction
                  reported by television legal experts.  Putting aside a few excesses
                  acceptable for dramatic purposes, all of this mirrors actual
                  tactics in high-profile criminal cases, which, despite the best
                  efforts of many judges, inevitably end up being tried in the
                  media at the same time as in the courtroom.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Fittingly, even the resolution
                  of the case is rooted not in any belief that it is factually
                  correct, but in the need to cater to public perceptions.  After
                  a lie by the senator's daughter during her testimony places the
                  prosecution's case at risk, a decision is made to offer a favorable
                  plea deal, a decision rooted in the district attorney's recognition
                  that this is a case he cannot afford to lose.  The senator's
                  attorneys, who in an earlier discussion are seen fretting that
                  their reputation will hinge on this case, their firm being known
                  forever after as the one that had either lost or won, had originally
                  favored a deal, but now, with victory in their sights, advise
                  against it.  The senator, despite this advice, insists on accepting
                  the deal, conditioned, however, on his ability to hold a press
                  conference before being taken into custody; as that press conference
                  reveals, the senator has agreed to the plea because it affords
                  him an opportunity to once again portray himself as the victim,
                  this time both the husband wronged by his adulterous wife and
                  the father seeking to protect his well-meaning but misguided
                  daughter from a possible perjury prosecution.  Moreover, as we
                  learn later, the plea has provided the senator an opportunity
                  to ensure the concealment of facts he regards as more devastating
                  to his public persona than his criminal conviction.  All of the
                  parties have at least suspicions (and in the senator's case actual
                  knowledge) that the plea does not represent factual truth.  Nevertheless,
                  the plea is acceptable to all concerned both because it cannot
                  be shown to be false and because it offers the best available
                  means for preserving their respective public reputations.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Whether the rights accorded
                  criminal suspects, the role played by the media in high profile
                  trials, and more fundamentally the very nature of this country's
                  adversarial system of criminal justice work to further a search
                  for the truth (or whether they should) is an ongoing debate.
                   This episode of <i>The Practice</i> aptly highlights this debate.</font></p>
