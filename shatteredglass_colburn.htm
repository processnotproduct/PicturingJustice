<br>
                  <i>Shattered Glass</i>, the film about &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743227123/qid%3D1086718579/sr%3D8-1/ref%3Dsr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-7295407-5447813?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Fabulist</a>&quot;
                  reporter Stephen Glass, is not necessarily a movie about law,
                  justice or the practice of either. It's about the practice of
                  journalism in America today and specifically at one of its premier
                  institutions, The New Republic. But it pushes a very interesting
                  subtext about someone who wants to be a lawyer and in this respect
                  tells a great story. When I say &quot;wants to be a lawyer,&quot;
                  I mean to distinguish Glass-who apparently hungered for it-from
                  so many other who choose it for lack of something better to do.
                  The film doesn't just show Glass's transition to a new profession,
                  though. It also suggests how these two professions are becoming
                  more and more alike.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/shatteredglass.jpg" width="173" height="128" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In
                  the movie and in real life Glass enrolls at Georgetown Law even
                  while his practice of journalism is taking him to seemingly fantastic
                  professional heights. Glass is clearly not one of the many in
                  law schools today who are there because a Political Science or
                  Philosophy major packaged them for little else. He is, you must
                  see, &quot;successful&quot; at what he is doing. Depending on
                  how you interpret Glass's character in the film, though, you
                  could take his story as either a parable about sham performances
                  generally or about an ambitious maniac who zeroes in on the precise
                  weaknesses of a system begging to be gamed for profit. That interpretive
                  choice, I'd wager, says something about what kind of lawyer (or
                  journalist) you'd be, have been, or are.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The practice of law and the
                  practice of journalism are very different and yet very similar.
                  Journalists live to report facts and usually they have &quot;fact-checkers&quot;
                  and editors who must independently verify the claims they are
                  about to make. For some facts, though, these third-parties are
                  without any real means of independent verification (say, for
                  quotes from sources whom the journalist has interviewed). On
                  some pieces, Glass intones at one point, &quot;the only source
                  material available are the notes provided by the reporter himself.&quot;
                  The notes must be proof enough, at least until the recriminations
                  roll in on a published story. Cook up the right &quot;record&quot;
                  as Glass does habitually, in other words, and the institutional
                  check in place to safeguard veracity is easily circumvented.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Now I'll grant it is no help
                  that, at least in the film, Glass's superiors often seem anaesthetized
                  to clues suggesting-they're even slow finally to believe-that
                  Glass is a sham. And this seems as much because of how he pitches
                  his work and how popular his pieces are as it is because of the
                  &quot;quality&quot; of that work. Glass's pieces are good for
                  the bottom line and, in that, his bosses' casualness with &quot;the
                  facts&quot; might be rather familiar to many lawyers. If it were
                  cheap and profitable, why wouldn't an editor admire it enough
                  to take Glass's word as verification enough? Of course this is
                  not necessarily how it has to be: anyone can imagine a verification
                  system that would not print any story which hasn't been truly,
                  independently verified. We just can't imagine it successfully
                  competing with all the other &quot;journalism&quot; outlets in
                  the market today.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Throughout the film the audience
                  is shown Glass's version of journalism and its worth to outlets
                  like The New Republic, Harper's, and Rolling Stone. In the opening
                  scene, Glass narrates that the practice of journalism is &quot;the
                  art of capturing behavior.&quot; It soon becomes clear that the
                  flash, panache, and unbelievable timeliness of his &quot;scoops&quot;
                  are what catapult him to his success so much more quickly than
                  the steadiness and method-and simple relevance-of his peers'
                  reporting. Richly, while all of this is going on the audience
                  catches the occasional glimpse of Glass in his office studying
                  and highlighting the all-too-identifiable casebook, hard at work
                  preparing, one surmises, for his truly desired profession.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Being trained as a lawyer and
                  as an academic (and therefore being as protective of &quot;the
                  facts&quot; as I flatter myself to be), I have to admit that
                  this is really what decided the interpretation of the film for
                  me. For, on balance, I think there are more Glasses in the world
                  than some (journalists) might like to admit. In fact, Glass's
                  particular mania is how <i>Shattered Glass</i> dovetails with
                  other recent scandals in journalism, most notably <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2004/05/raines.htm">Jayson
                  Blair</a> of The New York Times. Blair was also a meteoric success
                  whose reporting turned out to be, repeatedly and overtly, predicated
                  on bald fabrications that his paper failed to catch. One keeper
                  of <a href="http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=40733">journalistic
                  ethics</a> said that, in the wake of so many of these scandals,
                  &quot;[n]ews organizations face an uphill battle in regaining
                  the public's trust.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Now even in our post-modern
                  world, reporting like Glass's is &quot;indefensible&quot; in
                  the words of editor Charles Lane (who finally fired Glass after
                  he had defrauded the magazine and its readers in at least 27
                  of his 41 stories). For me, though, the scheme underscored how
                  much today's practice of journalism resembles the practice of
                  law. Because while each of the spectacular disgraces to news
                  organizations lately have involved violations of basic professional
                  ethics, what they've done is by now common in the practice of
                  law: they push the envelope of practice norms a shade too far.
                  It is perfectly acceptable in some newsrooms (from what I've
                  read and been told) to &quot;composite&quot; characters together
                  and make them seem like &quot;real&quot; sources, sources to
                  whom &quot;real&quot; statements are attributed. And of course
                  &quot;real&quot; reporters share a stage every day with people
                  whose very objective-whose ethos-is to make the games of politics
                  and world affairs more &quot;entertaining&quot; or more &quot;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/?040524crbo_books">homespun</a>.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Glass's fall from The New Republic
                  to the humility of a seat in the Georgetown Law class (he graduated
                  in 2000 and has recently applied for admission to the New York
                  Bar) is meant as a tragedy it seems. Lane doesn't allow Glass
                  to take his Rolodex from his office as he is being booted, but
                  he does allow him his &quot;law books&quot;-an allusion to the
                  character of the profession that might still have him. Yet the
                  <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=36&aid=43343">malaise</a>
                  in several of American journalism's premier institutions today
                  is easily the bigger tragedy. The market predicament these institutions
                  face for the foreseeable future make them look like some law
                  firms I know: the profit motive dominates the professional culture.
                  In journalism the result is an overarching objective to entertain,
                  to titillate. In law it is an overarching need to serve the client.
                  If you also see that as the larger trope of this film, I would
                  bet that you've either: (1) practiced law long enough to have
                  seen it firsthand, (2) practiced journalism long enough to have
                  seen it firsthand, or (3) that you are an especially keen observer
                  of popular culture's portrayal of these professions.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Of course, an interpretive
                  choice has nothing to do with your moral character as a professional.
                  But anyone who still practices conscientiously in one of these
                  two fields today even while they spiral downward both in terms
                  of professionalism and public esteem (or, worse, after she has
                  personally encountered the ambitious maniac gaming a weak system)
                  will see in <i>Shattered Glass</i> a just, if fleeting, reckoning
                  between facts and norms.<br>
