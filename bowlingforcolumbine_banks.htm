                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Taunya Lovell Banks</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Who would ever think that there
                  is a connection between the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School
                  and race. Initially, I resisted an underlying premise of Michael
                  Moore's latest documentary film, <i>Bowling for Columbine</i>,
                  that there is a connection between race and the National Rifle
                  Association's (NRA) opposition to gun control. So what if the
                  NRA was founded in 1871 the same year that the Ku Klux Klan was
                  outlawed, mere coincidence. So what if student witnesses at Columbine
                  claimed that the one black victim of the massacre was killed
                  just because he was black, mere speculation. So what if former
                  NRA spokesman Charlton Heston attributes the significantly higher
                  rate of gun violence in the United States than Canada to our
                  greater ethnic diversity, even Moore admits that Canada is pretty
                  diverse too.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/bowlingforcolumbine.jpg" width="188" height="130" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Then
                  I remembered that the Virginia Colony in 1639 enacted a law providing
                  that &quot;all persons except negroes to be provided with arms
                  and ammunition or be fined.&quot; Thus, one of the earliest laws
                  in English colonial America that distinguishes blacks from non-blacks
                  regulated gun possession. A year later a second law clarified
                  that &quot;all persons&quot; included any &quot;capable&quot;
                  unfree non-negro person (i.e., indentured servant). This mandate
                  to arm grew out of a well-founded fear by colonialists that local
                  hostile indigenous groups would massacre them. Understandably,
                  these Indians were hostile because the colonialists were taking
                  their land</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Moore tries to convey the historical
                  connection between whites' fear of non-whites and the protection
                  of gun ownership using an eight minute cartoon. The cartoon starts
                  with the Mayflower, focuses on the colonists' fear of indigenous
                  people, and only links this fear to blacks as we approach the
                  civil rights era. Yet the Virginia colonial law illustrates how
                  these two fears combined from the beginning, suggesting that
                  European settlers feared armed black slaves or servants as much
                  as or more than attacking Indians.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In 1991 Robert Cottrol and
                  Raymond Diamond wrote a provocative article advancing what they
                  claimed to be an &quot;African American perspective&quot; on
                  the Second Amendment's right to bear arms language. They pointed
                  out that most colonies, while not prohibiting free blacks from
                  owning firearms prevented blacks, and often Indians, from serving
                  in the militia. After the Civil War black codes enacted by southern
                  states generally prohibited blacks from owning firearms. During
                  and after slavery blacks needed weapons to protect themselves
                  from white violence. The inability of blacks to protect themselves
                  from white violence, especially post emancipation, Cottrol and
                  Diamond assert, effectively undercut their constitutional and
                  statutory rights.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once I opened my mind to Moore's
                  premise, I was reminded of more recent attempts to regulate gun
                  possession by blacks. Notable among them was the Chicago Housing
                  Authority's 1988 &quot;Clean Sweep&quot; policy authorizing warrantless
                  sweeps of public housing units and confiscation of unlicensed
                  or unauthorized weapons. The policy was instituted in response
                  to resident complaints about the unsafe living conditions resulting
                  from the widespread violence in the housing projects. Litigation
                  followed and the circumstances for conducting the searches restricted
                  until, in response to death of seven-year-old boy in fall of
                  1992, the housing authority instituted an even more aggressive
                  sweep program that resulted in further litigation. Although the
                  housing authority's policy was facially neutral, most of the
                  public housing residents affected by this policy were black.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Other cities, plagued by crime
                  and violence, instituted gun amnesty programs encouraging inner
                  city residents, most of whom are black, to turn in all unlicensed
                  guns, sometimes in exchange for money. Yet, no one would suggest
                  after the massacre at Columbine that police officials institute
                  a gun amnesty program or conduct clean sweeps of the houses in
                  Littleton Colorado. In fact, the response of many Americans might
                  be arm yourself to protect your family. Thus, Cottrol and Diamond
                  argue, black Americans who live in an environment where violence
                  is an everyday threat also should have access to weapons. Their
                  conclusion, while understandable, does not make the community
                  any safer. Just as selective access to and restrictions on guns
                  is not the answer to America's gun violence problem, neither
                  is arming everyone.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The consequences of unregulated
                  gun control are displayed in a chilling scene where we see the
                  actual tape of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the Columbine shooters,
                  as they rampage through the school cafeteria. I kept wondering
                  whether the students in the cafeteria who survived the massacre
                  will ever fully recover from this trauma. Moore does not address
                  the psychic trauma of people and communities impacted by gun
                  violence. He simply questions American's love of guns.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Throughout the documentary
                  Moore, a life member of the NRA, carefully navigates the line
                  between being anti-gun and anti-gun regulation. His focus is
                  gun violence rather than gun use. Nowhere in the film is this
                  point conveyed so clearly as when he compares gun ownership and
                  gun violence in foreign countries, notably Canada (7 million
                  gun owners and fewer than 100 gun-related deaths), with gun ownership
                  and violence in the United States. Suggesting that there is not
                  necessarily a correlation between gun ownership and gun violence,
                  Moore effectively undercuts the traditional explanation for America's
                  gun violence.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In a funny, eureka-like moment,
                  Moore inserts a clip of comic Chris Rock questioning gun control
                  and asserting that bullets not guns kill people. Rock's solution
                  to America's gun violence -- make the cost of bullets so prohibitive
                  that people will think twice before shooting some one. The audience
                  laughed, but I bet some thought that Rock had a good idea. As
                  a follow-up, Moore accompanies two Columbine survivors to K-mart's
                  headquarter to ask the corporate officers to stop selling bullets
                  in their stores.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Whether you agree or disagree
                  with Michael Moore's point of view, <i>Bowling for Columbine</i>
                  raises provocative questions about the NRA, the prevalence of
                  gun violence in the United States and American's resistance to
                  gun control legislation. Occasionally Moore seems to stray far
                  a field alleging connections between gun violence and the Clinton
                  administration's &quot;workfare&quot; welfare reform policy.
                  There are other flaws as well such as the linking the Columbine
                  massacre to the presence of Lockheed Martin in Littleton. Moore's
                  self indulgence causes the movie to run about 30 minutes longer
                  than necessary. Nevertheless, <i>Bowling for Columbine</i> is
                  a must see film for the questions it raises about America's love
                  of guns and penchant for violence.</font></p>
