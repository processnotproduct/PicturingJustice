                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by John Denvir</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Most lawyers in movies and
                  television are portrayed as heroes. But not all film lawyers
                  are &quot;good.&quot; And the lawyer villains are just as instructive
                  about popular conceptions of law and justice as their hero counterparts.
                  Often Hollywood shows us these legal villains as big firm lawyers
                  defending corporate interests. My two personal favorite &quot;villain
                  &quot; lawyers are Ed Concannon (James Mason) in <i>The Verdict</i>
                  and Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall) in <i>A Civil Action</i>.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/verdict2.jpg" width="98" height="140" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Ed Concannon is Paul Newman's
                  nemesis in <i>The Verdict</i>. He defends the hospital owned
                  by the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Boston where Newman's client
                  came to harm. Concannon is a &quot;bad&quot; lawyer only in a
                  moral sense. He is a superb legal technician with a keen insight
                  into human psychology. We are not surprised that he has risen
                  to the top of his profession in the tort defense bar.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">We first see him meet a small
                  squadron of associates in a conference room in his law firm.
                  The room is part college seminar room complete with blackboard
                  and part Renaissance palace with ornate fireplace and a uniformed
                  butler serving coffee. This setting perfectly reflects the mixture
                  of intellect and privilege that the contemporary large American
                  law firm tries to project. And Concannon's message to his minions
                  is clear: the goal is to win and to win decisively. The fact
                  that the plaintiff is a young mother entombed in an iron lung
                  because of a medical foul-up at his client's hospital is no more
                  than an obstacle to victory that must be overcome</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Later in the film we see how
                  victory is achieved. There is a skillful preparation for trial
                  testimony of the stuff shirt doctor in which Concannon first
                  destroys his client's story and then rebuilds it according to
                  a script that will appeal to the jury. We also seen him cleverly
                  discredit the plaintiff's expert witness and persuasively argue
                  arcane procedural points to keep out damaging evidence. His technical
                  performance is indeed superb. But Concannon goes even further,
                  inserting his own personal spy in the enemy camp to keep him
                  informed of the plaintiff's strategy. I assume this is an example
                  of art surpassing reality.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Screeenwriter David Mamet gives
                  us a riveting scene where Concannon articulates his philosophy
                  of law practice. It's all about winning because that's all that
                  clients pay for. And then he sets out the all the &quot;perks&quot;
                  that winning subsidizes. It's winning that pays for the fancy
                  office, the stylish clothes, the single malt whiskey, and even
                  the pro bono work the firm performs. Finally he puts in the dagger
                  to the liberal law professor's heart: winning even finances the
                  luxury of philosophical chats about the larger meaning of law.
<br>
<br>
                  Ed Concannon is corrupted by his love of wealth, but this vice
                  does not explain the professional actions of Jerome Facher, one
                  of the corporate defense lawyers in <i>A Civil Action</i>. Facher
                  has no special interest in money. Despite his partnership in
                  a blue blood Boston law firm, he wears inexpensive suits and
                  carries an well-worn brief case. No connoisseur of single malt
                  scotch, Facher seems happiest at a table in the firm's law library
                  eating homemade sandwiches and listening to a baseball game on
                  radio.<br>
<br>
                  Facher just likes to win for the sport of it. He's the quintessential
                  legal craftsman, using all the technicalities of the law to protect
                  his client with scant thought about the justice of the result.
                  We have no doubt he would be no more or less interested and just
                  as effective if assigned the other side of the case. For Facher,
                  the game's the thing and winning is the game.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/civilaction.gif" width="96" height="140" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In <i>A Civil Action</i> Facher's
                  opponent in Jan Schlichtmann ( John Travolta), a flashy trial
                  lawyer who is attempting to sue two large corporations for the
                  deaths which have resulted from the pollution of drinking water
                  in a small Massachusetts town. Facher takes the depositions of
                  the plaintiffs who appear to be honest working people who have
                  been devastated by deaths caused by the poisoned water. The primary
                  lesson Facher draws from this encounter is that these witnesses
                  must never be allowed to testify before a jury. He then sells
                  the judge of a procedural plan that accomplishes exactly this
                  goal. The judge sends the technical question of negligence to
                  the jury before allowing the plaintiffs to testify to damages,
                  thereby insulating the jury from the real world effects of his
                  clients' actions heart-breaking stories. He's successful and
                  his client is exonerated. He's won the game.<br>
<br>
                  Facher is the lawyer as brilliant cynic. When Schlichtmann tells
                  him the jury will find out the truth, he replies &quot; The Truth?
                  I thought were talking about a court of law.&quot; For Facher,
                  law is a war with little connection to truth or justice. <br>
<br>
                  While James Mason's Concannan is a wee bit pompous, Duvall's
                  Facher comes across as unassuming and almost likeable. He announces
                  at one settlement conference that he has just been given a Chair
                  at Harvard Law School, only to explain that the &quot;chair&quot;
                  is made of wood and is a gift from students in his trial practice
                  course. At Harvard he teaches not the grand principles of legal
                  theory but the legal craftsman's skills of quietly disrupting
                  an opponent's case. Facher is what we sometimes call a &quot;lawyer's
                  lawyer,&quot; a fact which should give all members of the profession
                  pause.<br>
<br>
                  Of course, as always, we must remember that Hollywood is making
                  entertainments, not giving us a realistic picture of how large
                  firm lawyers actually conduct their practices. Still I believe
                  the hero/villain manner of portraying lawyers in movies corresponds
                  at some level with a human need to see justice done. Furthermore,
                  I think these movies are evidence that (also a some emotional
                  level) movie audiences don't think justice is always the most
                  obvious product of the American legal system.. <br>
<br>
                  While the Hollywood version of legal reality is clearly unrealistic,
                  it may provide an important antidote to the law school version
                  which seems to flatten the moral universe of most students, convincing
                  them that just because real world disputes are complicated, there
                  are no &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; sides. All lawyers
                  are technicians. Lawyers defending tobacco companies and lawyers
                  defending the homeless are on a moral par, some just better paid
                  than others. Movies force us to confront the view that good and
                  evil do exist and all lawyers must ask themselves &quot;Which
                  side are you on?&quot;</font></p>
