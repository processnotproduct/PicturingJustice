                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Suffering, as a physical and
                  an emotional state plays a central philosophical role within
                  the conceptions of justice that exist in both Buddhism and Christianity.
                  But even though suffering is intimately tied to the notion of
                  justice in both, the role that suffering plays in regards to
                  each respective religion's notion of justice is extremely distinct
                  from one another. Within the context of Christianity, suffering
                  is often interpreted as stemming from some outside source of
                  conflict. Hence, the Christian conception of the Devil, the incarnation
                  of evil that is the malefactor of all our sinful behavior. As
                  a result of conceptualizing the source of suffering as extending
                  from an outside source in this manner, Christianity attempts
                  to curb this improper behavior with the threat of eternal damnation
                  for those who are seduced by the Devil's temptations. Buddhism
                  on the other hand, conceives of suffering in a very different
                  fashion. For the Buddhist, any suffering that is encountered
                  in his or her life is a direct result of some improper action
                  in which that person has him or herself partaken in. Hence, the
                  Buddhist belief in Karma, the concept that every voluntary act
                  will give rise to some result or reaction. Positive action begets
                  positive results and negative action begets negative results
                  (<a href="#footnotes">1</a>). Thus, unlike Christianity, suffering
                  is not brought about by some external force but is instead a
                  direct effect of something that you have yourself done in the
                  past. Essentially, where Christianity places the accountability
                  for suffering elsewhere, Buddhism endeavors to make the individual
                  completely accountable for his or her actions in the absence
                  of any external scapegoats. The effect of these differing models
                  of suffering amounts to fundamentally different approaches to
                  the goals and administration of justice within each of these
                  varying belief systems. More specifically, where Christianity
                  takes a more punitive approach to the mitigation of suffering,
                  Buddhism proceeds with a much more holistic and compassionate
                  agenda. These differing approaches to justice are made more apparent
                  by undertaking an examination of the analogous cultural artifacts
                  that exist in Eastern and Western culture. In this instance,
                  the relationship between suffering and justice in Buddhism and
                  Christian can be illuminated through a comparison of <i>Ghost
                  in the Shell</i> and <i>Robocop</i>, two films that inhabit a
                  similar cultural space within their respective cultures.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/robocop.jpg" width="150" height="203" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><i>Robocop</i> and <i>Ghost in
                  the Shell</i> are most obviously analogous to one another by
                  the fact that they are both situated in the same, very specific
                  genre; that being the sci-fi cop film. The protagonists of both
                  films are cybernetic law enforcement officers that find themselves
                  in a state of suffering as a result of trying to come to terms
                  with their respective status as partially fabricated human beings.
                  In the exploration of such existential questions each film introduces
                  themes of religion to help address these broad queries. Not surprisingly,
                  the American film, <i>Robocop</i> introduces Christian motifs
                  while the Japanese <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> opts for more abstract
                  philosophies invoking Buddhism. The differing religious undertones
                  of the films are illustrated via each films' treatment of the
                  sources of the protagonists' partially mechanical cybernetic
                  bodies. In <i>Robocop</i> much time is dedicated to establishing
                  the corporation known as OCP as the origin of Robocop's mechanical
                  body. In fact, almost half the film is allotted to determining
                  Robocop's origin and conveying the fact that the creation of
                  Robocop was the result of a malevolent insurgence gaining momentum
                  within the boardroom of OCP. While providing this exposition
                  to the audience the film presents the office tower of OCP, as
                  what could easily be interpreted, as a metaphor for heaven. The
                  OCP headquarters exists as a pristine white walled oasis, the
                  tranquility of which towers and rules over the crime infested
                  dregs of Old-Detroit. The President of OCP is a benevolent and
                  good hearted old man, a God-like figure who struggles to do everything
                  in his power to try and save Old-Detroit from its own criminality.
                  In attempt to accomplish this goal the &quot;Old Man&quot;, as
                  he is referred to in the film, creates Robocop, thus imposing
                  the Old Man's role as the giver of life. Robocop's quest to rid
                  Old-Detroit of its malice eventually leads him to the boardroom
                  of OCP where the heart of this evil is found to exist in the
                  form of Vice President Dick Jones. The deviant Jones intends
                  to usurp power from the benevolent President of OCP, making a
                  direct allusion to Lucifer's attempted coup of heaven in the
                  Old Testament. Thus, <i>Robocop</i> directly grounds the source
                  of the film's conflict firmly within the ambit of Christian religious
                  scripture. <br>
<br>
                  Unlike <i>Robocop</i>, <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> does not find
                  some external source to be the generator of the suffering in
                  the film, but instead internalizes this conflict within the existential
                  angst of the film's protagonist, Major Kusunagi. This emphasis
                  on internal causality over <i>Robocop</i>'s external conflict
                  parallels <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> closely with Buddhist philosophy:<br>
<br>
                  <i>They (Christianity and Brahmanism) all try to find out the
                  first cause and establish a law in which God's power controls
                  everything. But Buddhism advocates that man himself is the real
                  person who is in charge of his own fate, not someone else. </i>(<a href="#footnotes">2</a>)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/ghost.jpg" width="150" height="210" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In
                  <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>, Major Kusunagi suffers as a result
                  of her on-going obsession with the nature of her own being and
                  whether her, almost entirely, cybernetic body exempts her from
                  being human. By foregrounding Kusunagi's mental and emotional
                  suffering as the film's main conflict <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>
                  roots itself directly within the context of Buddhist philosophy
                  which maintains that,<br>
<br>
                  <i>This kind of disharmony between the mind and the self is much
                  harder to overcome than the disharmony of the body. When the
                  body becomes sick, we can cure it with all kinds of medicines.
                  But when the mind is sick, it is not so easily cured&#133; Our
                  mind is our worst enemy. Because we fight with our mind all the
                  time , therefore we suffer.</i>(<a href="#footnotes">3</a>)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Buddhist philosophy directly
                  distinguishes itself from Christianity by identifying suffering
                  as an internal emotional state rather than an external conflict.
                  In this way <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> mirrors the distinction
                  made by Buddhism by internalizing the external conflict found
                  in <i>Robocop</i>, and most other Hollywood movies, and identifying
                  suffering as an individual and internal emotional state.<br>
<br>
                  By establishing an external threat to be the source of suffering
                  in <i>Robocop</i>, the film necessitates this source to be physically
                  removed in order for justice to be done. In <i>Robocop</i> the
                  source of suffering is established to be the corrupt element
                  that exists within the OCP Corporation, which causes a great
                  amount of societal suffering as well as the direct suffering
                  imposed on the film's protagonist. In regards to Robocop, the
                  Corporation has done him an injustice by stripping him of his
                  memory and transforming him into to an inhuman instrument of
                  law enforcement. Within the logic of the film, in order for justice
                  to be done and for Robocop to regain some semblance of his humanity
                  he must first dispose of the source of his suffering by ousting
                  Dick Jones from his position as Vice President of OCP. In the
                  Christian conception of justice those whom act unjustly are dealt
                  with punitively by being sent to hell. Likewise, in <i>Robocop</i>
                  justice can only be done once Dick Jones is punished for his
                  crimes and banished from the white halls of OCP. <br>
<br>
                  In <i>Robocop</i> the protagonist's quest for justice is directly
                  linked to his role as the vindicator of the humanity stolen from
                  him by the malevolent factions of OCP. This is illustrated by
                  the way that the film intricately links Robocop's re-discovery
                  of his humanity with the furtherance of his quest to punitively
                  bring the guilty parties to justice. As such, the closer Robocop
                  gets to punishing Dick Jones the more he finds out about his
                  former self. For instance, the first memories that return to
                  Robocop from his life as Officer Murphy are of him being killed
                  by OCP's minions. Thus, from the start, Robocop's quest to alleviate
                  his suffering and re-gain his humanity are linked to a recollection
                  of the crimes committed against him and a desire to vindicate
                  these actions. The next major step for Robocop towards re-acquiring
                  his humanity occurs when he is caught in a hail of bullets fired
                  at him by his former colleagues on the police department. By
                  formally breaking ties with OCP Robocop marches closer to bringing
                  those responsible for his fate to justice, and in turn marks
                  the first time the audience is shown Officer Murphy's face since
                  he became Robocop. Murphy's face acts as a symbol, not only,
                  of Robocop's break with the establishment and the furtherance
                  of his quest for justice, but also as a symbol of the re-propriety
                  of his humanity as well; once again conveying the idea that punitive
                  justice is required to alleviate Robocop's suffering and obtain
                  justice. It is only after Robocop severs his ties to OCP that
                  he endeavors to inquire into who he was before he became Robocop.
                  However, in this scene Robocop still refers to officer Murphy
                  in the third person, not yet associating himself with Murphy
                  and illustrating that it is not until he punishes Dick Jones
                  that he will be able fully regain his humanity and cease his
                  suffering. In the final scene of the film Robocop finally succeeds
                  in punishing Jones by physically banishing him from the heavenly
                  OCP office tower to the abyss below. It is only at this point,
                  once Jones has been punished, that when asked his name Robocop
                  replies &quot;Murphy&quot;, conveying to the audience that the
                  transformation is complete and through the punishment of Dick
                  Jones justice has been done, suffering has been alleviated, and
                  the protagonist has regained his humanity as a result. Thus,
                  inline with the Christian notion of justice, suffering cannot
                  be alleviated in the film until the individual responsible has
                  been directly punished. It is not until Dick Jones, the Lucifer
                  figure in this Old Testament narrative, is banished to hell that
                  justice is in fact done.<br>
<br>
                  The conclusion of <i>Robocop</i> is a very typical heroic ending,
                  recognizable to anyone familiar with Hollywood conventions. <i>Ghost
                  in the Shell</i>, on the other hand, ends in a manner that is
                  both unconventional and somewhat un-heroic from a conventional
                  Hollywood perspective. Aristotle distinguishes our Western notions
                  of courage and heroism to be antithetical to the emotion of compassion
                  (<a href="#footnotes">4</a>), a distinction which appears to
                  be accurate when assessing why the conclusion of <i>Ghost in
                  the Shell</i> might initially seem un-heroic for a Western viewer.
                  Unlike <i>Robocop</i> where justice is attained by Robocop physically
                  punishing the ones responsible, the ending of <i>Ghost in the
                  Shell</i> is absent of any such confrontations. By internalizing
                  the conflict within the protagonist, the film makes it impossible
                  for Kusunagi to alleviate this suffering by engaging in any sort
                  of heroic confrontation. Rather than having a showdown with the
                  Puppet Master (the main source of physical antagonism in the
                  film) Kusunagi instead shows compassion for his situation, relating
                  it to her own, ultimately causing her to join forces with her
                  former enemy. From Aristotle's Western perspective this compassionate
                  conclusion might be interpreted as cowardly, however this is
                  not the case when it is put into the context of Buddhist philosophy.
                  Buddhist philosophy maintains that &quot;The root of suffering
                  is the &quot;self&quot;-self- attachment, self love and self
                  view&quot; (<a href="#footnotes">5</a>). This is true also of
                  Kusunagi in <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>. Her internal suffering
                  is completely the product of her obsession with herself, and
                  continual questioning of who she is and whether or not she is
                  human. By rooting the Major's suffering internally around her
                  notions of her self the film directly aligns itself with Buddhist
                  philosophy and makes it impossible for justice to be achieved
                  via some physical confrontation as in <i>Robocop</i>. Instead
                  of punishing someone else as in Robocop, Kusunagi sacrifices
                  her own identity and merges with her former adversary in order
                  to alleviate her suffering and achieve justice. This notion of
                  sacrifice is also reciprocated by Buddhist philosophy:<br>
<br>
                  <i>A real Buddhist does not make unreasonable demands from the
                  Buddhas or Bodhisattvas. Instead, he should follow the way of
                  the Buddhist and Bodhisattvas, and be willing to sacrifice himself
                  for all beings.</i>(<a href="#footnotes">6</a>)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Indeed, this is reflected by
                  the ending of <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>. Rather than punishing
                  the Puppet-Master for what he has done, Kusunagi listens to his
                  woes, feels compassion for his plight, and understanding for
                  his cause. As a result, Kusunagi decides to sacrifice her own
                  identity in order to merge with the Puppet-Master to form a new
                  entity. Unlike the punitive approach to justice evidenced in
                  Christianity through <i>Robocop</i>, <i>Ghost in the Shell </i>employs
                  compassion to arrive at a conclusion that is centered around
                  the notion of selflessness. In linking compassion with selflessness
                  <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> again parallels Buddhist philosophy
                  in that &quot;selflessness in Buddhism has the meaning of&#133;
                  great compassion&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">7</a>) . Thus, like
                  <i>Robocop</i>, at the end of <i>Ghost in the Shell </i>the protagonist's
                  suffering is alleviated and justice is done, however, unlike
                  <i>Robocop</i>, the film arrives at its ultimate goal through
                  a doctrine of compassion and self-sacrifice rather than through
                  the direct punitive action taken by Murphy. <br>
<br>
                  Certainly, these films merely act as one example of how suffering
                  plays a role in different religions' conceptions of justice.
                  With that said, these films appear to be quite accurate manifestations
                  of the way that the predominate religions of the films' respective
                  nations of origin tie together notions of suffering and justice.
                  Both films employ almost direct quotations of their respective
                  religious texts and in doing so steep their conceptions of justice
                  and suffering directly in the religious milieu of their distinctive
                  cultures. As such we can directly relate the notions of justice
                  and suffering that arise within the films to be somehow representative
                  of the connections that exist between suffering and justice extant
                  in each religion. In the case of Buddhism and <i>Ghost in the
                  Shell</i> the connection is rooted in compassion and selflessness,
                  where Christianity and <i>Robocop</i>, instead, tie suffering
                  and justice together with notions of vindication and direct punitive
                  action. <br>
