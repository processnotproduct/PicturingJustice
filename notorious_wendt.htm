                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This is the opening scene of
                  Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Notorious</i>.  Ingrid Bergman is Alicia
                  Huberman, the daughter of a convicted Nazi spy. Alicia is a &quot;woman
                  of that sort&quot; - notorious for her drinking, parties and
                  her apparently &quot;loose sexual nature.&quot;  Soon after her
                  father is convicted of treason, she meets a handsome man named
                  Devlin (Cary Grant) at one of her parties in Miami.  But then
                  it turns out that Devlin is a &quot;Federal cop.&quot;  And Alicia
                  knows that because association to her father that she is dangerous,
                  &quot;I hate low underhanded people like policemen, pussyfooting
                  after you.  Because I'm a marked woman, you know.  I'm liable
                  to blow up the Panama Canal any minute now. ..&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">However, Devlin and the feds
                  want her to use her family connections to spy on a ring of neo-Nazis
                  in Rio for the United States.  She is reluctant.  But, they know
                  that she is a patriot.  How do they know - because they have
                  tapped her telephone.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Devlin: &quot;My department
                  authorized me to engage you to do some work for us, it's a job
                  in Brazil.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia: &quot;Oh, go away.
                  The whole thing bores me.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Devlin: &quot;Some of the German
                  gentry who were paying your father are working in Rio.  Ever
                  hear of the I. G. Farben Industries?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia: &quot;I tell you, I'm
                  not interested.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Devlin: &quot;Farben has men
                  in South America, planted there before the war.  We're cooperating
                  with the Brazilian government to smoke them out.  My chief thinks

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia: &quot;Of a traitor?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Devlin: &quot;Well, he thinks
                  you might be valuable in the work.  They might sort of trust
                  you.  And you could make up a little for your daddy's peculiarities.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia:  &quot;Why should I?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Devlin: &quot;Patriotism.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia:  &quot;That word gives
                  me a pain.  No, thank you, I don't go for patriotism, nor --
                  or patriots.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Devlin (leaving the room):
                  &quot;I'd like to dispute that with you.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia:  &quot;Waving the flag
                  with one hand and picking pockets with the other.  That's your
                  patriotism.  Well, you can have it.  She gets out of bed.&quot;
                   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Devlin:  &quot;We've had your

                  six-thirty p.m., January the ninth, nineteen forty-six at Miami
                  Beach, Florida.  Devlin puts the record on the turntable.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Devlin: &quot;Some of the evidence

                  that wasn't used at the trial.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia: &quot;I don't want
                  to hear that.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Devlin: &quot;Relax, hardboard,
                  and listen.&quot;  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The record begins and you can
                  hear Huberman's (her father's) voice:  &quot;...money in it,
                  Alicia.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia's Voice:  &quot;I told
                  you before Christmas I wouldn't do it.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Huberman's Voice:  &quot;You
                  don't use your judgment.  You can have anything you want.  The
                  work is easy.&quot; </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia's Voice: &quot;I'll
                  not listen, father.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Huberman's Voice: &quot;This
                  is not your country, is it?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia's Voice: &quot;My mother
                  was born here.  We have American citizenship.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Huberman's Voice: &quot;Where
                  is your judgment?  In your feelings, you are German.  You've
                  got to listen to me.  You don't know what we stand for.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia's Voice:  &quot;I know
                  what you stand for.  You and your murdering swine.  I've hated
                  you ever since I found out.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Huberman's Voice:  &quot;My
                  daughter, don't talk to me like that.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia's Voice: &quot;Stay
                  on your side of the table!&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Huberman's Voice: &quot;Alicia,
                  put your voice down.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alicia's Voice:  &quot;I hate
                  you all.  And I love this country, do you understand that?  I
                  love it.  I'll see you all hang before I raise a finger against
                  it.  Now, go on and get out of here.  Or so help me, I'll turn
                  you in.  Don't ever come near me or speak to me again 'bout your
                  rotten schemes.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But, this being Hollywood and
                  also because it is Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, they are more
                  than just agents in the spy game fighting against traitors -
                  they fall in love, something that Devlin never considered.  And
                  then comes the news of their (or rather Alicia's) specific assignment
                  - using her feminine wiles and seductive charms on an old friend
                  of her father's, Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains), who was
                  once in love with her, again a surprise to Devlin.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Devlin's boss says, &quot;Sebastian's
                  house is a cover-up for whatever this Farben group's up to here
                  in Rio.  We've got to get Miss Huberman inside that house and
                  find out what's going on there.&quot;  Devlin tells Alicia, &quot;Find
                  out what's going on inside his house, what the group around him
                  is up to, and report to us.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At the American Embassy Devlin's
                  bosses are pleased to know that their  &quot;theatrical plan
                  is working.&quot; They now know that Sebastian's cohorts including
                  Professor Wilhelm Otto Rensler (&quot;one of Germany's scientific
                  wizards&quot; going under the name &quot;Dr. Anderson&quot;)
                  are &quot;experimenting&quot; in Sebastian's house in Rio.  And
                  they have found this out because of Alicia and her charms.  They
                  all know what sort of woman Alicia is.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Beardsley (one of Devlin's
                  bosses),  &quot;She's had me worried for some time.  A woman
                  of that sort.&quot;  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Devlin:  (to Beardsley) &quot;What
                  sort is that, Mr. Beardsley?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Beardsley:  &quot;Oh, I don't
                  think any of us have any illusions about her character, have
                  we Devlin?&quot;<br>
                                <br>
                  Devlin (bitterly ironic):  &quot;Not at all, not the slightest.
                  Miss Huberman is first, last, and always not a lady. She may
                  be risking her life, but when it comes to being a lady, she doesn't
                  hold a candle to your wife, sir, sitting in Washington playing
                  bridge with three other ladies of great honor and virtue.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/notorious2.gif.jpg" width="162" height="123" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Plans
                  go awry when Sebastian asks Alicia to marry him. Prescott (Devlin's
                  boss) asks, &quot;Are you willing to go this far for us, Miss
                  Huberman?&quot; and she says, &quot;Yes, if you wish.&quot; 
                  Barbosa, the local official even glees, &quot;Gentlemen, it's
                  the cream of the jest.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After Alicia and Sebastian
                  return from their honeymoon, Alicia continues her work.  At a
                  coming home party she invites Devlin and the two of them discover
                  the secret of Sebastian and his evil friends - special sand filled
                  with uranium ore.  (Did the CIA recently say that Iraq tried
                  to purchase uranium from Africa?  Which is the MacGuffin?)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sebastian suddenly realizes
                  that not only may Alicia be in love with Devlin, but worse, he
                  is married to an American agent.  If his cohorts find out, Sebastian
                  himself will be doomed.  What to do?  His wicked mother, Madame
                  Sebastian (Madame Leopoldine Konstantin) has the answer, &quot;Let
                  me arrange this one. Listen to me. No one must know what she
                  is. There must be no suspicion of her, of you, or me. She must
                  be allowed to move about freely. But she will be on a leash.
                  She will learn nothing further to inform. She must go, but it
                  must happen slowly. If she could become ill and remain ill for
                  a time, until... &quot;  They begin to slowly poison her.  Can
                  Devlin save her in time?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Made in 1946 just after World
                  War II, <i>Notorious</i> shows the interplay of patriotism and
                  the spy game, love and duty.  As in real life most Hitchcock
                  heroes are not framed in black and white.  Devlin is often seen
                  as cold, while we can easily see Sebastian falling in love with
                  Alicia, and we can also understand Sebastian's doom.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Some have said that <i>Notorious</i>
                  was made only after long discussions between J. Edgar Hoover,
                  Hitchcock and David O. Selznick, because of the delicate times
                  and especially because it dealt with uranium and the atomic bomb.
                   </font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Notorious</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> should be seen because of its all-star
                  cast, the writing of Ben Hecht, the scoring of Roy Webb, the
                  gowns by Edith Head, the incredible cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff
                  and the direction of Alfred Hitchcock.  <i>Notorious</i> should
                  be seen because it shows us Hitchcock's recognition of the conflicts
                  of human nature.</font></p>
