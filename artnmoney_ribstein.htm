                  by Larry E. Ribstein<br>
<br>
                  American movies often seem to be hostile to business.  For example,
                  in the popular film <i>Erin Brockovich</i>, we see PG &amp; E
                  poisoning people and then lying about it.  As many commentators
                  have pointed out, the truth in that film was much murkier than
                  the filmmakers let on.  This perspective is common.  Think of
                  the popular film from the year before <i>Erin Brockovich</i>,
                  <i>The Insider</i>, which featured two common themes - the social
                  harm of large corporations, and their suppression of workers
                  who try to rise above corporate morality.  Or for an even darker
                  view, consider <i>Glengarry Glen Ross</i>. Moreover, we rarely
                  see the other side of the story - business as a provider of beneficial
                  jobs and products.  Films like <i>Other People's Money</i>, or
                  at least Danny DeVito's speech to the shareholders in that movie,
                  are rare.  The bias is especially hard to explain when one considers
                  that it appears in films, like <i>Erin Brockovich</i>, that are
                  made and distributed by large conglomerates. <br>
<br>
                  I have written an <a href="http://home.law.uiuc.edu/~ribstein/ribsteinmovies.pdf">article</a>
                  that attempts to solve this puzzle by analyzing a significant
                  number of films that deal directly or indirectly with business.
                  I conclude that filmmakers are not anti-business but anti-capital.
                   In other words, the artists who make films want a bigger piece
                  of the pie and, more importantly, bridle at the restrictions
                  that the money guys place on their creativity.  One piece of
                  evidence supporting this hypothesis is that worker-owned or controlled
                  firms (e.g., the law firm in <i>Erin Brockovich</i>) pass movie
                  muster, even if these worker-friendly firms are of the bank-robbing
                  variety.  The capitalists in control let their workers get away
                  with this subversive message because they do not care what their
                  films say as long as they're making money. <br>
                   <br>
                  This negative view of capital from the narrow artist's perspective
                  is taking a toll on the general reputation of business and, more
                  important, fuels populist sentiment for more regulation.  My
                  thesis supports letting firms speak in their own defense - that
                  is, dropping or relaxing &quot;commercial speech&quot; limits
                  on the First Amendment. It also suggests that movies' message
                  might change if artists become less constrained by capital, as
                  by the digital revolution that could drastically lowers production
                  costs.<br>
<br>
                  Of course, it may be that there is no bias - that business really
                  is bad. But if you believe that, maybe you're watching too many
                  movies.  If you would like to pursue this subject, I invite you
