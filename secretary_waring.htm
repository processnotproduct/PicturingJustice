                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Although on some levels a kinky
                  love story, the film <i>Secretary</i> is one of the most provocative
                  workplace films ever made. Most anyone who has ever worked under
                  the supervision of others is familiar with the obsessive boss,
                  the one who micro-manages or compulsively focuses on minute details.
                  Dilbert, the wildly successful cartoon sendup of the modern office
                  environment, mines this behavior for its comic value everyday.
                  Scott Adams, the cartoonist, seems to get most of his material
                  from the actual work experiences of his readers, who are encouraged
                  to send him material. <i>Secretary</i> shows how deep the veins
                  of workplace torture go through its dogged pursuit of the depths
                  of sadomasochism (S&amp;M) found in one boss/subordinate relationship.
                  The film sheds new light on dominance behavior in the workplace.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/secretary.jpg" width="122" height="186" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The possibility that a supervisor's
                  neurosis can sometimes fit in with personality dysfunctions of
                  subordinates is not virgin territory. Yet, this film challenges
                  modern boundaries by presenting its heroine as a special case,
                  a former mental patient whose illness is far worse than her submission
                  to the obsessive domination of her boss. In this way, the viewer's
                  perception of his cruelty is blunted. What is left is a fantastical
                  story of how two dysfunctional people sometimes find compatibility
                  in an office setting.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Secretary</i> has two legal angles. The first is that the
                  boss, played by James Spader, is a lawyer, and evidences the
                  barely repressed anger stereotypical of lawyers. The second is
                  that his methods of controlling his secretary, played by Maggie
                  Gyllenhaal, quickly take on the dimensions of sexual harassment
                  that all too frequently pervade relations between domineering,
                  successful men and struggling, young women trying to make a living.
                  The extreme metaphor of S&amp;M starkly highlights the power
                  dynamics of workplace sexual harassment. This film ought to be
                  part of any course or program intended to prepare lawyer for
                  the challenges of running a practice without trampling the self-respect
                  of their staff.<br>
<br>
                  Early on, the film visually hints that the lawyer may be domineering
                  and cruel to subordinates. The first tip-off to the lawyer's
                  personality is the &quot;trophy&quot; corridor leading to his
                  door, complete with designer lighting, and the dark, power decor
                  of his office. The second clue is his permanent &quot;Secretary
                  Wanted&quot; sign, surrounded by a border of lights that can
                  be switched on and off like a motel vacancy sign, suggesting
                  that high turnover is routine.<br>
<br>
                  This unconventional romantic fantasy skirts some real world problems.
                  For example, although the secretary quickly grows to need the
                  abuse dealt by her boss, deliberately making mistakes to bring
                  on his wrath, off screen that perception is a huge part of the
                  problem in abusive situations. Often, the abuser is somehow convinced
                  that the victim wants the abuse, just as many child molesters
                  persuade themselves that their victims invited the abuse or will
                  find it beneficial. The fact that it is not welcome does not
                  seem to enter some abusers' minds.<br>
                   <br>
                  If the harassment portrayed in this film were to have led to
                  litigation with consent as a defense, it would becomes the task
                  of the adjudicator to examine the facts and decide whether the
                  defendant's perception of consent was reasonable under the circumstances.
                  The appeal of the lawyer's abusive behavior to a former mental
                  patient might be understandable, but it might not be reasonable
                  because he knew that she was unusually susceptible to abuse.
                  At two points during the film, the lawyer realizes he has crossed
                  the line and tries to end the relationship. In both instances,
                  her need proves stronger than his self-control and it literally
                  forces his hand.<br>
<br>
                  The film does illustrate one way that lawyers should realize
                  they have a problem. If their former employees must compensate
                  for the loss of their jobs by answering S&amp;M ads in the newspaper,
                  perhaps the work environment could use some restructuring.</font></p>
