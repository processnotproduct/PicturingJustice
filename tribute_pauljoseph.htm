                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">We are saddened to note the
                  passing of Picturing Justice managing editor and webitor Paul
                  Joseph, Professor of Law and Associate Dean at Nova Southeastern
                  Law School. Paul died of cancer after a short illness.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In his role as managing editor
                  during its formative years, Paul was largely responsible for
                  Picturing Justice's success. But as we honor him for his intelligence
                  and dedication, it is Paul's warmth and humor we will sorely
                  miss. Our sympathy goes out to his wife Lynn, also a professor
                  at Nova Southeastern, his children, and his granddaughter Abigail,
                  of whom he was very proud.<hr align="LEFT"></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Goodbye Paul.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Paul Joseph is gone. Everyone
                  who enjoys this website has suffered a big loss because Paul
                  was one of the creators of Picturing Justice and his enthusiasm
                  kept the site going through thick and thin.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Paul was a pillar of the Law
                  and Popular Culture movement, the co-editor of <i>Prime Time
                  Law</i> (the only reference book on legal television series).
                  Paul loved to explore the by-ways of pop culture, finding interesting
                  and serious legal issues which everyone else overlooked. Few
                  took <i>Ally McBeal</i> seriously as a law show. Paul did. Few
                  thought about discussing the legal issues and bureaucratic institutions
                  in <i>Harry Potter</i>, but Paul and Lynn Wolf did. Few cared
                  about law and lawyers in science fiction, but Paul did. Nobody
                  regarded <i>Pleasantville</i> as a treatise about freedom and
                  democratic values, but Paul did.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I came to know Paul when he
                  invited me to serve as a visiting Goodwin lecturer at the Shepard
                  Broad Law Center at Nova Southeastern University a few years
                  ago. It was a great experience, meeting the Nova students and
                  faculty and seeing how many of them were interested in and attracted
                  by the collision of law and pop culture. Best of all was the
                  opportunity to get to know Paul and Lynn personally. Their warm
                  hospitality was unforgettable.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Paul and I planned to collaborate
                  on a book to facilitate the teaching of the law and pop culture
                  interface in both undergraduate and law school environments.
                  He wrote parts of it, although conflicting commitments forced
                  him to drop out. That book will be published early in 2004, but
                  Paul won't be here to enjoy the event or to use the book in his
                  own teaching.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Shockingly, Paul Joseph is
                  gone. Brain cancer doesn't respect youth, talent, or human worth.
                  Paul was diagnosed with cancer, and not very long after, he was
                  dead. I have lost a good and decent friend and collaborator.
                  Our field of law and popular culture has lost one of its most
                  devoted and most imaginative scholars. So I take this opportunity
                  to say goodbye and farewell to my good friend Paul Joseph. <br>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I first met Paul via email
                  when he and Bob Jarvis were putting together a set of essays
                  on law and television that later became <i>Prime Time Law</i>.
                  I was just getting started in legal academia and I sent in my
                  expression of interest fully expecting to hear, at best, &quot;Thanks
                  but who are you?&quot; Instead he and Bob invited me into the
                  wonderful world of legal scholarship and treated me as an equal,
                  though I contributed much less to the project than I got out
                  of it, including what is now apparently a permanent identification
                  with the critique of pop culture women lawyers! In subsequent
                  conversations and emails and in person, Paul helped me make what
                  was for professional reasons a more than usually difficult transition
                  into law professoring. He probably knew how important that was
                  to me; that he made it important to himself was more than I could
                  have expected.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I doubt that Paul Joseph ever
                  knew just how much he helped those of us who needed to talk to
                  him, whether just for a quick &quot;pick me up&quot; at a difficult
                  or confusing time, or as in my case for a much longer term. He
                  was ever generous with his ideas, with his enthusiasm, with his
                  certainty that if you work at something with enough energy and
                  commitment you will get the results you desire. And he was ever
                  willing to help out those of us with &quot;impossible dreams.&quot;
                  He was wise, he was funny, and he was with us for much too short
                  a time. His presence was precious and his absence hurts. To his
                  wonderful wife Lynn and his family, please know, if you need
                  me, I am right here.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Christine Corcos<hr align="LEFT"><br>
<br>
                  My favorite memory is watching Paul devour an ice cream cone
                  one weekend at Disneyworld. I was going back to the hotel and
                  a book on popular culture, but Paul and Lynn were living it.
                  He told me that he had spent a lot of time at Disneyland while
                  growing up in the LA area and had always enjoyed the atmosphere
                  of fun and imagination he found there. And the fantasy world
                  of Disney did seem an appropriate setting for Paul since he was
                  more than any law professor I have ever met able to retain that
                  sense of wonder and play most of us lose after childhood.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This sense of fun also was
                  a great asset to Paul in his business dealings. I can not remember
                  even one harsh word (or thought) in my years of dealing with
                  Paul during his tenure as Managing Editor of PJ. Since this is
                  a singular occurrence in my professional life, I have to credit
                  it to Paul's optimistic temperament and supportive manner. No
                  matter the issue, you always felt Paul was on your side and that
                  things would work out for the best. I'll miss him.<br>

                  I truly enjoy the site and it's sad to see one gone with so many
                  years left to experience and share.<br>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I did not have the chance of
                  meeting Paul in person, but we corresponded extensively by e-mail
                  from the moment I started as the webmaster for Picturing Justice.
                  When he heard about my plans to give the site a new look, he
                  was very supportive and enthusiastic and contributed his ideas
                  and opinions until every part of the site was as good as we could
                  make it. He also put a lot of his time and energy into encouraging
                  new authors to write for the site and keeping it dynamic and
                  current.<br>
<br>
                  When he announced that for health reasons he would no longer
                  be the managing editor, I had no idea how bad his condition really
                  was, and that there would not be any more e-mails. I will miss
                  his enthusiasm, ideas and good humor.<br>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I am deeply shocked and saddened
                  by the demise of Mr. Paul Joseph. I have never met him, and the
                  only contact I have was through this site- wherein he helped
                  me, rather encouraged me to publish my work in Picturing Justice.
                  He build in me a confidence to go ahead- his words of encouragement
                  really boosted my morale. thanks Mr. Joseph, may your soul rest
                  in peace.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I had the honor of meeting
                  Paul and Lynn when they came to a conference on law and popular
                  culture at my law school, the University of Arkansas at Little
                  Rock. To me, Paul was a figure larger than life. I was a relatively
                  new law teacher and a green scholar, and Paul was a prolific
                  writer whose work in law and culture I had read and deeply admired.
                  Yet Paul was anything but aloof; I was struck by his warmth.
                  When I presented my research in the conference, Paul's was one
                  of those faces in the audience you go back to, because he was
                  paying careful attention, and smiling and nodding encouragement.
                  After the program, Paul said a few words to me about how he found
                  my research promising, and he encouraged me to continue my work
                  in the area. His kindness to give me his attention and his confidence
                  in me were inspirational, and I will always be grateful for that
                  inspiration. I will remain grateful as well for what Paul has
                  given us all in his life and work.<br>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At the time Paul Joseph died,
                  I was 3000 miles away watching the most adored legal film of
                  all time: <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>. Losing Paul to cancer
                  seems to me like killing a songbird -- a tragic wasting of one
                  of God's finer creations.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Picturing Justice website
                  of which Paul was such an integral part, began as a labor of
                  love by John Denvir and me. As we struggled to help our creation
                  to take wing, Paul Joseph suddenly materialized out of cyberspace
                  and asked John if he could join our effort. What fortunate occurrence
                  that was. (We should have known instantly, given he shared his
                  initials with the web site.) Paul gave his enthusiasm and marketing
                  savvy, and soon thereafter took over as managing editor. He got
                  Picturing Justice on email list serves and in newsletters. In
                  short, he got us a buzz. With Paul at the helm, we were praised
                  in the New York Times and had bragging rights as the best site
                  for law and popular culture.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Paul was a caring and thoughtful
                  innovator. He wrote a commentary on the ethical and moral issues
                  posed by Ultima, a competitive online fantasy game. He saw the
                  contemporary political importance of the discrimination metaphors
                  in the retro 50's film Pleasantville and wrote passionately about
                  them.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I followed Paul's fight against
                  cancer through of number of long telephone conversations. In
                  one I most vividly remember, I was hiking to the top of a mountain
                  with a cell phone and we shared the vista together. He remained
                  optimistic and believed that he would be back on line and in
                  the classroom someday. Paul is on line; his spirit permeates
                  Picturing Justice and corses through the Internet as viewers
                  see each new article. He is in many classrooms that make use
                  of the site. For example, I now teach a course on law and popular
                  culture inspired by Picturing Justice and using a textbook written
                  by fellow PJ webitor Michael Asimow. Paul made it all possible.</font></p>
