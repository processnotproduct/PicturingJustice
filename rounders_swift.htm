                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">One can hardly turn on the
                  television these days without turning to a televised poker game.
                   Other than shows about forensic investigators, they are the
                  most prevalent programs (a show where crime scene investigators
                  play poker seems inevitable).  High-stakes poker is a game that
                  has always attracted lawyers, perhaps because many of the skills
                  of a good lawyer are transferable to the poker table: quick calculations,
                  decisive decision-making, and the ability to &quot;read&quot;
                  another human being.  And many top poker players have legal backgrounds,
                  perhaps epitomized by patent lawyer (now former patent lawyer)
                  Greg &quot;Fossilman&quot; Raymer, who won $5 million as the
                  2004 World Series of Poker champion.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/rounders.jpg" width="112" height="169" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">It
                  was perhaps not surprising then that the 1998 movie <i>Rounders</i>
                  - which certainly helped to propel the interest in poker - included
                  a legal subplot.  At the start of the film, set in New York City,
                  the lead character, Michael McDermott (played by Matt Damon),
                  is a &quot;rounder&quot;, someone who makes a living by playing
                  in lower stakes poker in.  After he loses his full bankroll ($30,000)
                  to a Russian card room operator nicknamed Teddy KGB (played by
                  John Malkovich), McDermott gives up poker to attend law school
                  and appease his girlfriend.  While McDermott, of course, returns
                  to playing cards (ostensibly to help a friend pay off a debt
                  to the Russian) and has the requisite finale high-stakes game
                  against Teddy KGB, it is McDermott's role as a law student and
                  his relationship with one of his law professors that provide
                  non-stereotypical portraits new and experienced legal professionals.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Most media portrayals of law
                  students and new lawyers show them to be boundless optimists
                  with a single-minded determination to seek justice.  The reality,
                  however, is that many people enter law school either because
                  they haven't found anything else to do or to please someone else.
                   Here, it is clear that McDermott's heart is not in law school
                  but, his high stake poker dreams having been dashed, he seems
                  to have no other alternative.  He misses meetings with his moot
                  court team and shows up unprepared for the moot court hearing.
                   Despite this, McDermott's live-in girlfriend and fellow law
                  student is pleased by his abstinence from poker, yet keeps an
                  ever vigilant eye on his comings and goings.  Her fears are soon
                  realized as the release from prison of McDermott's best friend
                  soon leads him back to the poker table.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">On the other hand, most media
                  portrayals of experienced lawyers show them to be either disillusioned
                  (Paul Newman in <i>The Verdict</i>), egomaniacal attorneys who
                  treat the law as a vehicle for personal gain rather than justice
                  (Robert Duvall in <i>A Civil Action</i> or Gene Hackman in <i>The
                  Firm</i>) or curmudgeonly law professors (Kingsfield). Here,
                  McDermott forms a bond with Abe Petrovsky, an aging law professor
                  played by Martin Landau.  Petrovsky does not fit the stereotype.
                  Instead, in response to McDermott's question about what led him
                  to the law, Petrovsky speaks of the disappointment his family
                  felt when he decided to discontinue his rabbinical studies, and
                  then speaks of the law as his &quot;life's work.&quot;  Landau's
                  excellent performance convincingly conveys an uncommon sense
                  of passion and honor about spending a life studying and teaching
                  law.  Professor Petrovsky appears to have a genuine concern for
                  McDermott and, presumably, his other students as well.  However,
                  one plot point that is more implausible than anything seen on
                  <i>Star Wars</i> or <i>Star Trek</i> occurs when McDermott asks
                  his professor to loan him $10,000 to help pay off a friend's
                  gambling debt, and the professor agrees.  One would presume that
                  Petrovsky had a line of debt-ridden students waiting at his office
                  by early next morning.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The film even offers career
                  guidance for law students.  In one scene, McDermott delivers
                  some research to Petrovsky's office and walks in on a poker game
                  between Petrovsky and a group of judges and lawyers (a scene
                  which requires any law professor to suspend animation because
                  the professor is gambling in his office and the office itself
                  is at least three times normal size).  McDermott gains the inside
                  track on a summer clerkship with one of the judges by successfully
                  reading what cards each player is holding by watching body language.
                   Yet another networking tool for enterprising law students!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">While <i>Rounders</i> is primarily
                  a part coming-of-age/part look at the poker underground, it's
                  law student/law professor subplot provides a refreshing change
                  from the usual film portrayals.<br>
