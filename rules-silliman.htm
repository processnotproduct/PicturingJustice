      <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="2">By Scott
      L. Silliman</font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2"></font>
      <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Rules of
      Engagement</i> is a deeply disturbing film in many respects--disturbing in
      its treatment of the law of war and also disturbing in its depiction of
      military justice and the court-martial process.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The movie
      opens with vivid scenes of a firefight between US Marines and the Viet
      Cong in 1968 during the Vietnam War, and its visual depiction of Marines
      being killed after being caught in an ambush by the Viet Cong (the scenes
      often being done in slow motion to exaggerate the agony of death) reminds
      one of the now-famous beginning segment in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>. And
      as in that World War II movie, there is a very disturbing sequence in
      which a prisoner of war is summarily executed, clearly in violation of
      both the 1929 and 1949 Geneva Conventions. In <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>,
      it was the execution of several German POWs by the squad sent out to find
      Ryan, while in <i>Rules of Engagement</i> it is the execution by a
      then-Marine lieutenant (Childers) of a captured North Vietnamese radioman
      in the successful attempt to force a captured&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; North
      Vietnamese officer to radio Viet Cong under his control to break off an
      attack on another platoon of Marines (commanded by then-lieutenant Hodges)
      .</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the
      sequence in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> is shown with little consequence or
      attempt to justify what was done, Jim Webb's <i>Rules of Engagement</i>
      uses this 1968 incident (ironically the same year of Lieutenant Calley's
      massacre of Vietnamese civilians at My Lai) as a central thread running
      through the overall fabric of the entire film. In the closing scenes, at
      now-Colonel Childers' court-martial, where he is accused of killing more
      than 80 civilians during an evacuation of the American embassy in Yemen,
      the North Vietnamese officer is called to the stand in rebuttal by the
      prosecution to recount Childers' prior act of misconduct in 1968 as it
      bears on his (Childers') denial of ever having killed non-combatants.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; What is
      troubling is not only the verbal exchange between Childers' defense
      attorney, now-Colonel Hays Hodges, and the North Vietnamese officer in
      which the latter acknowledges that he, were he in Childers' place in 1968
      under those circumstances, would have done the same thing (executed a
      prisoner of war to save his own men), but the clear implication in the
      film that the end justifies the means--that one can violate the law of war
      if there is some perceived good that would come from it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact
      that Childers is acquitted of killing the civilians, following the
      concession on the stand by the North Vietnamese officer, draws a subtle
      nexus which is worrisome to those of us who hold that adherence to the law
      of war is a unilateral obligation, regardless of the circumstances or what
      the enemy does. International Humanitarian Law cannot be situational as it
      is portrayed in this film, and to that extent the film does a disservice
      to those in uniform who train and fight under the rule of law.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as
      disturbing is the film's wholly inaccurate and biased depiction of
      military law and the court-martial process. For example, the film shows
      Colonel Childers learning for the first time about the charges against him
      when he is called in by his Marine major general convening authority to
      receive a copy of the report of the completed Article 32 investigation.
      Military law provides for any accused and his counsel to be present and
      participate in the Article 32 investigation, or to waive it, and even the
      article 32 investigation itself would procedurally follow a formal
      notification to the accused of the charges against him--the &quot;preferral&quot;
      of charges. To suggest, as the film does, that Childers is kept ignorant
      of the charges to be brought against him at a trial to start within two
      weeks is totally ridiculous.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Also
      disconcerting is the film's depiction of a major and a lieutenant colonel
      (both being junior in grade to the accused) as members of the jury panel
      sitting in judgment over Colonel Childers, something which is generally
      precluded by Article 25 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Lastly as
      to procedure, the film shows the military judge announcing the sentence in
      Childers' trial, rather than the president of the court-martial panel as
      is prescribed in the procedure guide for courts-martial.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; These
      procedural inaccuracies in portraying a military trial do not disturb me
      as much as the clear message in the film that the military justice system
      can be used and abused to further a cover-up. A scene in which the
      military prosecutor (a Marine major) meets with the Secretary of Defense,
      the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Commandant of the Marine
      Corps, and the National Security Adviser, with the purpose being to ensure
      a successful conviction at the trial, no matter what tactics are used,
      portrays the military lawyer in an unfair light. In the larger context,
      the whole depiction of military attorneys in this film is somewhat
      demeaning to the professionalism and rigid ethics of those who have served
      and now serve their country.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Rules of
      Engagement </i>may be a popular work of fiction which feeds upon the
      concerns of many moviegoers over our commitment of forces abroad in
      situations such as Somalia or Kosovo, where the distinction between
      combatants and innocent civilians tends to be blurred, but the film is
      very troubling and disturbing not only because of its inaccuracies, but
      also because of its portrayal of the rule of law as situational and not a
      firm and proper obligation on the part of all those who serve in uniform.</font></p>
