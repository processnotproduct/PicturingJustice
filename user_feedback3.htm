            Ms. Corcos suggests, at the first of her review, that The Court
            is a better show than First Monday. But then she proceeds to
            castigate the show, among her laudatory comments, in each of
            the important areas, writing and acting. I believe that The Court
            stands absolutle no chance for survival for one very important
            reason, and Ms. Corcos almost saw it. Sally Fields is a good
            actress. But she is a perrenial teeny-bopper, in spite of the
            fact that she is getting old. Did you see her practice-sitting
            on the bench? She looked the poster girl for bring-your-child-to-work
            day. No matter what writers go to work for her, they cannot possibly
            give her any credibility, especially for the ability to think.
            And the cliche of having Chris Sarandon being the stable force
            on the bench by having him grow his salt and pepper beard - thereby
            making him look like a worn-out old time editor - was just plain
            silly. The Court is a badly written show and is an insult to
            the Supreme Court of the USA.<br>

            Or, it's the stupid writing.<br>
            First Monday has the potential to be a top-rated television show,
            given the stellar cast. I have seen almost all of these actors
            in more supreme quarters over the years, and I know that each
            one is as capable of delivering well-written material, as they
            are of the material they are given here. First, there is no reason
            whatsoever to have James Garner smoking. Not only is this becoming
            a passe prop, but it should be incumbent upon the person considered
            to be the top judge in Ameria to be bright enough not to smoke.<br>
            Regarding the young lawyer/clerks. Their collective existences
            should be downplayed in the face of such potentially high drama.
            Instead we are given dialogue and presentation taken from out-pages
            of the series, Friends. In this setting, who gives a damn about
            the just-barely concealed sexual fortunes of this group of twinkies
            and dolts? Was one of the writers was a Friends writer. The soporific
            portrayal of Justice Novelli by Joseph Montegna matches his title
            portrayal of Spenser, which he took over from the upbeat Robert
            Urich. He slept there, too.<br>
            Why is Charles Durning in and out of a wheel chair? Is this supposed
            to be a comic diversion? Is a comic diversion applicable in stories
            about the Supreme Court of the USA? As if that isn't enough of
            a misuse of a good actor, he is being asked to recite limerick
            doggerel thereby transcending his thought acumen. A positive
            suggestion: When Marcia Clark was a guest, I looked forward to
            her trying her hand at drama. Instead we saw her just standing,
            talking to the court. <br>
            Suggestion: Suppose the dialogue and scenes among the clerks
            was supplanted by scenes of background business with the lawyers
            who are going to present their cases to the court. We could be
            privy to the nervousness, the plans, the strategies leading to
            the arguments that these lawyers will promulgate as they face
            the final judgement. Such scenes would be tossed against the
            back room processes of the justices. My bottom line is that viewers
            have come to see the process of this august group, and should
            be accommodated as they watch justice at work, rather than, in
            the case of the young turks and turkettes, work at justice. It
            may also be that the writing staff should be augmented with one
            or two over 50 years.</font></p>

            as you claim it is, the fact is that it is probably the most

            This is a comment on the article: &quot;Barbarshop&quot; and
            it goes like this: What does the film Barbarshop hve to do with
            the theme of the site which is &quot;picturing justice?&quot;
            There was no correlation in the review to the concept of justice
            at all. We definately need films and all types of media that
            deal with the concept and theme of justice particularly with
            regard to the concept of &quot;race&quot; as experienced in America
            (see below). A Just Society. So long as we continue to view ourselves
            as members of different &quot;races&quot; we can never have a
            truly just society. We are all runners in the same race, The
            Human Race. As individuals and as groups we are all running this
            race differently based upon criteria that has either been established
            for us or that we embrace on our own accord. Those who benefit
            from the status quo, whose position vis-&agrave;-vis the social
            strata permits advantages to be accrued not based upon any objective
            value, but by way of group membership, will be resistant to any
            notion that challenges their basic assumptions. But challenged
            they must be. Likewise those for whom their group identity has
            traditionally placed them in less advantaged circumstances, whose
            &quot;racial&quot; affiliation has overtime become a source of
            strength an axis point for struggle, resistance and protest must
            redefine or reacquire a new perspective. <br>
            To carry that message we need media projects, which are dedicated
            to breaking down cultural barriers. To fostering individual traits,
            which transcend group identity and affiliations. A media, which
            acknowledges differences, uniqueness, values diversity (which
            is after all is a natural occurring phenomena that we constantly
            overlook) yet at the same time focuses on our commonalities,
            shared dreams, shared visions. <br>
            The Human Race is an intercultural journey. The Gavin Media Institute
            supports that notion and seeks to project this idea through its
            programs and services. Race Across America is the major on-going
            initiative to change the meaning of &quot;race&quot; in America
            from one of a pre-determined and concrete state to a participatory
            event, namely human existence. <br>

            I read the review of Bowling for Columbine. Obviously Professor
            Banks gets it! The connection she has drawn in the review of
            Bowling for Columbine is exactly what I was hoping would be picked
            up by the media in its analysis of the film. Until that little
            girl was shot, I had no idea that there was any connection whatsoever
            between these gun nuts and racist folks. By the way I am the
            prosecutor who appears in the movie. As I lecture to local college
            students, it is interesting to see the perplexed faces when a
            white prosecutor talks about the issues of race, guns and law
            enforcement and how I am part of a system that is institutionally
            racist. Professor Banks raises a point which I also made in the
            movie. Gun safety programs seemed aimed at disarming the black
            community while white people run to gated communities encircling
            the inner cities armed to the teeth with automatic weapons. That
            same energy to encourage disarmament of suburbia is non-existent
            even though this is where the ammo is located. In fact, while
            we white people hate to admit it, this is happening across our
            country in nearly every major city. The intellectual fuel of
            the gun movement in America is found with NRA's nutty friends
            in the racist hate movement. Only David Duke and David Horowitz
            could use the killing of a 6 year old school girl to illustrate
            their twisted ideas that it was liberal coddling of black people
            not the reckless storage of firearms that was responsible for
            this senseless killing. It is easy for people to dismiss Michael
            Moore's style as not polite or grating but it is impossible to
            dismiss the things he has discovered with a camera and a microphone.
            The American icon, Charlton Heston is without his script and
            you can see exactly what his real character is for yourself.
            He is a man who seems more interested in his rather strange view
            that America was a product of &quot;old white men&quot; than
            to see what America is today, a melting pot and a beacon to the
            world of hope. The Professor, has done a wonderful job of reviewing
            this film and her observations are right on target.</font></p>

            I believe that the movie did portray her tragedy, but with the
            same concept of you it should have not been told in her perspective.
            She is the one that was murdered and the whole movie should be
            based around the night she died to when Michael was sentenced.
            It is a great movie, but more attention was paid to Michael after
            her death.Thank you for the time and your views. They really
            helped me with my English paper.</font></p>

            I have just finished watching the FILM having just read the BOOK
            in Florence on holiday. The FORMER is one of the least interesting
            and most formulaic thing I have ever seen. The LATTER was one
            of the most playful and clever pieces of American fiction since
            <i>Catch 22</i> or <i>Bonfire of the Vanities</i>. What silly
            people these Hollywood chaps are. I completely agree with your
            article. What a waste of a wonderful thing. I feel cheated. Yours,

            I have not read the book, but intend to. I am retired and a widower
            suffering the same loneliness, daughter marrying out of the faith
            (I am Jewish), few friends left, etc. I'm old enough to have
            seen and treasure film classics. This film, however, is special,
            and has continually (since <br>
            I saw it several months ago) hit home with me. I cannot strike
            it from my mind. The latest real-life incident: The other day,
            I was emptying my file cabinet of proposals and ideas that span
            a lifetime. I had to throw them out, they are dated and useless.
            Immediately, the scene in the film in which Schmidt notices the
            boxes representing his years of contributions to his firm relegated
            to the garbage pile. You've got to be old enough to understand
            the sadness and feeling of futility. More and more, I recall
            how similar the film is to real life -- my life. As an aside,
            my daughter shares my feelings. Even though we treat it lightly,
            we know it is a true depiction we both understand.<br>

            to the family. As well, it cited other films, similar situations
            in other countries and some other information around Evelyn's

            First, thank you for sharing some of the real legal issues involved
            in this case. Very interesting. I agree that the lawyers working
            pro bono seems most heroic, and in fact the world would be a
            better place if more lawyers put their hearts into their cases.
            If there are any on this earth that <br>
            still do that....I have not heard of them. The legal system has
            turned into &quot;he who has the most money for the best lawyer
            wins&quot;. BUT, I think the BEST of the movie begins when Doyle
            gives his explanation of The Holy Family, not consisting of Mary,
            Joseph, and Jesus, but of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And
            then of course how he explains his father raised him with the
            guide of the Holy Spirit. This scene brings together the ultimate
            tear jerker when brought together with the &quot;angel rays&quot;.
            Put those ingrediants together, and you have the perfect excuse
            to grab the tissue box. But not because you're sad, but because
            it brings tears of true joy. Not too many times do you see a
            movie that can make you cry with joy. THAT is a writers dream.
            How many times have you cried because you were so happy? I loved
            it! I also enjoyed your review. <br>

            Evelyn's mother was abused by her husband and that's why she
            ran off - never intending to be away for anything more than a
            couple of days.. but when Doyle threatened her further she feared
            for her life. Several times she visited Evelyn in the orphanage
            - again at risk to her own life.. and thought Evelyn (and the
            boys) would be better off there than with her - she had NO rights
            in Irealnd at that time - women who choose to flee the marital
            home had very few allies either with the law or the church. Also
            it's interesting that despite the fact Doyle had an affair with
            this <br>
            English bar maid he is never criticised for this. Also after
            the court case he LEFT THREE OF THE BOYS IN THE ORPHANAGE FOR
            A FURTHER FIVE YEARS!!!!When Evelyn was reunited with her mother
            years later she was welcomed into the family home and NOT rejected
            for a second time as she claims. Also three of the brothers lived
            with their mother for TWO years - again a fact Ms Doyle seems
            to have forgotten -<br>

            For Mr. Ghosh, Read your comments regarding the film Capturing
            the Friedmans. After reading hundreds of reviews it is refreshing
            to read a review from the perpective of the family in question
            - mine. Every thought you had is entirely correct. I participated
            in the film because Jesse was in prison , being denied parole
            repeatedly, and may never have been released (civil incarceration
            was looming on the NY front). My feeling is that I wish Mr. Jarecki
            had made a film that came down more on the side of innocence.
            his ambivalence does not serve my original goals regarding the
            film. Your readers should know that I agree with every comment
            you made in your article. Thank you for seeing this case in a
            reasonable light. Maybe that is because you are more of an attorney
            than a film reviewer. Thank you, David Friedman</font></p>

            Professor Ghosh, You are a very good writer. I'm not a college
            graduate or even a learned person, but I found your article easy
            to read and understand. I guess I suspected something more difficult
            given you are a Professor of Law. I find it refreshing when people
            of your obvious intelligence write so everyone can understand.
            Well done!</font></p>

            As always, I enjoyed your review. And, as always, I have a couple
            of nits to pick. We all respond to injustice, I think. The only
            distinction is in how encompassing the response is. My son Ben,
            for example, had a highly developed sense of injustice from about
            the age of three. This stemmed from his strong belief that the
            universe was based on the overriding principle of unfairness
            to Ben. He did not extend his concerns about justice to anybody
            else. Most of us respond to injustices done to those in our &quot;group&quot;
            -- whether defined as family, community, tribe, nation, religion,
            etc. Then there are those who are exquisitely sensitive to the
            sufferings of others, including members of other species. I don't
            think your gene is that potent. OTOH, it seems to me, based on
            anecdotal reports only, that many of those endowed with this
            metaphorical gene have significant blind spots. Gandhi, MLK,
            and Che were all -- no pun intended -- pricks toward women. And
            there's that old saying by Tom Paine maybe? about those who have
            great empathy toward human kind in general, but who can't stand
            individual people. I think we can both think of examples from
            CRLA consistent with that observation. And I think of all the
            self-appointed Jewish leaders who insist that our holocaust has
            to be number one. The Ibo and the Tutsis and all the others just
            don't count. Or, their records must have an asterisk. What's
            interesting about the tsunami is that we can all be voyeurs in
            real time. That's something very new. In the past, we might never
            have known about it. Or, if we lived after the invention of moveable
            type, maybe we would have heard about it weeks or months later.
            I know that your review was about the justice thing, but I wish
            you would have at least mentioned the glorious scenery, the Macchu
            Picchu ruins, and the extraordinary faces of the people the boys
            encountered along the way. Aside from its political content,
            the movie is a great National Geographic travelogue.</font></p>

            on cowboy idealism, which I believe was the basis of its popularity
            as a genre: the good winning out over evil, which wasn't necessarily
            done by lawbreakers. That truth rules to create society's sense
            of guilt and innocence has been perhaps lost, especially in the
            legal system. And pent up emotions have been historcally shown
            to be the basis of social upheavals. NPR recently commented that
            the public interest has been declared unconstitutional.<br>

            Just watched the film this morning and went web surfing immediately
            after and found your article. I knew shortly after frank's death
            that justice would not be served in a court of law. It's a sad
            world sometimes and the justice system is not perfect in many
            ways. I feel the final outcome in this movie whether it weighed
            on Franks parent's lives from then on or not or even other parties
            partial to Richard Strout, the kids etc., was the perfect justice
            and I would have done the same thing if I were in the same position
            in a second, pausing only to reflect on how to do it with out
            being caught. Sometimes as we hear in the movies &quot;vengeance
            is a dish best served cold&quot; rules the day for the surviving.</font></p>

            I am in the middle of settling my malpractice suit and read Lee
            Taft's new article in Annals of Health Law regarding apology
            and litigation. A web search led me to your article. I feel encouraged
            that these ideas are expressed by young lawyers and given credibility
            by someone with the stature of Mr. Taft. I have terminal cancer
            and the health system and doctors failed me. I will receive a
            monetary award---but in the face of death the amount seems irrelevant
            in terms of giving this sad event some meaning. I would like
            an apology but have been told that it will not be forthcoming.
            I would like the apology---but more importantly I would like
            to participate in the analysis of what went wrong and have my
            observations heard and respected. Maybe I can contribute to the
            prevention of future mistakes? I will copy this article and send
            it to the people who are involved---but I don't want to force
            anyone into an apology because if it comes it won't feel real.
            Thanks</font></p>

            Hill and agree whole-heartedly that the advertising did not hit
            the nail on the head for this show. Why I have decided to respond
            to your article is because Kevin Hill is being cancelled and
            I was hoping that you could help. I have emailed the UPN network
            and also signed an online petition to try and help save the show
            from cancellation. I was hoping you could do the same and maybe
            write an article asking your readers to help save the show as
            well. I am an African American male and like the fact that we
            are shown in a positive light on Kevin Hill. I appreciate your

            I was wondering exactly how &quot;real&quot; court shows were,
            so I did a search for an article on it. Luckily I found yours.
            The points generated in the article seemed as if they were stolen
            from my mind and displayed in front of me, as if to say &quot;you
            already know the answer.&quot; It was just amazing. I thought
            I was the only one who noticed that the judges were different
            then the baliffs. In a nutshell, great article.</font></p>

            (Not only a credible character but a very fine performance!)
            Surely the filmmakers do not mean for us to sympathize with the
            character. (Empathize maybe.) I don't have a translation for
            Javed Akhtar's poem. The English subtitles paraphrase it, and
            the original is included with the CD booklet. Here is a website
            that transcribes it. http://nileshbabu.com/v2/veer-zaara/. Do
            you know Hindi or Urdu? A friend tells me he liked come of the
            original lyrics better than the ones created for the film. M.

            the violence, and increasingly, the torture, with which mainstream
            media entertains the masses, is shaping, affecting, directing
            our culture. The result is worse for us than a &quot;savage war.&quot;
