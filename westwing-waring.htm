          </font> 
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">There has been much 
            talk, legislation and litigation intended to control corporate campaign 
            and soft money contributions. Absent a constitutional amendment or 
            a dramatic change in the makeup of the Supreme Court, it appears very 
            unlikely that there will be any effective limitation on campaign spending. 
            The candidate and party with the most money will continue to dominate 
            of the airwaves. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The tangled web of 
            soft money groups that influence voters&#146; perceptions<img src="images/gore.JPG" width="158" height="144" alt="gore.JPG (6665 bytes)" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10"> 
            about candidates and issues just got thicker. A broadcast of the NBC 
            show, <i>The West Wing</i>, on the Wednesday preceding the November 
            2000 election, seemed an unprecedented, indirect effort to use a dramatic 
            television series to influence the vote. As background, <i>The West 
            Wing</i> is about a Democratic President and his staff who have backbone 
            and principles. It presents an idealized view of what the Clinton 
            Presidency could have been (or the promise of Gore).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">A number of political 
            observers have said that middle class women are the most volatile 
            and critical group in this election. (Certainly, that group made the 
            difference for Clinton when he ran against the elder Bush in 1992.) 
            While more women are aligned with Gore on issues such as child care, 
            health coverage, abortion and others, many are still angry at Clinton 
            for the Monica Lewinsky scandal and paint Gore with the same brush 
            of dishonesty. The Democrats have responded by emphasizing their policy 
            differences with Bush and by repeated efforts to show the level of 
            passion that still burns in the Gore marriage. (He won&#146;t cheat 
            on his wife!)</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Along comes <i>The 
            West Wing</i> with its November 1, 2000 broadcast. (The night before, 
            the actor playing the President, Martin Sheen, appeared with Al Gore 
            on NBC&#146;s <em>The Tonight Show</em> and at a subsequent campaign 
            rally.) In the episode, the President, who has been told not to have 
            sex by his doctors due to a heart condition, has just been released 
            from that order due to improving health. He and the First Lady frantically 
            rearrange their schedules so that they can heat up the marital bed. 
            They make numerous references to lingerie (&quot;special garment&quot;) 
            that the First Lady is going to wear in order to fan the flames of 
            passion. Did this episode titillate some of its viewers with the notion 
            that lusty Commander in Chief Gore would set a great example for lovelorn 
            marriages across America? Perhaps we&#146;ll know on election day.</font></p>
          <p><img src="images/Bush.JPG" alt="Bush.JPG (8040 bytes)" align="left" hspace="14" vspace="14" width="133" height="158"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Governor George W. Bush has adopted a frequently 
            invoked theme that he is a uniter who can end the partisan bickering 
            in Washington that has characterized most of the Clinton tenure. While 
            some may scoff at this notion, given the scorched-earth politics of 
            Newt and his cronies, it is a message that Gore desperately needs 
            to rebut. In the same <i>The West Wing</i> episode, the President 
            hires a Republican newspaper columnist to work on his staff. When 
            she attempts to stop the divisive tactics of a pair of executive branch 
            staffers who are polarizing Congress, they respond by leaving a misogynist 
            &quot;decoration&quot; in her office. Male members of the White House 
            staff who had earlier doubted the skill and sincerity of this defector 
            from the opposing party now rally around her and the two harassers 
            are fired. The inner-circle staffers thus join her in strong bi-partisan 
            opposition to gender-based workplace harassment (not to mention a 
            rousing chorus from <i>HMS Pinafore</i>). </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Bush has also been 
            making a lot of noise about the sorry state of readiness of the U.S. 
            military, another contention disputed by the Gore camp. <i>The West 
            Wing</i> responded by depicting a confrontation between a retiring 
            general (presumably a Bush supporter) and the White House Press secretary, 
            in which she appears to get the better of him in an argument over 
            the validity of the Pentagon&#146;s definition of military readiness. 
            The President ultimately gets the last word by forcing her to back 
            off from her threat of retaliation if the General publicly speaks 
            his mind, thereby proving that this President, at least, can take 
            the heat.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">I raise my observations 
            not because I am upset by its present manipulation of public sentiment. 
            I am a Gore supporter and grateful for any help he can get. But, fast 
            forward four years. Let&#146;s say George W. is elected and is running 
            for a second term in a close race. His administration has fallen far 
            short of its initial promise, but there is a convenient television 
            show running about a progressive and compassionate Republican President 
            that shows the American public how things could be if they just have 
            faith. You can see the problem.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">I don&#146;t yet know 
            how we sort through this newest, thorny problem of corporate (owners 
            of the networks) influence on elections, but I do know that it isn&#146;t 
            going to go away. Given the show&#146;s popularity, we will likely 
            see more <i>West Wings</i> in our future.</font></p>
