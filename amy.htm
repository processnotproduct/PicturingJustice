        <p><center><strong><font face="Verdana">Judging <i>Judging Amy</i></font></strong></center></p>
        <p><center><font size="-1">By Chris Jackson</font></center></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I should be on my way to Vegas.
        A prediction I ventured back in May has come true (see <i>Picturing
        Justice</i> article, &quot;<a href="providence-jackson.htm">From
        Baltimore to &#145;Providence&#146;: It&#146;s Farther Than You
        Think</a>&quot;).</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At that time, NBC had cancelled
        the steely crime drama <em>Homicide: Life on the Streets</em>,
        and sentimental newcomer <em>Providence</em> was safely ensconced
        among the top twenty shows. My guess was that<img src="images/abrenneman.jpg" alt="Amy Brenneman" align="RIGHT" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="158" height="171" naturalsizeflag="0"> television&#146;s fall lineup
        would include a spate of shows featuring thirty-ish urban professionals
        returning home for a new start. <em>Cincinnati</em> or <em>Phoenix</em>
        might be likely titles. I overlooked <em>Hartford</em>, location
        and secret title of CBS&#146;s <em>Judging Amy</em>. Similar
        to <em>Providence</em>, this show has snappier writing and substitutes
        law for medicine as the main character&#146;s career. Still,
        it&#146;s a softy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The ten-year marriage of corporate
        lawyer Amy Gray (Amy Brenneman) is over. Nominated for a judgeship
        in Hartford County&#146;s Juvenile Court, Amy and her young daughter
        (Karle Warren) flee New York City for the relative quiet of Connecticut.
        The two move in with Amy&#146;s mother, Maxine (the inimitable
        Tyne Daly), a semi-retired social worker. Other family members
        include older brother Peter, a plodding insurance executive,
        Jillian, his dissatisfied wife upset because she can&#146;t conceive,
        and Vincent (Dan Futterman), a struggling short story writer
        running a dog washing business. Vincent&#146;s literary style
        is, according to his agent, &quot;<em>Anne Tyler with testicles</em>.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">What can legal practitioners
        learn from this series? So far the drama&#146;s focus on matters
        of law has been pretty mushy. For Amy, presiding in family court
        is like returning to kindergarten. In early episodes, Amy learns
        when to call a recess and where to sit for lunch (with Maxine,
        of course, who smiles and waves at everyone in the cafeteria).</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It&#146;s hard to believe that
        Judge Gray is a Harvard Law grad with corporate law experience.
        After a family worker&#146;s recommendation to the court, Amy
        asks, &quot;<em>What does that mean?</em>&quot; The woman responds,
        &quot;<em>What part?</em>&quot; Amy says, &quot;<em>All of it</em>.&quot;
        Eventually, Judge Gray suggests that a child&#146;s grandmother
        may be a more suitable caretaker than a foster family. Maxine
        would beam with pride.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Other cases testing Amy&#146;s
        ethical and legislative mettle concern a possible conflict of
        interest, a defendant claiming multiple personality disorder,
        and a violent juvenile offender. One of her decisions is appealed.
        Judge Gray has yet to cite any precedents or display legal knowledge.
        The four or five shows I&#146;ve seen avoid actual rulings and
        are long on continuances.</font></p>
        <p><img src="images/cast.JPG" alt="Judging Amy cast" align="LEFT" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="215" height="232" naturalsizeflag="0"><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Every episode&#146;s
        credits end with a clip of Amy scampering down a hall, judicial
        robe floating behind her. The shot is a mirror image from that
        saga of teen angst, <em>My So-Called Life</em>. Amy&#146;s professional
        world of the courthouse is only high school, and all these new
        people are just cliques in the cafeteria. For courtroom role
        models, better watch <em>The Practice</em> or Sam Waterston and
        Angie Harmon in <em>Law and Order</em>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Spiritual guidance, however,
        is the series&#146; strong suit. This is a show in search of
        wisdom rather than justice. The biggest burden on Amy&#146;s
        shoulders seems to be balancing professional duties with personal
        responsibilities. Ironically, Amy becomes a judge in family court
        just as her own marriage is crumbling. Prior to being sworn in,
        Amy faces her precocious daughter, Lauren.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Amy: <em>This judge thing is
          really cool but the most important job I&#146;ll ever have is
          being your mom. [pause for effect] How was that?</em></font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Lauren: <em>Pretty good. Now,
          let&#146;s get sworn in</em>.</font></p></blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Living with Mom and other family
        members represents another challenge for Judge Gray. Like &quot;<em>Providence</em>,&quot;
        the show brims with babies and dogs. In some of the at-home scenes,
        the sap flows freely.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bing bong. &quot;<em>Now, who
        comes to visit at dinner time?</em>&quot; Maxine asks, but we
        already know. Yes, it&#146;s the angry mother who abandons her
        adorable baby on Maxine&#146;s doorstep. This happens just in
        time to give the childless Jillian a taste of child-rearing.
        Who wouldn&#146;t love this big old house filled with wacky relatives?
        Even the dorky older brother shows his warm side when he and
        Vincent go out for some brewskys.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Despite cornball plots and
        soft-focus shots of family portraits, the dialogue at home includes
        some spice. After Amy and Maxine fight, Vincent tells Amy to
        ease up.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Vincent: <em>C&#146;mon. Throw
          Mom a bone.</em></font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Amy:<em> She doesn&#146;t want
          a bone; she wants the whole cow.</em></font></p></blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In another scene, Maxine&#146;s
        ham-handedness leaves only her and Vincent at the dinner table.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Vincent: <em>You sure know
          how to clear a room.</em></font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Maxine:<em> It hasn&#146;t
          worked on you yet.</em></font></p></blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Unlike the guardian angel mother
        in <em>Providence</em>, Amy&#146;s sage matriarch is all too
        alive. Her home is a sprinkler system of wisdom. Even the family
        dog&#146;s name is Socrates. When Jillian leaves Peter and moves
        in with Maxine, Mom spins out a little homily. &quot;<em>Jillian,
        did you let Socrates out by himself? You should go with him.
        Then he will do what he needs to do.</em>&quot; Translation:
        Go back to Peter.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Maxine&#146;s goal is to show
        her offspring how to be adults. Her advice to Amy about being
        a judge? &quot;<em>Pee before you take the bench, and make sure
        there&#146;s no food in your teeth. Trust your instincts.</em>&quot;
        You never heard such tasty tidbits in law school. Armed with
        these truths, who needs LSATs and mock trials?</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">My crystal ball is ready with
        its next prediction: a three-five year run for <em>Judging Amy</em>,
        despite a time slot opposite ABC&#146;s <em>NYPD Blue</em> starting
        in January. Sharp writing and fine acting make the show appealing.
        There are already indications that Amy on the bench is wising
        up, and Maxine will display more vulnerability. The ethos that
        family must be preserved is a sea change from other crime and
        cop dramas. &quot;Amy&quot; is comfort food for tired, hungry
        professionals who feel adrift in the career world. They can watch,
        learn a little something about how to survive mistakes, and feel
        secure with Maxine&#146;s wisdom that &quot;<em>There are no
        formulas</em>.&quot;</font></p>
