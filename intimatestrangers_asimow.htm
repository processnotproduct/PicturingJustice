                  <i>INTIMATE STRANGERS</i></font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Anna (the ravishing Sandrine
                  Bonnaire) is a troubled woman who makes an appointment with a
                  psychotherapist for a late afternoon visit.  By mistake she wanders
                  into the office of William (Fabrice Luchini), a tax lawyer down
                  the hall from the therapist.  Anna begins telling William about
                  her marital problems and he is too fascinated and embarrassed
                  to stop her.  Even after Anna discovers that she's confiding
                  in a tax lawyer rather than a therapist, she continues their
                  consultations.  Thus begins Patrice Leconte's delicious movie
                  <i>Intimate Strangers</i>, an unclassifiable film that falls
                  somewhere between the mystery, film noir, and romantic comedy
                  genres.   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/intimatestrangers.jpg" width="182" height="122" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">This
                  review won't dwell on the superbly etched minor characters, such
                  as Dr. Monnier, the real therapist who looks a tad like Freud
                  and never overlooks the bottom line; Mme. Mulon, William's bossy
                  secretary; Marc, Anna's equally troubled husband; and Jeanne,
                  William's ex-girlfriend.  Looking just at Anna and William, why
                  in the world would a woman who has no tax problems confide her
                  most intimate secrets to a tax lawyer?  Granted, William's a
                  lot cheaper than Dr. Monnier (actually he's free), but on the
                  other hand he isn't exactly qualified to give marital advice.
                   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The situation is comic, of
                  course, but it is not absurd.  In fact, lawyers act as therapists
                  much of the time. When engaged in legal work, they often have
                  to act therapeutically, for example by cooling down clients who
                  are emotionally over-involved in disputes or by getting them
                  to face reality in considering a settlement proposal or a plea
                  bargain. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Lawyers also frequently furnish
                  non-legal advice about personal matters, business or investments,
                  or estate planning.  They are often called upon to listen sympathetically
                  to their client's non-legal troubles, sometimes to their entire
                  life stories. Lawyers must be good listeners and they are rewarded
                  as much for their good judgment as for their professional knowledge.
                  Lawyers, after all, are professional problem solvers. Sometimes
                  they're paid just to be a friend-a sympathetic yet objective,
                  resourceful, and not overbearing friend.(<a href="#1">1</a>)
                   William observes that he's consulted about birth, marriage,
                  death, and divorce all the time.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Lawyers and therapists have
                  the same obligation to protect the confidentiality of the client's
                  secrets.  In fact, as Dr. Monnier points out, therapists and
                  tax lawyers have a lot in common-their clients must decide what
                  to declare and what to hide.  So it's not so surprising that
                  Anna would find that she is deriving benefit from her consultations
                  with William, who in fact turns out to be a pretty good therapist.
                  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But why would William want
                  to listen to all this?  He's a busy professional, surely, and
                  we see several scenes in which he has to blow off paying clients
                  in order to meet with Anna.  Well, it's titillating, of course,
                  and soon he feels an intense sexual attraction to Anna-although
                  this review won't disclose whether their relationship is ever
                  consummated.   But it's also true that William is really a dork.
                   His relationship with Anna-which is confined to her talking
                  and him listening-is far and away the most satisfying thing in
                  his life.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It's been said of tax lawyers
                  that they are good with numbers but don't have enough personality
                  to become accountants.  And so Leconte must have made William
                  a tax lawyer because it was very dorkiest profession he could
                  think of.  Certainly, tax lawyers and accountants in the movies
                  are usually terminal nerds.  This was true of Robert Tracey (Jack
                  Lemmon) in <i>Phffft!</i> (1954); Robert is a nerdy tax lawyer
                  who gets a date with his future wife by offering to fill out
                  her tax return.  Certainly it's true of accountant Leo Bloom
                  (Gene Wilder) in <i>The Producers</i> (1968).  Bloom falls somewhat
                  short in the personality department though he's pretty strong
                  in the creativity department. Government tax inspector Ryoko
                  Itakura (Nobuko Miyamoto) in <i>A Taxing Woman</i> (1987) and
                  <i>A Taxing Woman Returns</i> (1988) was relentless and seemed
                  to have no life other than catching tax cheats. Tax lawyer Stuart
                  Markowitz (Michael Tucker) on <i>L. A. Law</i> (1986-94) was
                  nerdy but loveable. Stuart took over as the firm's chief tax
                  lawyer after his predecessor was found dead with his face in
                  the CCH Tax Reporter when the staff came in on Monday morning.(<a href="#2">2</a>)  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Of course there's one major
                  exception to the rule that tax specialists in pop culture are
                  dorks.  The tax lawyers in <i>The Firm</i> (1993) weren't dorky.
                   They were either murderous crooks fronting for the mob (such
                  as Gene Hackman and Hal Holbrook) or greedy, over-achieving young
                  associates (Tom Cruise).  Indeed the film (and Grisham's  book)
                  might suggest to some that tax law and organized crime are the
                  same thing.(<a href="#3">3</a>)  But William, in <i>Intimate
                  Strangers</i>, is as dorky as they come.  He definitely won't
                  inspire law students with the longing to specialize in tax law.
                   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">William is pathetically repressed.
                   He inherited his tax practice from his father.(<a href="#4">4</a>)
                   He continues to work, and to live, in the same gloomy flat that
                  his father owned.  He even inherited his father's busybody secretary.
                   Jeanne, his ex-girlfriend, dumped him for a musclebound moron.
                  He is pathologically unable to make the first move with a woman.
                  There is nothing going on in his life except his tax practice,
                  nothing at all. Thus the mysterious Anna is a gift from heaven.
                  Who knows if she is telling the truth about her husband? Who
                  cares?  For William, his &quot;therapy&quot; sessions with Anna
                  make life worth living. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Well, speaking as a former
                  accountant and a former tax lawyer, and more recently a  tax
                  law professor, I really loved this movie.  OK, I wouldn't want
                  to emulate William's personality or his rather dreary law practice,
                  but I admired his ability to serve as a loyal friend, confidant,
                  and adviser to a beautiful and troubled woman.  It isn't <i>Revenge
                  of the Nerds</i> (1984) exactly, since William doesn't get revenge
                  against anybody, but he wins some important personal victories
                  as the story spools out. The film is a satisfying tribute to
                  the simple pleasures of dorkdom.  <hr align="LEFT">  </font><a name="1"></a><font size="-2" face="Verdana">1. See Charles Fried,
                   <i>The Lawyer as Friend: The Moral Foundations of the Lawyer-Client
                  Relation</i>, 85 Yale L. J. 1060 (1976). <br>
                    </font><a name="2"></a><font size="-2" face="Verdana">2. And
                  there have been other rather dysfunctional tax specialists, 
                  including characters in <i>Ghostbusters II</i> and <i>Ordinary
                  People</i>.  See Erik M. Jensen, <i>The Heroic Nature of Tax
                  Lawyers</i>, 140 U. Pa. L. Rev. 367, 369 (1991), which hails
                  <i>The Firm</i> as the great breakthrough for the image of tax
                  lawyers.<br>
                    </font><a name="3"></a><font size="-2" face="Verdana">3. The
                  abysmal quality of law and accounting practices in the area of
                  tax shelters in the last few years could well strengthen this
                  analogy.   <br>
                    </font><a name="4"></a><font size="-2" face="Verdana">4. Perhaps
                  this was intended as a nod to the father-son law firm on <i>The
                  Defenders</i> (1961-64), the greatest of all TV lawyer shows.
