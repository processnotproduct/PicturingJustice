      <p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The stunning series of body
      blows delivered to the American body politic by the courts and
      elected officials responding to the debacle of the 2000<img src="pres.JPG" border="0" align="RIGHT" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="158" height="121" naturalsizeflag="0">
      presidential election in Florida may now be grinding to a close
      as the United States Supreme Court, in a closely divided opinion,
      essentially said that time had run out&#150;that there was no
      time to fix the recount problems. There will be a new President
      but many will forever doubt that he actually received the most
      votes in Florida.</font></p>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There will be many attempts
      to explain what went on in this ill-starred election. One recurrent
      theme will undoubtedly be how far-fetched and unlikely it all
      was. &quot;Nobody could have foreseen this.&quot; Aaron Sorkin,
      creator of <u>The West Wing</u>, was recently quoted as saying
      that if he had created a show with this plot, he couldn&#146;t
      have sold it &quot;to the fantasy channel.&quot; Yet, Hollywood,
      perhaps because it combines an infinite imagination with a willingness
      to assume both the best and the worst about human behavior, has
      managed not only to predict something similar to this morass
      but also to foreshadow a number of other political and other
      disasters. It turns out the entertainment industry has been writing
      scripts that presage the 2000 election since at least 1948. In
      that year John Huston filmed <u>Key Largo</u> (script by journalist
      Maxwell Anderson), which explains Florida election politics succinctly.</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">&quot;Let me tell you about
          Florida politicians. I make them. I make them out of a whole
          cloth just like a tailor makes a suit. I get their name in the
          newspaper, I get them some publicity and get them on the ballot.
          Then after the election we count the votes and if they don't
          turn out right, we re-count them and re-count them again until
          they do.&quot; (Edward G. Robinson to Humphrey Bogart).</font></p></blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Hollywood both draws from real
      events and weaves fantasy extrapolations in ways which have presaged
      the future. For example, the same corruption scandals which plague
      real politics have already been scripted in a number of films.
      <u>A Lion is in the Streets</u> (1953) in which a barefoot boy
      from the bayou rises to political prominence, is based on a novel
      by Adria Locke Langley. <u>Lion</u> doesn&#146;t simply echo
      Huey Long; it predicts some of the accusations leveled against
      bayou-born Edwin Edwards, 4-time governor of Louisiana, who was
      finally convicted of a crime after the government&#146;s fourth
      attempt. And it looks as though he&#146;ll get a new trial on
      that case, based on a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The South
      will rise again.</font></p>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In 1979's <u>The China Syndrome</u>
      Hollywood postulated that corruption in the nuclear power industry
      could cause an atomic meltdown. Three Mile Island made the meltdown,
      if not the reason, come true. 1990's <u>By Dawn&#146;s Early
      Light</u> suggested that the presidential succession statute
      might lead to an unprepared Cabinet member (the Secretary of
      Agriculture) becoming President and then refusing to give up
      power. That succession statute has received a much higher level
      of popular scrutiny since newscasters and politicians have speculated
      on who might take over in January if neither Bush nor Gore wins
      the election outright.</font></p>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Of course, much of the scandalous
      material that underlies films like these comes from the wealth
      of underground knowledge that insiders of any profession have
      and are willing, for a price, to reveal. Coupled with the &quot;what
      if&quot; scenarios beloved of many of us, this knowledge leads
      to exciting but theoretically unbelievable stories. Consider
      the comments of NPR reporter Bob Mondello. &quot;Two politicians
      locked in a battle that is, as Dan Rather might say, 'tighter
      than Spandex.' The popular vote goes one way, the Electoral College
      is leaning the other and the whole shebang hinges on a single
      state. Not a bad Hollywood setup as these things go....But just
      then ... the screenwriter adds about five too many plot twists...
      He has to make the governor of that state the brother of one
      of the candidates, like anyone's going to believe that. And then
      he puts that brother's candidate ahead by a razor-thin margin,
      then he adds a recount...on top of which he piles questions about
      the way the ballot was laid out...[and] missing ballot boxes.
      And just to complicate things...&nbsp;he throws in a newly elected
      Congress divided so evenly that you'd have to be a soothsayer
      to guess how things would come out. I mean, come on... Talk about
      the tail wagging the dog...&quot; (ALL THINGS CONSIDERED (9:00
      PM ET)November 10, 2000, Friday).</font></p>

      <p><u><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Wag the Dog</font></u><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> (1997) features a Hollywood director
      who<img src="wag.JPG" border="0" align="RIGHT" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="110" height="162" naturalsizeflag="0">
      creates a war in Albania in order to cover up a presidential
      sex scandal. The story was unbelievable until the Monica Lewinsky
      story bewitched us. This film plays with our perceptions of reality,
      suggesting that politics, like the moon landing (<u>Capricorn
      One</u>), not only can be but is created for the benefit of its
      practitioners (shades of Plato&#146;s Cave!) Small wonder that
      large parts of our population believe in conspiracies surrounding
      the deaths of JFK, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Princess Diana
      (see <a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/9505/belief.html">link</a>)&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Increasingly, the line between
      media fantasy and what passes for reality almost seems to blur.
      Coverage of real trials, such as the trial of O.J. Simpson, are
      presented as media spectacles competing with television judges
      such as Judge Judy (now there&#146;s a judge who really knows
      how to cut to the chase and get things done). Recent coverage
      of the election 2000 lawyers have sometimes treated them almost
      like sports figures&#150;even going so far as to compare their
      &quot;won-lost&quot; records. Remember, on any given Monday,
      any legal team can beat any other legal team.</font></p>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In a world where Ronald Reagan
      becomes President (a fact which is met with<br>
      stunned disbelief in the film Back to the Future) and Fred Dalton
      Thompson<br>
      (currently a Tennessee Senator who rose to national attention
      as Senate<br>
      minority counsel during the Watergate hearings) could continue
      his acting<br>
      career after his 1994 election (Baby's Day Out, 1994), maybe
      we should ask<br>
      Hollywood to script an end to the 2000 election. We&#146;ve already
      provided the filmmakers with terrific raw material and, as Pedro
      Calderon de la Barca told us four centuries ago, life is a dream.
      Even the butterfly ballot shouldn&#146;t have surprised us. As
      Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu pointed out, it&#146;s sometimes
      difficult to tell whether you are a human being dreaming you
      are a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming you are a human being.</font></p>
