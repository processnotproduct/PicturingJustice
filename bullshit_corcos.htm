<br>
                  The Penn and Teller Showtime series <i>Bullshit!</i> will be
                  back on the air in April of 2004, spreading the duo's own brand
                  of iconoclasm and debunkery once again. If you don't know them,
                  or haven't seen one of their performances, I can describe them
                  as serious, but not solemn, practitioners of the magical arts,
                  who cheerfully lead their audiences down the garden path and
                  then let them in on some of the secrets of the tricks they perform.
                  They know that people like to be thrilled, liked to be fooled,
                  and like to be mystified; that's the basis of their highly popular
                  and long-running <a href="http://www.lasvegas-nv.com/penn-and-teller.htm">Las
                  Vegas show</a> . The Penn and Teller gimmick is that Penn Jillette,
                  tall, sturdily built and quite imposing, does all the talking.
                  The smaller, more fragile looking Teller (and he does have only
                  one name) says absolutely nothing, but his rubber face expresses
                  a range of emotions as Penn uses him for all sorts of bizarre
                  experiments.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/bullshit.jpg" width="139" height="142" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">So
                  far, so good. But Penn and Teller have a couple of other missions,
                  and one of them is the education of the American public through
                  a Showtime series forthrightly named <i>Bullshit</i>. If you
                  are easily offended, do not watch this series. You will not think
                  it is amusing, or educational, or well-balanced (and you won't
                  think Penn and Teller are well-balanced, either). Don't visit
                  their <a href="http://www.pennandteller.com/">website</a> . Penn
                  and Teller require all the protections of the First Amendment
                  for their writing (bibliography appended below), for their performances,
                  and for their show.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bullshit!</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is dedicated to the proposition that
                  we can all be taken in, at some time or other, by charlatans,
                  fakes, frauds, cheaters, scammers, and bamboozlers. Further,
                  it tries to investigate at what point we should, individually
                  or as a society, put an end to such goings-on and how we should
                  do so. Libertarians Penn and Teller are the last to suggest that
                  the government should limit our freedom to lose our shirts buying
                  into perpetual motion machines, magnet therapy, feng shui apartment
                  re-dos, and telephone calls to Miss Cleo. Their point instead
                  is that if we engage in some critical thinking about the claims
                  we hear, we'll be less likely to lose our shirts (maybe we'll
                  just lose the sleeves). For example, the premiere episode of
                  the 2003 season dealt with &quot;Talking to the Dead&quot;, demonstrating
                  once again that even folks who truly believe that they are psychic
                  are probably deluding themselves. Episode 2 featured a look at
                  &quot;Alternative Medicine&quot;, by which Penn and Teller mean
                  chiropractic as well as reflexology and magnet therapy. Whether
                  or not this stuff works, or relies on the placebo effect, or
                  on the mind-body connection to make you feel better (assuming
                  you do feel better), Penn and Teller suggest, you should at least
                  realize that the science behind many of these approaches may
                  not be rock-solid and some of the claims may be exaggerated.
                  The word on the street is that videos of the first season will
                  be available in early spring, 2004.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">One of the cleverest episodes
                  was &quot;Feng Shui/Bottled water&quot;, in which Penn and Teller
                  show the variability of outcomes of Feng Shui science, depending
                  on the practitioner. Three different Feng Shui designers came
                  up with wildly different room decoration schemes for the same
                  individual and each claimed to be applying some sort of scientific
                  principle. One highly recommended red for the living room to
                  be redecorated because it was good &quot;chi&quot;, another was
                  violently against it because it would invoke bad vibrations.
                  The duo even got one designer on tape saying under his breath
                  after his own rearrangement of the furniture that &quot;It still
                  looks like shit.&quot; The bottled water segment demonstrated
                  that not only is bottled water almost guaranteed to taste the
                  same as tap water, sometimes it is tap water. Why, ask Penn and
                  Teller, pay a dollar or more for a plastic container of H20 that
                  you already pay for through your taxes? And why are there numerous
                  EPA employees charged with monitoring ground water and no EPA
                  employees charged with monitoring bottled water? Because the
                  FDA is in charge of the quality of bottled water. But there's
                  only about one FDA employee in charge of monitoring bottled water.
                  For the whole US. The confusion is consistent and amusing, but
                  it poses some important questions about the nature and extent
                  of government regulation of products offered to the consumer.
                  Penn and Teller, who clearly know that the issue is complicated,
                  drop the issue at that point, and that point is where I see a
                  problem.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The problem that I have with
                  Penn and Teller's show is that the objections they raise to designer
                  water, s&eacute;ances, and a prohibition against second-hand
                  smoke may lead some of their converts to demand the intervention
                  of the law to deal with the problems. Many of the philosophical
                  issues they raise are issues that viewers will ask legislators
                  to deal with as well. To the extent that a legal solution is
                  advisable, Penn and Teller's presentations are too short to explore
                  the pros and cons. They are highly intelligent individuals and
                  clearly understand that answers to questions of fraud and/or
                  self-delusion are not easy, but their enthusiastic devotees may
                  not, and non-devotees who might otherwise be convinced that problems
                  exist may be put off by the simplistic arguments. To the extent
                  that the Penn-and-Teller positions are presented by attractive
                  and articulate folks on the one hand and the anti-Penn-and-Teller
                  positions by befuddled, money-hungry or deranged individuals
                  on the other, the game also seems rigged. But then, Penn and
                  Teller are magicians.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Disappointingly, some of the
                  better arguments consist of logic hidden under four letter words,
                  as if profanity were necessary in order to get the viewer's attention.
                  People who watch <i>Penn and Teller's Bullshit</i> are of two
                  types: the converted and the willing to be converted. Of these
                  two groups, the latter is likely to be put off by the profanity.
                  Of those in the former group, only a few are likely to enjoy
                  lewdness; the others either listen past it, or like me, tire
                  of it very quickly.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Perhaps I am expecting too
                  much of a half-hour show. The hosts can't present all the philosophical,
                  sociological and legal problems attendant on the regulation of
                  products that fall neatly in neither the food, nor drug, or supplement
                  category, for example. That is a regulatory mess that even lawyers
                  don't always understand. The best they can hope to do is to attract
                  attention to one of the most virulent intellectual plagues of
                  our time: the lack of critical thinking that permeates modern
                  U. S. society. What I would like to see is evolution: the evolution
                  of one or two of these presentations into a serious two hour
                  program on the reasons behind the First Amendment protections
                  of shows like <i>Crossing Over With John Edward</i>, for example.
                  While Penn and Teller effectively point out that fraudulent mediums
                  flourish on the nation's airwaves and that the legal system seems
                  incapable of dealing with them, they don't have the time to explain
                  the difficulties in regulating this kind of speech in a nation
                  with a First Amendment, nor can they fully explore the extent
                  to which victims of frauds and misinformation they discuss are
                  responsible for their own victimization. Penn and Teller could
                  deepen and sharpen the debate by extending it by inviting along
                  some thoughtful commentators and by giving them more airtime
                  than such folks currently get on talk shows and pseudo-investigative
                  programs. The issues Penn and Teller raise are important; with
                  magical assistance even lawyers and scientists could make them
                  fascinating as well.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I'll go on watching the show;
                  Penn and Teller's fresh approach to pseudoscience, fraud and
                  the general ridiculousness of the human condition entertains
                  me mightily, although the four letter words wear me out. Besides,
                  I'm partial to Teller.<hr align="LEFT">Bibliography:</font></p>
