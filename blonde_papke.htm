                  <p><b><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Legally Blonde</font></i></b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">, by David Papke</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">David Papke is a law professor
                  at the Indiana University School of Law in Indianapolis, and
                  Virginia Papke, his daughter, is an eighth-grader at St. Richard's
                  School in Indianapolis. They enjoy going to the movies together,
                  but they do not always reach the same conclusions about what
                  they've seen . . . .</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/legally blonde 10.jpg" width="149" height="199" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">David:
                  Did you enjoy <i>Legally Blonde</i>?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Virginia: It was cool.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">David: What did you like about
                  it?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Virginia: Elle Wood. I liked
                  the way she looked, the way she dressed, the way she was so happy
                  and up-beat. I even liked her dog Bruiser. That mutt was hilarious!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">David: The movie is one of
                  those law-related movies I like to write and think about. It
                  has some interesting things to say regarding the law.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Virginia: Pulease. This is
                  a chick flick if ever there was one. It's about a young woman
                  who shows up the jerk who dumped her and then gets a new and
                  better boyfriend. Almost everybody in the theater was a girl.
                  I went because I'm blonde and wanted to see a movie about a girl
                  who is blonde.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">David: But Elle Wood goes to
                  law school and learns to think like a lawyer. There were some
                  great scenes of classrooms, study groups, and faculty conferences
                  at Harvard Law School. Modern legal education started at Harvard
                  in the 1870s, and many of us in legal academics still think of
                  Harvard as the symbolic home of legal education.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Virginia: That's not really
                  Harvard Law School. It's not serious. It's not a real-life picture.
                  You yourself showed me the letters from the Harvard students
                  in USA TODAY saying how silly the portrait of Harvard was.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">David: Okay, but there's also
                  a trial. Elle Wood succeeds as a defense counsel in the courtroom,
                  in the inner sanctum of the law. Almost all law movies have dramatic,
                  powerful courtroom scenes. Americans find messages of morality
                  and justice in dramatic courtroom proceedings.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Virginia: Dad, it's a Hollywood
                  movie. It's all made-up. The courtroom's only a coincidence.
                  It might just as well have been a proceeding in a video arcade.
                  The courtroom is just a setting to show off Elle Wood's clothes
                  and make-up and let us know how cute and lovable she is. How
                  does she win her case? She tells everybody what you can do after
                  getting a perm. Was that about law and justice?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">David: I guess different people
                  can see the same movie in different ways. There's even a theory
                  about this called reader response or reader reaction theory.
                  According to the theory, a movie is not just a container into
                  which writers and directors pour meanings which will later be
                  drained by the people who see the movie. Instead, individual
                  viewers bring their own values, tastes and histories to a movie,
                  and they respond or react to the movie in different ways. Variable
                  meanings then result from the multiplicity of movie-viewer interactions.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Virginia: What if I said <i>Legally
                  Blonde</i> was a cowboy movie?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">David: It's not like anything
                  goes. There are boundaries for the possible meanings. You can't
                  argue that law students are cowboys. There has to be something
                  in a movie that would justify a viewer interpreting it in a given
                  way.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Virginia: And I can't see counting
                  <i>Legally Blonde</i> as a law movie. It's a chick flick, and
                  I'm glad that it is.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">David: Are you too old for
                  a time out? <br>
                  </font></p>
