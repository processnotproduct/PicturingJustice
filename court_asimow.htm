                  OFF THE JUSTICES: THE SUPREME COURT IN POP CULTURE</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Most people know almost nothing
                  about the Supreme Court--who the justices are, what sorts of
                  cases it decides, how it goes about deciding them. Occasionally,
                  as in the case of the Bork or Thomas nominations, or epochal
                  struggles such as Bush v. Gore, the Court pops up on television
                  news or the front page of the newspaper. Then it retreats back
                  into the shadows. It labors in obscurity, its bland and wordy
                  opinions read only by a few law geeks. Television and radio,
                  of course, are excluded from oral arguments, and that means that
                  for most people, the Court barely exists at all. Whatever people
                  might have learned about the Court in high school civics, they've
                  long since forgotten. Besides, it was all wrong anyway.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/court3.jpg" width="154" height="188" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The
                  obscurity that surrounds the Court is tragic, since it is of
                  such surpassing importance to every human being in America. On
                  so many issues, the Court is where the rubber hits the road.
                  Whether the issue is abortion, campaign finance reform, public
                  funding of religious schools, military tribunals, the death penalty,
                  attorney advertising and literally thousands of other vital public
                  policy controversies--the Court gets the last word. Do people
                  really understand that a woman's right to choose is hanging by
                  a hair in the Supreme Court right now? Who are these black-robed
                  demigods and goddesses with life tenure? Do they sit on a judicial
                  Mt. Olympus, far above petty politics, dispensing justice guided
                  only by a splendid impartiality and respect for precedent? When
                  they went on the Court, was it like joining a monastic order,
                  putting their personal lives and all human temptations behind
                  them?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Well, actually, no. It's nothing
                  like that. The justices are bare-knuckled, power-hungry, deal-making,
                  intensely ideological politicians, not at all different from
                  those you'll find over at the White House or in the halls of
                  Congress, except that they wear black robes and skillfully avoid
                  public accountability. If ever this was in doubt, Bush v. Gore
                  dispelled that doubt. We need to demystify the Supreme Court
                  and get people to understand that these are just politicians
                  of the third kind. The justices, and their decisions, deserve
                  no more deference or respect than do those of the President or
                  Congress. Deference and respect must be earned by the quality
                  of the product, and the values that infuse that product, not
                  by virtue of the institution that produces them.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">That's why television shows
                  about the Supreme Court are so very important. Popular culture
                  provides the only way that the general public gets to peek at
                  the inner workings of an institution as mysterious to them as
                  though it operated on another planet. Television lets us watch
                  the justices going about their work, striking deals, horse-trading,
                  doing politics. We see the tremendous power and importance of
                  law clerks, who, after all, are barely out of law school. And
                  we come to understand that the cases the Court decides, day in
                  and day out, often by votes of 5-4, transform our public life
                  in so many fundamental ways.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Thus I applaud <i><a href="firstmonday_asimow.htm">First
                  Monday</a></i> and <i>The Court</i>. Both shows effectively demythologize
                  the Supreme Court by showing the justices as ordinary human beings.
                  They also treat them as political players, exercising immense
                  but unaccountable power, unconstrained by anything except their
                  own philosophy and values. Long may these shows reign! As some
                  critic said of <i>First Monday</i>, &quot;May God save this honorable
                  court from cancellation.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Especially <i>The Court</i>.
                  I really liked its debut. Well, not quite everything about the
                  debut. The confirmation hearing was pretty lame, with Kate Nolan's

                  refusal to say whether she'd ever had an abortion being the only
                  highlight. I would have gotten a couple of episodes out of the
                  confirmation fight, replaying the Bork and Thomas dramas, so
                  that people can be reminded how brutal such fights can be (and
                  certainly promise to be in the future when Bush nominates an
                  Ashcroft clone to replace Justice Stevens). I expected the dynamic
                  journalistic duo to unearth their skeleton in time to affect
                  the confirmation hearing -- otherwise, who cares? The story line
                  involving the clerks of the deceased justice being passed around
                  to the other justices, and sharing memos, was not dramatically
                  effective (although their party was fairly funny). It's obvious
                  that we'll need several episodes to get to know the large cast
                  of justices, clerks and journalists (but that was true of <i>West
                  Wing</i> also). I'm willing to make the investment.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I thought the writing of the
                  show was crisp and witty--far superior to the lame dialogue we've
                  cringed at during episodes of <i>First Monday</i>. Some of it
                  compared favorably to <i>The West Wing</i>. I thought Sally Field
                  was entirely believable in the role, and I loved the slightly
                  corny ending when she sits alone at the Justices' table and contemplates
                  the incredible power that she now holds in her hands. I could
                  imagine myself doing that. I liked that the other justices are
                  not buffoons, as some of them are on <i>First Monday</i>. It's
                  a mistake to treat Supreme Court justices as comic figures; they
                  need to be treated, as <i>West Wing</i> treats its characters
                  (including both protagonists and antagonists), as serious, motivated,
                  and powerful political players.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">And best of all, I liked the
                  scenes at the end when Justice Nolan jumped into her first conference,
                  on the tremendously important issue of the constitutionality
                  of three-strikes legislation. She had not heard the oral argument
                  and would be expected to recuse herself. On the contrary, she
                  forced an evenly-divided Court to rehear the case so that she
                  will get to vote on it at the next term. This infuriated her
                  brethren and sistren, and it was a truly gutty (and rather savvy)
                  move for a brand new justice. More power to her!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The clever way the three-strikes
                  case played out reminded me of the way that Brown v. Board of
                  Education evolved in the early 1950's, as recounted in Richard
                  Kluger's Simple Justice. When Brown was argued for the first
                  time, the Court was sharply split. Possibly there was a narrow
                  majority for ending segregation and overruling Plessy, but the
                  decision would been deeply divisive and probably quite ineffective
                  in rooting out an institution as deeply rooted as segregation.
                  Justice Frankfurter persuaded the Court to rehear the case, with
                  the litigants asked to brief issues relating to the legislative
                  history of the Fourteenth Amendment. Providentially, Chief Justice
                  Fred Vinson (who clearly opposed overruling Plessy) died just
                  before the new term opened. Frankfurter remarked to a former
                  clerk,&quot;This is the first indication I have ever had that
                  there is a God.&quot; Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as the
                  new chief justice. Warren turned out to be pretty much the exact
                  opposite of what Eisenhower expected, on racial issues no less
                  than many others. The rest is, as they say, is history.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So let's hope that The Court
                  can continue to generate high drama and empathetic characters,
                  that it will dwell on big issues and make them concrete to millions
                  of people, that it will become <i>The West Wing</i> of the most
                  dangerous and least accountable branch. <br>
