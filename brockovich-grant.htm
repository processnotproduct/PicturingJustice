    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest offering from director Steven Soderbergh
    might have been pitched as &quot;<i>Norma Rae</i> meets <i>Pretty Woman</i>.&quot;
    Featuring the original pretty woman, Julia Roberts, <i>Erin Brockovich</i> is, on one
    level, an uplifting story about a loveable working class hero. It is made all the more
    satisfying because it is based on the true tale of a real life Erin Brockovich. The sexy,
    single mother fights the good fight and wins. You have to love it. While the film succeeds
    as a feel-good film for liberals and admittedly features a winning cast, the
    representations of class, the law, lawyers and gender are disturbing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; As the film opens, a scantily clad, trash talking
    Erin Brockovich sinks her own</font></font><small><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"><img src="images/erin-1.JPG" alt="erin-1.JPG (23295 bytes)" width="180" height="287" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10"></font></small><font size="2"><font face="Verdana"> hopes for winning a personal injury claim against the yuppie who injured
    her neck in a car accident by being too honest on the witness stand. Expressing her
    frustration with opposing counsel in a string of colorful four-letter words, Brockovich
    biases the jury against her, and loses her case. </font><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Cut to a montage of shots of Erin unsuccessfully
    looking for work, meeting and then wittily blowing off the handsome biker next door, and
    being ignored by her attorney, the crusty Ed Masrey, engagingly played by Albert Finney.
    In desperation, and suffering under the twisted reasoning that her attorney owes her the
    money he promised he would win for her, Erin heads to Masrey&#146;s office and insinuates
    herself into a job at his firm. &quot;Please don&#146;t make me beg,&quot; she says in
    what we will soon see is a typically Erin-esque public outburst. Castigating Masrey for
    losing her case, she betrays a certain charm (not to mention cleavage). Breasts thrust
    bravely forward, Erin stands up (and out) for herself, her kids and her principles.
    Proving to be both a quick study and a diligent worker, Erin prevails as an adept
    paralegal despite the judgmental and snide gazes of her female co-workers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of working on a <i>pro-bono</i> real
    estate case, Erin stumbles upon a series of questions that, when deftly investigated by
    her, ultimately result in over six hundred plaintiffs winning a $333 million lawsuit
    against the $30 billion corporate giant, <i>Pacific Gas and Electric</i>. It is still the
    largest settlement ever paid in a class action lawsuit in the United States. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; As the story unfolds, <i>PG &amp; E</i> emerges as
    such an evil monster that it would stretch credibility if we did not know in advance that
    the story was true. The startling facts are that after having polluted a nearby
    community&#146;s water supply with a particularly nasty form of the chemical
    &quot;chromium,&quot; <i>PG &amp; E</i> not only denied that it was dangerous, but
    actually sent pamphlets to the residents knowingly and falsely portraying the chemical as
    benign, even touting it as &quot;good&quot; for the water. The resulting health disasters
    (cancer clusters, miscarriages, deteriorating organs, etc.) were initially dismissed by
    the victims as the results of their own individual bad luck and poor lifestyle choices.
    When Brockovich brings the startling facts to their attention, they are at first unwilling
    to believe that &quot;their&quot; company would do something so vile. Next, they are
    skeptical that if they fight, they might triumph against such a giant capitalist. Using a
    combination of her native intelligence, feminine wiles and working class simpatico,
    Brockovich is able to secure the documents that prove beyond doubt that the local<i> PG
    &amp; E</i> knowingly polluted, and then set about to cover-up its crimes. At least
    according to the film, what really sank <i>PG &amp; E</i> legally was the smoking gun
    document that proved they had done all of this with the blessing of the national
    headquarters. Furthermore, they attempted to cover their tracks in the time-honored
    tradition of the corporate killers of Karen Silkwood and the document shredding Oliver
    North. Foreknowledge on the part of the deep-pocketed corporate headquarters made it
    financially feasible to pursue the case. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; What could be bad about such an inspiring story? To
    start, its images of the law, lawyers, gender and class. <i>Erin Brockovich</i> follows a
    particular legal thriller formula in which that lawyer with the most unsuccessful practice
    and the least elite law degree turns out to be the most honest person and the best all
    around attorney (e.g., <i>A Civil Action, The Verdict</i>). In <i>Erin Brockovich</i>, the
    large law firm that ultimately bankrolls the case and takes it to its conclusion, is
    portrayed as a collection of patronizing stuffed shirts out for profit, not justice. This
    may, in fact, be an accurate description of many big personal injury firms. However, this
    justice/profit dichotomy may also reflect a contradiction inherent in the desire to see
    lawyers as fighters for the underclass in the first place. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact is that the price of law school, and the

    realities of firms in capitalist economies mean that lawyers who want to pay their law
    school debts and make a living (or who even want to afford to work on contingency for
    cases such as this one), pretty much do have to work for profit. The sad fact is that when
    it is not profitable, justice often is not compatible with capitalism. And, in this
    economic reality, so much the worse for justice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; The other problem is that Erin Brockovich&#146;s
    story is most instructive about class and gender. But in the hands Hollywood, class
    politics are masked as individualistic heroics. In the words of the well-meaning wife of
    one of the film&#146;s producers (who first brought the story to her husband&#146;s
    attention), &quot;I couldn't believe it when my doctor told me about her friend Erin. It
    seemed incredible that this twice-divorced woman with three young children, who had no
    money,no resources and no formal education had single-handedly put this case together. I
    thought she seemed like the perfect role model for the new millennium&quot; (See
    <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/moviepreview/0,3971,150,erinbrockovich.html">link</a>).
    </font></font><small><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"><img src="images/erin-2.JPG" alt="erin-2.JPG (27739 bytes)" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="187" height="329"></font></small><font size="2"><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, Ok. But the fact of the matter is that Erin
    didn&#146;t &quot;single handedly&quot; put the case together. In fact, she wouldn&#146;t
    have had much of a case at all had an ex-<i>PG&amp;E</i> worker not neglected to perform
    his paper shredding duties, and then, for some reason, kept the most useful and damning
    documents. Erin wouldn&#146;t have had a case had the lust stricken boy in the documents
    room not allowed her to copy other damaging documents even when he was ordered not to. <br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; As wonderful as her commitment to this case was, and
    as great a triumph as was the victory, the fact is that the reality of this case is not
    nearly so uplifting as it seems at first glance. Indeed, what is remarkable is how
    anomalous this case is. What is amazing is the sheer amount of evidence it took to prove
    in a court of law that people were poisoned to increase PG&amp;E&#146;s profit margin.
    What is astounding is that the white-collar killers were (and are) able to hide behind the
    corporate veil, tax deduct their legal costs, and go on about their business. The sum of
    $333 million which sounds so huge in the film, was actually split between the attorneys
    (who got at least 40% of the sum), and then split again between over six hundred clients.
    Seen that way, it doesn&#146;t really sound like so much money anymore, especially given
    that this is the largest settlement in history. It should also be noted that because of
    the structure of certain aspects of the legal system that are basically a shrine to the
    corporation, no one went to jail for crimes that resulted in many deaths and disabilities.
    Someone almost surely would have had this been a case of assault with a deadly weapon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; The gender politics of this film are also vexed.
    Besides Erin, the only other working women in the film are either the jealous ones with
    whom Brockovich works at Masry&#146;s firm (&quot;Lover&#146;s quarrel?&quot; one snipes
    when Brockovich storms out of Masry&#146;s office after a particularly tense argument), or
    the asexual, masculinized female attorneys who work in the upscale personal injury firm.
    Brockovich is romanticized as an authentic member of the working class who can go in there
    and speak their lingo. However, she is &quot;still a woman,&quot; not ashamed to use sex
    to get the job done. This presents another anomaly. Despite the film&#146;s point of view,
    it is less odd to find sexiness and brains in the same package then it is to find men
    taking that combination seriously as they apparently do with Erin. In reality, the
    seemingly asexual attorney in the upscale firm got that way for a reason, and it is not
    her own frigidity! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, as she herself admits in the film, her
    devotion to the case against <i>PG&amp;E</i> is partly a self-esteem issue for Erin. It is
    the first time, she says, that anyone ever treated her with any respect. Through quirks of
    timing and luck, the real Erin ended up making a bundle of money and having Julia Roberts
    play her in the movie. However, most women in her situation get little more than a string
    of bad boyfriends, minimum wage jobs and objectifying sex. The devotion of the Erin
    Brockovichs of the world is not the answer to corporate crime, nor is she a role model for
    the working class women who want to fight the big guys. She is a glorious exception that
    proves that the rules must be changed.</font></font></p>
