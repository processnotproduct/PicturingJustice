                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Ken Swift</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Caddyshack</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> was not a great cinematic achievement
                  or a movie of social importance.  Harold Ramis's directorial
                  debut, approaching its 25th anniversary, is a collection of thin
                  plot lines.  <i>Caddyshack</i> has, however, seeped into popular
                  culture, perhaps as much as any other film, due to a barrage
                  of one-liners performed by comedic talents such as Bill Murray,
                  Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, and Ted Knight.  It very well
                  may be the most quoted movie of all time (at least for my demographic,
                  white males under 45), as even today one can not walk past a
                  golf course without hearing someone being told to &quot;be the
                  ball&quot; or noting that their ball is &quot;in da hole.&quot;
                   Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura even asked the Dalai
                  Lama if he had seen the movie, which includes a scene where assistant
                  greens keeper and potential gopher assassin Carl Spackler brags
                  that he caddied for the Dalai Lama (big hitter) on a course in
                  the Himalayas.  The Dalai Lama told the governor that he had
                  not seen the film, but, reportedly, leaned over to the governor
                  at the end of their meeting and said &quot;Gunga ga lunga. Gunga
                  la gungala gunga&quot;, which is what Spackler claims the Dalai
                  Lama said after hitting a big tee shot.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/caddyshack.jpg" width="152" height="209" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><i>Caddyshack</i> also embraces
                  many of the commonly held negative notions about lawyers and
                  how they manipulate the power of the law for their own personal
                  advantage.  The &quot;bad guy&quot; in the film is Judge Smails
                  (Ted Knight), who owns Bushwood Country Club, where the movie
                  takes place.   It is through Smails that the negative stereotype
                  of lawyers is developed.<br>
<br>
                  The movie addresses also the love/hate relationship between the
                  medical and legal professions.  Judge Smails' golfing buddy in
                  the movie is a doctor, the aptly named Dr. Beeper.  The two lord
                  over Bushwood. In the end, however, the doctor is forced by the
                  lawyer to potentially put a patient in jeopardy by delaying surgery
                  to play in a high-stakes golf match that the doctor does not
                  want to participate in.<br>
<br>
                  Lawyers are also shown to have &quot;pliable&quot; ethics.  In
                  an opening scene, an obnoxious land developer, Al Czervik (Rodney
                  Dangerfield), becomes impatient with Judge Smails' pre-tee off
                  contortions (&quot;while were young&quot;) and bets the judge
                  that he will slice his shot into the woods.  The judge fires
                  back that: &quot;gambling is illegal at Bushwood.  And I never
                  slice.&quot;  At the end of the movie, however, the judge takes
                  part in a high-stakes golf match because he is certain that his
                  team has an advantage.<br>
<br>
                  The abuse of power is exemplified in the relationship of Judge
                  Smails and Danny Noonan.  Noonan is a caddie and a high school
                  senior who sees the caddie scholarship, controlled by Judge Smails,
                  as his only chance for college.  The judge uses this power to
                  get Noonan to mow his lawn and help him to cheat at golf (by
                  looking the other way while the judge uses the always valuable
                  &quot;foot wedge&quot; to improve his lie).  Noonan even covers
                  for the judge's temper.  After Smails misses an important putt,
                  he angrily throws his putter several hundred feet into an outdoor
                  cafe, striking a woman.  Noonan steps up and takes the blame,
                  noting that he should have warned the judge that &quot;his grips
                  were worn.&quot;  Finally, after Noonan's tryst with the judge's
                  niece turns into a semi-public event that could potentially embarrass
                  the judge, the judge uses his power, in this case the caddie
                  scholarship, to bribe Noonan into silence.<br>
<br>
                  In the end, however, Noonan realizes that he does not like himself
                  very much and turns on Smails and beats him in the big golf match,
                  providing us with a the requisite good over evil finish.  As
                  assistant greenskeeper Spackler would say &quot;that's all she
                  wrote.&quot;<br>
