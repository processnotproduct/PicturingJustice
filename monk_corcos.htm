<br>
                  <i>Monk</i>, the detective series featuring the obsessive-compulsive
                  disorder-ridden former police officer played by Emmy winner Tony
                  Shalhoub, has been a hit for the USA network since its debut
                  on July 12, 2002. Heavily influenced by classic series that went
                  before, including <i>Columbo</i>, which still makes occasional
                  appearances on TV (although the latest seems to have been in
                  2003), <i>Monk</i> adds to the formula of the brilliant detective
                  with a few quirks the brilliant detective with quirks that threaten
                  to make him almost completely non-functional.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/monk.jpg" width="91" height="133" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><i>Monk</i>'s premise is that
                  the former police officer turned private detective left the force
                  when his wife died in a car bombing meant for him. Adrian Monk
                  (who carries, perhaps significantly, two clerical names) was
                  already rather strange. For example, we learn in the episode
                  &quot;<i>Mr. Monk and the Other Woman</i>&quot; that he doesn't
                  like different types of food to touch on his plate. Most of us
                  got over that little oddity when we were relatively young. I
                  think my nephews, who are nine and seven, are over it by now.
                  But not Adrian Monk. His wife Trudy, however, loved him in spite
                  of this foible, and in spite of his other weirdnesses, such as
                  his need to make certain that all the hangers in his closet face
                  the same way-I suppose that could be helpful in an emergency-and
                  the need not to step on cracks, and to touch all the parking
                  meters that he passes on the street. After Trudy's death, he
                  just gets stranger and stranger, and he refuses to take any medication
                  to calm him down. In one episode, &quot;<i>Mr. Monk Takes His
                  Medicine</i>&quot;, we find out that this is not such a bad idea-medication
                  robs him of his ability to solve crimes even as it evens out
                  his OCD. Monk's peculiar personality makes him a trial to deal
                  with, certainly, but he has a good heart, and his friends recognize
                  his kindness, which earns him their loyalty. His nurse, Sharona,
                  and later his assistant, Natalie, his police officer friends
                  Lieutenant Disher and Captain Stottlemeyer, and the various people
                  he meets during his adventures, Trudy's parents, and even his
                  even weirder brother Ambrose, who suffers from agoraphobia, all
                  truly love him, and he loves them. Actor Tony Shalhoub's talent
                  sells Monk as a character-otherwise the detective would grate
                  on the viewer very quickly, because frankly, he is one odd bird.
                  He's afraid of over a hundred things, as Natalie points out,
                  though not public speaking: heights, dark places, crowds, germs-and
                  milk.<br>
<br>
                  What motivates Monk is the desire to find his wife's killer.
                  While he seeks the person or persons responsible, he takes other
                  cases, high profile or not, particularly those that interest
                  him. Things that don't match, people who do things out of character,
                  push him to investigate. At the same time, he is often reluctant
                  to involve himself in a case that would force him to confront
                  a phobia. He doesn't like shaking hands, or elevators, or airplanes.
                  In many ways, Monk is frightened of life. Decisions paralyze
                  him. What unparalyzes him is the need for justice.<br>
<br>
                  Many critics have hailed <i>Monk</i> as ingeniously plotted.
                  True, the writers have done many of the episodes quite cleverly,
                  but other entries been derivative. In particular, the two episodes
                  featuring Monk's brother Ambrose (John Turturro) were essentially
                  the same story. In both, the killer tries to reclaim evidence
                  of a crime that has gotten away from him; Monk has to retrace
                  the killer's steps and put together the crime from these clues.
                  The episode &quot;<i>Red Headed Stranger</i>&quot;, featuring
                  country singer Willie Nelson, draws on several Columbo episodes
                  including &quot;<i>Swan Song</i>&quot; (1974) in which guest
                  star country singer Johnny Cash (&quot;<i>The Man in Black</i>&quot;)
                  played a country singer who murders his wife, and &quot;<i>A
                  Deadly State of Mind</i>&quot; (1975) in which George Hamilton
                  sets Lesley Ann Warren up for murder. Nelson returns as a voice
                  on the tube in a later episode (&quot;<i>Mr. Monk and the Blackout</i>&quot;).<br>
<br>
                  Monk's obsessive-compulsive disorder and his inability to react
                  appropriately while on duty (for example, he can't bring himself
                  to fire his weapon even when someone's life is at stake) are
                  the reason for what is turning into his quasi-permanent suspension
                  from the San Francisco Police Force (note to the writers: he
                  would have been an inspector, not a &quot;detective&quot; while
                  on the force). He is on medical leave, which gives him certain
                  rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. So why does
                  the Police Commissioner treat him so cavalierly in &quot;<i>Mr.
                  Monk Gets Fired</i>&quot; by &quot;yanking&quot; his private
                  detective's license? Let's leave aside exactly what his employment
                  relationship is with the department, and whether a police officer
                  can also hold a p.i.'s license. The San Francisco Police Commissioner
                  is not authorized to do that under California state law. Only
                  the Director of Professional and Vocational Standards may revoke
                  or suspend a p.i.'s license, and s/he surely wouldn't do it for
                  the reasons in this episode (Monk accidentally deleted some police
                  files from a computer, but the computer wasn't adequately backed
                  up. Sounds like improper police procedure, not Monk-i-shines,
                  to me.) <br>
<br>
                  This program's major assets are not necessarily the plotting,
                  although it is usually clever, and considerable. They are the
                  acting talents of everyone concerned, not just Tony Shalhoub.
                  Ted Levine as the bemused Captain Stottlemeyer, Jason Gray-Stanford
                  as Lieutenant Randy Disher, the man who overestimates his own
                  abilities to solve crimes and who longs for a date with any pretty
                  girl who wanders into his field of vision, Sharona (Bitty Schramm),
                  the matter of fact nurse who spent two years dealing with Monk
                  before returning to her ex-husband, another man who has trouble
                  dealing with life, Natalie (Traylor Howard), recently hired on
                  as Monk's new assistant, Dr. Kroger (Stanley Kamel) as Monk's
                  long suffering psychiatrist, who just wants to get his patient
                  to a goal-any goal and himself to a summer vacation--these are
                  all worthy colleagues on the series. The guest stars are always
                  entertaining, from Adam Arkin as &quot;Dale the Whale&quot;,
                  a marvelous bad guy who may hold the key to the identity of Trudy's
                  killer, to Lolita Davidovich as a beautiful trapeze artist, to
                  Glenne Headly (in an occasional role as Stottlemeyer's wife Karen).<br>
<br>
                  Monk does not believe in coincidence. He does not believe in
                  psychic powers. He does not believe in accident. He believes
                  in logic. He believes in reason. He may have OCD and he may have
                  personal problems, but when he has a crime to solve it occupies
                  all of his attention. In the episode &quot;<i>Mr. Monk and the
                  Psychic</i>,&quot; for example (aired July 19, 2002), Monk becomes
                  suspicious when a psychic claims that a dead woman's &quot;aura&quot;
                  leads her to the woman's body. He unravels the crime by deducing
                  that the victim's husband, a former police commissioner, murdered
                  her and used the psychic to deflect attention from himself. Monk
                  expresses his attitude to Sharona in a wonderful line. &quot;You've
                  got to be a little skeptical, Sharona. Otherwise you end up believing
                  in everything--UFOs, elves, income tax rebates.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  Some of the episodes are downright weak in terms of plot. The
                  March 16th episode, &quot;<i>Mr. Monk Gets Jury Duty</i>,&quot;
                  for example, featured Monk as a jury member unable to focus when
                  he realizes that someone has secreted a body in a dumpster just
                  below the window of the jury deliberation room. Since he has
                  already made a nuisance of himself, the bailiff won't pay any
                  attention to him. So he calls out to his assistant Natalie, who
                  is in the street below as she is bringing him lunch. (Why is
                  she bringing him lunch? Lunch should be provided by the court,
                  but of course, Monk's dietary requirements have already been
                  explained to the judge).<br>
<br>
                  Of course, jury members are not supposed to contact anyone but
                  the bailiff during their deliberations, as both Monk and Natalie
                  know very well. But the contact goes on. Natalie summons Captain
                  Stottlemeyer, and Stottlemeyer communicates with Monk while Monk
                  is in the jury room. Eventually the judge spots Monk and the
                  police discussing the body and he sequesters the jury, who are
                  consequently enraged with Monk. The judge should probably have
                  declared a mistrial, but that would be the end of the episode,
                  and Monk would not get the chance to solve the other mystery
                  in the story, which is why one of the jurors keeps changing her
                  vote just as everyone else agrees on a verdict. Monk is, incidentally,
                  instrumental in convincing them that the case on which they are
                  deliberating is a frame-up: it's highly reminiscent of <i>Twelve
                  Angry Men</i>, down to the functional identifications of the
                  other jury members (&quot;Postal Worker Juror&quot;, &quot;Sports
                  Fan Juror&quot;, etc.). <br>
<br>
                  The <i>Monk</i> writers and directors often indulge in these
                  kinds of popular culture references as if to invite the audience
                  into their tight little world. Guest stars like Tim Daly (with
                  whom Shalhoub co-starred on <i>Wings)</i> and Danny Bonaduce
                  play themselves. But one of the things that rapidly becomes annoying
                  is the lack of credibility that Monk enjoys week after week.
                  Monk is always right-so why don't people who have heard of him
                  believe him when he says he thinks he knows who the killer might
                  be? And why don't they run interference for him? In this country,
                  which caters so much to celebrities, it's very difficult to understand
                  why Monk has so much trouble getting himself heard. We know the
                  answer-the plot would evaporate because Monk would have many
                  fewer difficulties. His weird little phobias must also earn him,
                  if not enemies, then adversaries. Otherwise, things would be
                  much too easy. Those adversaries, if they are the criminals,
                  do eventually grant him their respect, as in &quot;<i>Mr. Monk
                  and the Astronaut</i>.&quot; But it takes the entire episode,
                  and coupled with Monk's phobias, it can become wearying for the
                  viewer. This particular element-the criminal's lack of respect
                  for the detective, which sometimes degenerates into taunting-again
                  recalls Columbo. <br>
<br>
                  Through the four seasons that the show has been on the air, all
                  the recurring characters have grown. Stottlemeyer has learned
                  not to take his marriage or his wife for granted, just as she
                  has left him. Disher has learned a little something about the
                  intelligence and the emotional reliability of the opposite sex.
                  Monk himself has learned that his dead wife would have wanted
                  him to try to move on with his life. Coming to that determination
                  hasn't been easy, even deliberately with the assistance of his
                  psychiatrist, or accidentally through the mishaps attendant on
                  assisting his friends.<br>
<br>
                  In &quot;<i>Mr. Monk Goes to the Dentist</i>&quot; Lieutenant
                  Disher thinks he sees his dentist kill someone, but no one believes
                  him. Out of a mixture of pique and a sense that years on the
                  force have earned him no loyalty from either his superiors or
                  his friends he quits to pursue a career in rock music (a very
                  bad decision). Natalie convinces Monk to investigate. Now Monk
                  is in the position of being the person who doesn't believe, but
                  who gives a friend the benefit of the doubt, and who discovers
                  that the friend is correct. Through that experience, he grows
                  just a little more, as does Disher, who realizes that rock music
                  is a fine hobby for someone who is a good enough musician to
                  know that he's not good enough to be a professional musician.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Monk</i> is a very moral show. Adrian Monk is a very moral
                  man. He believes in justice and he goes after crime and criminals
                  no matter where they may be. Working in the private sphere, assisting
                  the professionals in the public sphere, he still yearns to return
                  to the police force, even though he can still interact with his
                  old friends unofficially, and some of them still respect his
                  work. He knows that the likelihood that he will ever to that
                  life is small. Meanwhile, he continues to take private cases,
                  and those on which Captain Stottlemeyer invites him to assist.
                  He overcomes his own fears to do it. His friends, Natalie, like
