                  MONDAY</i></font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The United States Supreme Court
                  resolves a huge number of fundamental social and political issues,
                  problems that are resolved in political venues in every other
                  country. Bush v. Gore was only the most conspicuous and recent
                  example of the centrality of the Court in our political life.
                  Yet, the Court functions behind a veil of obscurity, its oral
                  arguments off limits to television and the conferences of the
                  justices shrouded in total secrecy. The bland legalese of the
                  Court's written opinions masks the often nakedly political calculations
                  of the justices and the horse-trading for votes that produced
                  a grant of cert and a majority opinion. Except to the cognoscenti,
                  the role of the justices' law clerks is totally unknown. Thus,
                  when popular culture tries to demystify the Supreme Court and
                  explain its workings to the general public, critics should welcome
                  the effort.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">That's why I'm trying to put
                  a favorable face on the premiere of <i>First Monday</i>, despite
                  the fact that just about everybody in the media and the legal
                  community has trashed it. The fact is that, despite its immense
                  importance, the inner workings of the Supreme Court are really
                  boring to everybody except legal geeks.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The politics and personalities
                  of the executive branch make for riveting drama on <i><a href="westwing.htm">The
                  West Wing</a></i> and in numerous movies, most recently <i>The
                  Contender</i> (2000). Particular Supreme Court cases viewed from
                  the outside can make great drama--witness <i><a href="articles/larry_flynt.htm">People
                  v. Larry Flynt</a></i> (1996), <i><a href="articles/Armistad.htm">Amistad</a></i>
                  (1997), <i>Gideon's Trumpet</i> (1980), or the Emmy-winning episode
                  of <i>The Practice</i> in which the firm tried frantically to
                  secure a last-minute stay of execution for a condemned man. But
                  it's really difficult to make stories about the internal workings
                  of the Supreme Court entertaining to a mass audience. Previous
                  movies about the Court, such as <i>First Monday</i> in October
                  (1981) and <i>The Pelican Brief</i> (1993), were real duds. So
                  let's give some credit to <i>First Monday</i> for attempting
                  the perhaps impossible.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Others will, no doubt, demolish
                  the easy targets. A lot of <i>First Monday</i> was downright
                  silly (such as the judges joining hands and vowing to &quot;make
                  history&quot; like a high school football team getting psyched
                  up for the big game). Some of it was stupid and offensive (such
                  as the oral argument in the asylum case about the transsexual
                  in which the justices question the litigant who happens to be
                  sitting at the counsel table). The issues about asylum for refugees
                  are profoundly important and deserve serious treatment rather
                  than mockery. Clerks definitely do not date the lawyers, at least
                  not while the lawyer's case is pending before the Court. And
                  so forth and so on.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But I confess that I liked
                  parts of the show. Looking past the nonsense, the central part
                  of the drama was pretty good. It concerned the efforts to stay
                  the execution of a retarded prisoner in Florida who had been
                  convicted of a murder occurring when he was 16 years old. The
                  prisoner was struck by lightning while being negligently exercised
                  by prison guards during a thunderstorm. He argued that being
                  subjected to death by electrocution twice was cruel and unusual
                  punishment.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Maybe this is a frivolous contention,
                  but that's what lawyers for condemned prisoners often are reduced
                  to. In any event, it's not so frivolous. See Louisiana ex rel
                  Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947), in which four justices
                  thought that it was cruel and unusual to execute a prisoner after
                  the electric chair had malfunctioned in the first attempt to
                  execute him. Much more fundamental, of course, is the issue of
                  whether the death penalty can and should be applied to offenses
                  committed by juveniles. Finally, at the last possible moment,
                  the clerks found evidence in the record that the killing had
                  been accidental rather than deliberate, an issue that had been
                  overlooked by everybody from the trial on up. Considering the
                  abysmal level of legal representation in capital cases in the
                  South, this sort of thing is all too common.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The premiere of <i>First Monday</i>
                  dramatized some serious issues about the death penalty, about
                  last-minute legal maneuvering by counsel to stop executions,
                  and the ways that politically divided judges and justices grapple
                  with this sort of crisis. Bringing these issues before the public
                  is a valuable service, and I, for one, am willing to cut <i>First
                  Monday</i> some slack if it is prepared to dramatize issues like
                  this on a regular basis. It's light years better than the pathetic
                  rubbish about judges presented every day on Judge Judy and her
                  all-too-numerous clones.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I liked the frantic efforts
                  to secure a stay of execution and the poignancy of the show's
                  dramatic conclusion in which it was impossible to contact the
                  prison to stop the execution because its phone system had gone
                  down in the rain. I liked the politicking that surrounded the
                  denial of cert because the Chief Justice was able to turn around
                  the fourth vote for granting cert by threatening to embarrass
                  one of the justices by what he had once written in a law review
                  article. I liked the way Justice Novelli was forced to grapple
                  with a highly contentious stay of execution during his first
                  day on the job and the way he and his clerks rose to the occasion.
                  I liked the way <i>First Monday</i> depicted the efforts of the
                  law clerks to force the death penalty issues onto the agenda
                  of the justices (and the way other clerks worked to keep the
                  issue off the agenda). I liked the way the various justices maneuvered
                  to draw Novelli into their camps. And I especially liked that
                  the justices were portrayed as ordinary human beings, warts and
                  all. OK, some of them seemed like buffoons--but at least they
                  weren't presented as godlike creatures in black robes who lack
                  personalities and personal lives.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Most of what the Supreme Court
                  does is pretty boring, but stays of execution or major political
                  cases like Bush v. Gore or Roe v. Wade are anything but boring.
                  The Court deals with such monster clashes of values as abortion,
                  the right to die, hate speech, endangered species, and on and
                  on. Its pivotal role in our democracy and the highly political
                  way it decides cases are widely misunderstood. So let's give
                  one cheer to a team of producers, writers and directors who are
                  prepared to dig out some marketable drama in the Supreme Court
                  and bring it into our living rooms. <br>
