                  FEMALE LAWYER EMERGES FROM THE WRECKAGE</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">You can just imagine the meeting
                  where they pitched the script of <i>High Crimes</i>--it can't
                  miss.  It's <i>A Few Good Men</i> meets <i>Jagged Edge</i>! 
                   All right!  Green light!   Unfortunately, <i>High Crimes</i>
                  turns out to be a mediocre, contrived hash.  Even for fans of
                  the courtroom movie genre,  it's nothing more than an OK video
                  rental when you can't find anything better.   It doesn't come
                  close to the quality of the two films from which it's so obviously
                  derived.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As in <i>A Few Good Men</i>,
                  we're dealing with the prosecution by the Marine Corps of  an
                  ex-Marine named Ron Chapman.  It's another of these hush-hush
                  national security type cases.  Chapman is accused of murdering
                  nine Salvadorian civilians during a raid on the town of Las Colinas
                  during the Salvadorian civil war (the politics of which go completely
                  unexplored).   He, of course, claims to be completely innocent
                  and the victim of a Marine cover-up orchestrated by the high-powered
                  Gen. Bill Marks and the ominous Major Hernandez.   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Chapman (Jim Kavaziel) has
                  been living for the last 12 years as Tom Kubik, a warm, lovable
                  character married to Claire Kubik (Ashley Judd).  Claire is a
                  high-powered senior associate in a big San Francisco firm.  At
                  the beginning, we see her win a new trial for a rape defendant
                  based on prosecutorial misconduct and the senior partner hints
                  that she's about to make partner.  (What a big SF firm is doing
                  defending rape cases is unexplained).   Tom and Claire are happily
                  married and trying to get her pregnant.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The FBI arrests Tom on the
                  old Salvadorian charges and Claire rushes to the Marine base
                  at San Lazaro where she discovers he's being defended by the
                  inept Lt. Embry.  She feels she has to take a leave from her
                  firm and take over Tom/Ron's defense.  She  associates washed-up
                  lawyer Charlie Grimes (Morgan Freeman) who knows military law
                  and is a thorn in the Marines' side.  Charlie has a severe drinking
                  problem.  And so we have the three-person, mismatched defense
                  team up against the high-powered Marine prosecutors and the high
                  level cover-up.   Sound familiar?   Not to disclose any more
                  of the plot, which is highly convoluted but probably won't surprise
                  anybody. . . let's turn to the character of Claire Kubik.   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Historically, female lawyers
                  in the movies have been a complete disaster.  They have been
                  unethical, incompetent, over-emotional, messed up people with
                  horrible judgment and no personal life.  Really, aside from Katherine
                  Hepburn's historic role as Amanda Bonner in <i>Adam's Rib</i>
                  (1949), or perhaps Reggie Love in <i>The Client</i> (1994), 
                  it's hard to find a female lawyer in the movies who is both a
                  decent lawyer and a decent human being.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As the legal profession becomes
                  steadily feminized (women outnumber men at many law schools these
                  days), one would expect that there would be some decent female
                  lawyers in the movies.  Certainly, on television, there are lots
                  of women lawyers and they are empathetic and nuanced characters
                  who are skilled and competent.  But, for whatever reason, the
                  movies have lagged far behind.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Just recently, in <i>I Am Sam</i>
                  (2001), Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) typified all the elements
                  we've come to expect of our cinematic female trial lawyers. 
                  Rita's life is a chaotic mess.  She is married with a kid and
                  works ungodly hours at a big firm, thus leaving her unable to
                  manage her home life.  She is greedy, contemptuous of pro bono,
                  rude to everyone, late for everything, and lies all the time
                  to everybody in a futile attempt to manage her practice.   She
                  gets shamed into representing a retarded man (Sean Penn in a
                  really brilliant performance) who is threatened with loss of
                  custody of his precocious daughter.  Although she ultimately
                  makes a full commitment to his case, her work is replete with
                  serious errors, bad manners,  and unprofessional behavior (as
                  well chronicled by Lev Ginsburg's essay on this site). </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Well, Claire Kubik  is actually
                  nothing like the stereotypical movie woman lawyer.   She is happily
                  married (or at least, so she thinks) and professionally successful.
                    She has a decent personality and a sense of humor.   She strikes
                  you as somebody you'd like to have as a friend and somebody you'd
                  definitely want to retain as your lawyer if you were in trouble.
                   At all times, she is competent and professional.  Her work is
                  marred by no serious ethical lapses.   She does a solid job in
                  representing her husband in a difficult and sometimes rather
                  scary case.   Not an expert in military law, she retains co-counsel
                  to back her up.   So, in this respect (but in no other), <i>High
                  Crimes</i> transcends the limits of its genre.<br>
