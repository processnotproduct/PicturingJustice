    <td valign="top"><h1><font face="Verdana">Invisible Vegetarians</font></h1>
    <i><p><strong><font face="Verdana">by Max Friedman<em> </em></font></strong></i>(November 1997)<p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Vegetarians are not a typical &quot;minority,&quot; and whether
    they even belong in a discussion of media treatment of oppressed groups is open to debate.
    Unlike racial, ethnic or sexual identity, vegetarianism is a voluntarily chosen lifestyle
    that is invisible except at mealtimes: vegetarians can &quot;pass.&quot; Years of news
    media monitoring have revealed no incidents of job or housing discrimination against
    herbivores, no hate crimes targeted at patrons of vegetarian restaurants, no bank-loan
    redlining of vegetarian customers. It's not even a question of &quot;don't ask, don't
    tell&quot;: thanks to meatless Meals Ready to Eat, vegetarians can and do serve in the
    military.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Still, the portrayal of vegetarians on film and in television is
    worth examining, if only because their media image is so out of line with reality. In the
    United States, according to an independent poll conducted for <i>Vegetarian Times</i>
    magazine, some five percent of the population considers itself vegetarian; on screen,
    vegetarians are usually absent--and when they do appear, it is as exaggerated, outdated
    stereotypes. Vegetarians' invisibility is not merely a question of neglect or oversight,
    but the result of producers' decisions. The hero of the best-selling book, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Bridges+of+Madison+County%2C+The+(1995)"><i><font face="Verdana">The Bridges of Madison County</font></i></a>, is a muscular, sexy cowboy
    photographer who shocks chubby small-town farmers because he won't eat the animals they
    raise. In the movie version, Clint Eastwood cooks a meal with Meryl Streep, but any
    reference to his vegetarianism is missing from the screenplay.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Hollywood and the networks are usually obsessed with trends, but
    vegetarianism is one case where the media have been slow to catch up with a social
    phenomenon. MTV aside, television viewers are unlikely to be aware of the nexus between
    youth culture and the environmental movement that is producing a boom in the number of
    young people who heed the message of their favorite vegetarian musicians (Paul McCartney,
    k.d. lang, Michael Bolton, Eddie Vedder, Natalie Merchant, Lenny Kravitz, Peter Gabriel,
    Michael Stipe) and opt out of meat eating. <i>Newsweek</i> magazine and many newspapers
    spotted the trend, reporting a survey by Teenage Research Unlimited showing 85 percent of
    girls thought vegetarianism was &quot;in.&quot; But is that reflected in the world of TV
    teens? With rare exceptions, no.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Sara Gilbert, who plays the rebellious daughter on the popular
    sit-com <i>Roseanne</i>, insists on letting her character reflect her real-life
    commitments. Gilbert sometimes strides across the set wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with
    the words MEAT STINKS while complaining about the &quot;meat-industrial complex.&quot;
    Rarely does the script allow her to explain the reasons behind her outrage, however, and
    she falls into the first of the two most common media stereotypes of vegetarians: the
    militant making a dinner-time harangue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The other stereotype is exemplified by Andie MacDowell&#146;s
    mousy boyfriend, who loses her to Gerard Depardieu in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Green+Card+(1990)"><i>Green Card</i></a>.
    Depardieu's appeal, in contrast to the pale, skinny aesthete with whom MacDowell had been
    wasting her time, apparently comes from his insistence on preparing her a beefy dinner
    over her objections. Depardieu disparages his rival as &quot;that vegetarian&quot; and
    teaches MacDowell a lesson of <i>carpe diem</i> expressed through the holy trinity of sex,
    wine, and meat, as if the three were somehow connected. Never mind that the medical
    establishment has long accepted the link between high meat consumption and arterial
    blockage--which contributes not only to heart disease but also to impotence. The 98-pound
    weakling has been a favored image of vegetarians for decades, one that even the growing
    number of vegetarian Olympic medalists has not been able to retire.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In real life, most people decide to stop eating meat out of
    compassion for animals, concern for their own health, and disgust at the environmental
    damage and wastefulness of factory farming. They do not necessarily acquire fringe
    cultural habits or discourteous speech along with their lower cholesterol counts. But as
    pictures on a screen, vegetarians are mockeries, or else they do not exist at all. There
    is no need to see a conspiracy behind their exclusion, to imagine Live Stock and Meat
    Board agents or McDonalds vice-presidents calling up the producer of <i>Beverly Hills
    90210</i> to threaten an advertising boycott if Jennie Garth reveals her vegetarianism on
    camera. Network and Hollywood producers know that the corporate sponsors who keep their
    operations running would not be pleased to discover they are funding sympathetic
    portrayals of any group that encourages Americans not to buy profitable products or to
    make fundamental changes in society. Vegetarians are invisible on screen the way that
    millions of other &quot;normal&quot; people--leftists, feminists, civil rights activists,
    environmentalists--are made to disappear, and for much the same reasons.</font></p>
