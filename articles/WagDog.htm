    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana">Wag the Dog</font></h1>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><em><strong>by John Denvir, USF Law School</strong> </em>(February
    1998)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Barry Levinson&#146;s <i>Wag the Dog</i> is a cynical little gem.
    Its target is the American political system as it has evolved in the Reagan/Bush/Clinton
    era&#151; what we might call the post-democratic era in American politics. The focus on
    the undermining of democratic ideals reminds us of Frank Capra&#146;s classic <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Meet+John+Doe+(1941)"><i>Meet John Doe</i></a>, but
    while Capra&#146;s vehicle was melodrama, Levinson&#146;s weapon is black comedy. He is
    aided by a brilliant script by Hilary Henkin and David Mamet. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The plot revolves around the efforts of &quot;spinmaster&quot;
    Conrad Brean (Robert DeNiro) to respond to a late-breaking story that the President of the
    United States has been accused of fondling a visiting girl scout in the oval office.
    (I&#146;m not kidding! ) Brean decides to divert the public&#146;s attention from his
    client&#146;s personal problems by providing the American public with a television
    spectacle&#151;a war which only takes place on television. He then enlists the services of
    Hollywood producer Stanley Motts (Dustin Hoffman) to &quot;produce&quot; the war&#151;or
    &quot;pageant&quot; as they prefer to call it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The rest of the movie shows us how Hollywood produces a war with
    Albania. It is both hilarious and chilling. The most memorable (and instructive) scene
    shows us how computer technology can transform an American actress holding a bag of
    tortilla chips on a sound stage into an Albanian maiden escaping with her calico kitten
    from a bombed-out city as victims scream and sirens wail. But then Motts decides he needs
    a bridge to symbolize her crossing over to safety; a few keys are clicked and the bridge
    appears. The President insists on a white kitten; the computer transforms the calico kitty
    to a white one. Within hours television networks are playing and replaying this fiction as
    fast-breaking news.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In <i>Meet John Doe</i> there are heroes and villains, but in <i>Wag
    the Dog</i>, such concepts are irrelevant. Now we only have &quot;production values.&quot;
    Politics is just one more branch of &quot;show business.&quot; As Hoffman&#146;s Motts
    puts it, the change from being movie producer to president would be &quot;just a change of
    wardrobe.&quot; DeNiro and Hoffman are neither liberals nor conservatives; they&#146;re
    professionals whose jobs (as Motts again puts it) are to create things which are
    &quot;l00% fake but appear honest.&quot; At one point, a member of the working group which
    is busy shaping American foreign policy decides to ask each member of the group if he or
    she votes. They all reply no. Motts adds that he does vote for the academy awards. Like I
    said&#151;it's the post democratic era of American politics.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Hoffman&#146;s performance ranks with his best in movies such as <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Midnight+Cowboy+(1969)"><em>Midnight Cowboy</em></a>
    and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Tootsie+(1982)"><em>Tootsie</em></a>. He
    shows the narcissistic Motts to be a very ordinary, even boring, man in most aspects of
    his life. His conversations are collages of self-congratulatory anecdotes and moral
    cliches. Yet when he starts to work with a &quot;story line&quot;, he is nothing less than
    a genius. This reminds me of the many mutant geniuses of the late twentieth
    Century&#151;from Stephen Spielberg to Bill Gates. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">I won&#146;t divulge the ending, but it&#146;s impressive that
    Levinson never tries to sweeten his message with a &quot;romantic angle&quot; or a
    contrived happy ending. Typical of the movie&#146;s bite is a scene in which Motts
    responds to a criticism of a television speech he has written for the President. The
    President thinks it's &quot;corny.&quot; Motts replies, &quot;of course, it&#146;s
    corny.&quot; It's for an American audience. He then insists on having 30 secretaries
    listen to him read the speech; he reduces them all to tears. Like I said- it&#146;s a
    black comedy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Of course, the question remains how &quot;real&quot; the movie is.
    Could it actually happen? The dialogue suggests that it could, pointing to how quickly the
    phony war in Grenada followed the deaths of 246 marines in Beirut and how Americans were
    sold the Gulf War by repeated showings of a &quot;smart&quot; bomb descending a smoke
    stack in Iraq. Of course, we know it couldn&#146;t happen here. Still I can&#146;t help
    happening to notice that along with headlines in <em>The New York Times</em> about
    Clinton&#146;s sexual problems we also see small stories in the back pages saying that the
    U.S. is &quot;losing patience&quot; with Saddam Hussein. A war with Iraq? You read it here
    first.</font></p>
