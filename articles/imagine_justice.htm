    <td valign="top"><h1><font face="Verdana">Imagine... Justice</font></h1>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana"><em>by Wilda L. White </em></font></strong>(November 1997)</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Jake Brigance, the young (white) lawyer short on experience but
    long on bravado in the movie <i>A Time to Kill</i>, tells us he took the case of a black
    man who killed two white men who raped and brutalized his ten-year old daughter &quot;to
    prove that a black man can receive a fair trial in the South.&quot; Yet <i>A Time to Kill</i>
    says much more about the filmmaker&#146;s view of justice and the American legal system
    than it does about race and racism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Set in Canton, Mississippi in 1995, <i>A Time to Kill, </i>is a
    cynical update of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?To+Kill+a+Mockingbird+(1962)"><i>To
    Kill a Mockingbird</i></a>, the 1962 film set in 1930's Maycomb, Alabama. In <i>To Kill a
    Mockingbird</i>, a black man is wrongfully convicted of raping a white woman. In <i>A Time
    to Kill</i>, an admittedly guilty man gets away with cold-blooded murder. That a white man
    guilty of the same would be acquitted justifies the black man&#146;s acquittal is the
    film&#146;s message.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">At the 1962 release of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, many anointed
    a hero the film&#146;s defense attorney, Atticus Finch (Oscar-winner Gregory Peck). He
    accepted the controversial case without hesitation, stood down a mob intent on lynching
    his client before trial, and lived his conviction that &quot;our courts are the great
    levelers; all men are created equal.&quot; Despite Finch&#146;s best efforts, his client
    is convicted by an all-white, male jury notwithstanding its belief in the defendant&#146;s
    innocence. The defendant is later killed while trying to escape. Upon learning of his
    client&#146;s death, Finch remarks: &quot;The last thing I told him was not to lose heart.
    We&#146;d ask for an appeal. &#133; we had more than a good chance.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">A <em>Time to Kill&#146;s</em> Jake Brigance embodies the 90's
    hero. Brigance is as practical as Finch is idealistic. &quot;<em>What I am not,</em>&quot;
    he drawls to his northern, anti-death penalty prospective law clerk, &quot;is a
    card-carrying ACLU radical. &#133; The only problem with the death penalty is that we do
    not use it enough.&quot; Brigance does not believe in &quot;forgiveness or
    rehabilitation.&quot; He professes a belief, rather, in &quot;safety and justice.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But no one in this film believes in justice, certainly not enough
    to follow its dictates or trust its determination. During a visit to Brigance&#146;s
    office shortly before gunning down the rapists, the defendant recalls the case of
    &quot;four white boys who raped a black girl over in the Delta last year.&quot; &quot;They
    got off, didn&#146;t they,&quot; he asks rhetorically. During the same meeting, the
    defendant exacts Brigance&#146;s promise to represent him should he &quot;get in a
    jam.&quot; During a jailhouse conference after the killings, the defendant speaks not of
    justice but of &quot;getting off.&quot; Even Brigance confides that had his daughter been
    raped he too would have circumvented the justice system.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The only relation people in this film have to justice is
    circumventing and distorting it. &quot;Justice is and will be colorblind,&quot; the
    politically ambitious prosecutor declares immediately before engaging in jury tampering to
    keep black people off the jury. While the judge concedes that &quot;it is impossible to
    find a fair and impartial jury in Mississippi,&quot; he denies Brigance&#146;s motion to
    move the trial and strikes a deal with the appeals court to insure his ruling is not
    reversed. The sheriff clubs a Klansman who is caught trying to bomb Brigance&#146;s home.
    The same sheriff stands by while Brigance adds his own licks. Brigance&#146;s law clerk
    burglarizes the office of the State&#146;s expert witness to obtain impeachment evidence.
    A sheriff&#146;s deputy, in concert with his KKK confederates, kidnaps and tortures
    Brigance&#146;s law clerk. In a straw poll, the jury decides on guilt before all the
    evidence is presented, ignoring the judge&#146;s admonition to the contrary. The jury
    changes its mind only after Brigance&#146;s emotional closing argument where he describes
    graphically the brutalization of the defendant&#146;s daughter and then asks the jury to
    &quot;<i>imagine</i> she&#146;s white.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Yet in the film&#146;s view, justice has prevailed because a black
    man who killed his daughter&#146;s rapists received the same latitude a white man would
    have received for the same crime. Lost on the filmmaker is that neither vigilante should
    be acquitted. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">While it may be &quot;fair&quot; to treat black and white
    defendants equally, <i>A Time to Kill</i> comes no closer to delivering justice than <i>To
    Kill a Mockingbird</i>. Truth. The sanctity of life. The rule of law. None is vindicated.
    Each movie teaches that our nation still has a long way to go towards not only achieving
    justice, but conceiving it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Imagine prosecutors seeking the truth. Imagine judges applying the
    law. Imagine juries basing their verdicts on the evidence. Imagine vigilantes, white or
    black, held accountable for their crimes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Only then can we talk about justice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small><strong>Editor's note:&nbsp; In a recent interview, John
    Grisham seemed to apologize for condoning vigilantism in <i>A Time to Kill</i>, his first
    novel.&nbsp; You can hear the February 28, 1997 interview in digital audio on the web site
