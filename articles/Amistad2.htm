    <p><strong><font face="Verdana"><em>By Martin Mhando</em>, Murdoch University, Perth, West
    Australia (February 1998)</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">To date many film reviews of <i>Amistad </i>have rightly
    highlighted the essence of humanity in the indictment of American history and justice in
    the film. Amid fewer critical voices against this particular telling of a `Black&#146;
    story, since I guess it is an American story first in the eyes of Spielberg, the film
    ought to be taken seriously to heart as it discusses an even more ominous issue&#151;that
    of having or not having a voice. Spielberg has taken up the issue of the freedom of speech
    to its metaphoric level- that of speaking a different tongue, a different voice hence ones
    inability to be heard. </font></p>
    <i><p></i><font face="Verdana">The film is one of extraordinary poignancy. It tells the
    story of Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), and his fellow slaves&#146; attempt at freedom after
    killing the crew of the slave ship Amistad. With only two remaining crew members to
    captain the ship back to Sierra Leone, as Cinque reckons, the ship is captured in America
    with its cargo of semi free slaves.</font><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Now imagine this. It is 1839, slavery has been abolished in the
    North and the South is ready and willing to go to war on the issue. It only needs a spark
    to fire the bush. Spielberg pits a failed American president against another irascible
    president culminating into the `trial of the century&#146;. The slaves have to argue their
    case against re-enslavement on the basis that they are from Africa and therefore according
    to American law they are free people, against the argument that since they were on a
    Spanish ship and because nobody can prove that slave trading continues in Sierra Leone the
    slaves are the property of Queen Isabella of Spain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film follows the efforts of a novice lawyer, Baldwin (Mathew
    McConaughey), and Joadson, (Morgan Freeman), an abolitionist, to free the slaves and help
    them go back to Sierra Leone. Except there is a major hurdle: the slaves speak a Mende
    dialect which no one can understand, making it hard to plead a case, until a Mende
    speaker, an earlier arrival to the American shores, is able to translate between lawyer
    and clients. As the case moves to the Supreme court the renowned lawyer and former US
    President Martin Van Buren (Anthony Hopkins) is drafted to the defense leading to one of
    the most memorable court scenes in cinema. In a grueling 15 minute speech (the real one is
    said to have run a total of eight and a half hours) Spielberg risks all and delivers a
    tour de force of acting, drama and cinema from the legal argument by Hopkins.</font></p>
    <i><p></i><font face="Verdana">The film is in fact a romantic representation of American
    justice consistent with classical Hollywood&#146;s narrative. However, Spielberg is able
    to bring the deep racial thesis of the film to its appropriate political level denying
    liberal America their usual site of control of the cultural encounter. By questioning the
    right of forcing the slaves to defend themselves in a language they don&#146;t understand,
    in a legal system they don&#146;t understand, Spielberg is undergoing the Socratic self
    examination in which one is able to argue for an opinion that one does not even believe
    in. He is forcing the viewer towards a narrative imagination: to think how it would be in
    someone else&#146;s shoes and in that way get the imagination going. A hard task indeed.
    Finally, Spielberg joins Bob Marley&#146;s world citizenship by debating together about
    world issues rather than local issues, suggesting the need to study things quite
    unfamiliar to one&#146;s corner of the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Although Cinque doesn&#146;t speak English, when he says `Give us
    Free&#146; we hear its translation in the myriad of languages of the world and understand
    its power. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The scenes of violence that others have praised as being
    `visceral&#146;, `in your face&#146;, `heartrendingly graphic images committed to
    film&#146; were to me the weakest cinematic devices in the film. I think the film would
    have worked just as well without those graphic tear jerking scenes. Further, the animal
    metaphor in describing both the slave and the slaver does not work for me. It is too
    convenient, and used a set a set of pre-associated images, generic and stereotypic. There
    is enough grace and ferocity in the story, in the characters, in history, to enable us to
    relive those memories. This mythologising of representation affords easy passage to
    mis-remembering rather than remembering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">As an African I was not totally taken in with the emotional bits
    of the boat and the massacres. I think I have been inured by such images. However, what
    impressed me most is Spielberg&#146;s identifying of the lowest common denominator of
    dispossession, of absolute powerlessness that any person can find themselves in. I
    identify with Cinque through the position of powerlessness that I have often found myself
    in. May it then be said that <i>Amistad</i> rises to the level of a parable of the
    powerless. May we read in there the story of Africa&#146;s powerlessness economically,
    where no language exists between what the IMF&#146;s tomorrow means to many African
    countries which find themselves in this powerless bind. May we even then read in it the
    parable of the weak `Arab&#146; nation, as they watch over their riches and history being
    turned into a laughing spectacle. Or even the Indonesians who had seemed to do the right
    thing (knew the language) until when the roof fell on them and rendered them
    powerless....Which measure of justice shall we use?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">It is only through the hegemonic relationship existing between
    western philosophy (dominating not dominant philosophy) and other cultural philosophies,
    that we can explain why we seem to agree with the court&#146;s decision. The discourse of
    the law is the discourse of authority. Law is always used as a mediating factor between
    right and wrong, right and might, truth and falsity. However, Cinque&#146;s disruptive
    associative linguistic windfall supported by a subversive interval within western
    capitalism (in the form of the historical material time of pre-civil war) won the day for
    humanity. It is a lesson that needs to be remembered, that the cat might meow but the dog
    is yet to have its day.</font></p>
