    <td valign="top" height="566" width="632"><h1><font face="Verdana"><i>The Gingerbread Man</i>:
    A Lawyer Thriller Fails in Both Genres</font></h1>
    <p><strong><em><font face="Verdana">by Michael Asimow and Paul Bergman, UCLA Law School </font></em></strong>(April
    1998)</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Rick Magruder (Kenneth Branagh) is an arrogant Savannah defense
    attorney whose office is celebrating a big victory. He befriends Mallory Doss (Embeth
    Davidtz) who works for the caterer. Soon thereafter, they&#146;re in bed. And soon after
    that, Rick is handling pro bono a competency hearing in which Mallory is trying to
    institutionalize her crazy father (Robert Duvall).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Needless to say, however, Mallory has another agenda entirely. In
    a plot inspired by <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Double+Indemnity+(1944)"><i>Double
    Indemnity</i></a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Body+Heat+(1981)"><i>Body
    Heat</i></a>, she entangles Rick in an elaborate scheme the details of which won&#146;t be
    disclosed here. Suffice it to say that this movie belongs in the thriller genre, not the
    legal genre. And for us, at least, the thriller plot was murky and highly implausible.
    Thus we can&#146;t recommend this film either for fans of lawyer movies or of thrillers.
    However, the film is capably directed by Robert Altman and beautifully photographed; the
    Savannah locations and Hurricane Geraldo are well executed (it <i>really</i> rains in the
    second half of this flic). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">John Grisham is credited with writing the original story; the
    screenplay is credited to the pseudonymous Al Hayes, who may be Altman himself. There were
    apparently serious creative differences, including a major tussle between Altman and
    Polygram (which took the picture from him, recut it, and ultimately allowed him to release
    his original version). In our view, the disjointed plotting falls well below
    Grisham&#146;s standards (the authors of this posting disagree on whether or not
    Grisham&#146;s usual plots are pretty clever). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">We focus here on the portrait of Rick as a lawyer. On the good
    side, he is a caring non-custodial parent of two young kids. He works hard to make his
    visits meaningful and heroically defends his kids when the bad guys place them in danger.
    He&#146;s also a generous and caring attorney. Seeing Mallory apparently in danger from
    her father, he and his associate Lois spent thousands of dollars of uncompensated time
    having him institutionalized. And when this fails (dad breaks out of the loonybin), Rick
    goes to great lengths to protect her. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Nevertheless, there are bad sides to Rick Magruder. He is harsh,
    condescending, sometimes cruel to his employees&#151;his office receptionist, his
    investigator, and his associate Lois. Failing to treat fellow workers with respect is a
    serious failing of many lawyers and it is well depicted here. Taking on Mallory&#146;s
    competency case, while conducting an affair with her, is deeply problematic. Lawyers need
    to separate their client representation from their love life; the consequences of failing
    to do so are often dire, as numerous films such as <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Jagged+Edge+(1985)"><i>Jagged Edge</i></a> have
    shown. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Worst of all, Rick displays poor judgment about people and
    situations and frequently behaves quite impulsively. As Altman said in a recent interview,
    Rick is &quot;the kind of lawyer I don&#146;t like. He&#146;s a killer in the courtroom,
    but the minute he gets outside his own element, he&#146;s dog meat.&quot; In short, Rick
    isn&#146;t someone you&#146;d want to refer clients to.</font></p>
