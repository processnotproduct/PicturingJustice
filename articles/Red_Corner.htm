    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana">Red Corner</font></h1>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><em><strong>by John Denvir, USF Law School</strong>&nbsp; </em>(November
    1997)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><i>Red Corner</i> has a good idea for a film&#151;part Hitchcock
    adventure thriller and part legal melodrama. But somehow it never comes off.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The &quot;thriller&quot; part works well enough. Richard Gere
    plays Jack Moore, an American corporate lawyer in Beijing to close a multi-million dollar
    satellite tv deal. He is all poise and charm, like a bargain basement version of Cary
    Grant in the beginning of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?North+by+Northwest+(1959)"><i>North by Northwest</i></a>.
    When asked if he became a lawyer because of all the money, he replies &quot;No, I wanted
    to be in control.&quot; But, of course, like Grant he soon loses control when he wakes up
    one morning soaked in blood next to a dead young female model he has met the night before.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">And that&#146;s where the legal melodrama begins&#151;
    &quot;accused&quot; Moore enters the Kafkian labyrinths of the Chinese legal system.
    Unfortunately, the legal melodrama portion of the film just doesn&#146;t work very well.
    But I think the reason for this failure is interesting because it shows us in a negative
    way what makes good legal melodramas so engrossing. <i>Red Corner&#146;s</i> depiction of
    the Chinese legal system lacks all the most effective dramatic gimmicks of the
    conventional Hollywood trial .</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">First, in Moore trial we don&#146;t have a crowded courtroom
    buzzing with anticipation at the big events to transpire. Remember Scout and Jem sneaking
    into the crowded courthouse in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?To+Kill+a+Mockingbird+(1962)"><i>To Kill A
    Mockingbird</i></a>. Director Jon Avnet shows us a large empty dreary courtroom with no
    one in attendance except the defendant, judge, and lawyers. I imagine he does this to
    dramatize the fact that Chinese trials are not public, but the dramatic consequence is to
    make the trial look like a routine bureaucratic procedure&#151; ironically much like a
    routine American trial which Hollywood studiously avoids. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Secondly, we don&#146;t have the advantage of a jury for the
    camera to shift to for &quot;reaction&quot; shots. In the normal American trial melodrama,
    the viewer is always interested in whether the jury is getting the same message from the
    trial as the viewer. Here there&#146;s no jury. Also, there is no chance for the
    spell-binding final argument to the jury. Remember Al Pacino in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?%2E%2E%2EAnd+Justice+for+All+(1979)"><i>And Justice
    for All</i></a> or Paul Newman in <a href="Verdict.htm"><i>The Verdict</i></a>. Here
    Moore&#146;s lawyer, when she is allowed to argue at all, speaks in respectful tones to a
    stony-faced judge, a little bit like a bored law student.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">We also miss the drama of cross-examination. Remember Jimmy
    Stewart and George C. Scott grilling opposing witnesses in<i> <a href="anatomy.htm">Anatomy
    of a Murder</a></i>. In <i>Red Corner</i>, Gere once in a while shouts out a hostile
    question to a witness, but after the translation everyone just looks at him like he&#146;s
    showing the terribly bad form one expects from a Westerner. No tearful confessions from
    hectored witnesses in Beijing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Finally, I think the key ideological ingredient in the Hollywood
    portrayal of the American system of justice is the expectation that justice will be
    served. That&#146;s why people were so outraged by the O. J. Simpson trial; they had been
    taught to believe the system worked. The legal melodrama assumes that the whole story will
    played out before the jury which in its wisdom will decide what is true and grant justice.
    Remember <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?12+Angry+Men+(1957)"><i>12 Angry Men</i></a>.
    But here Avnet wishes to show that the corrupt Chinese system is not interested in
    justice. This may be true as fact, but it makes for poor drama because if the trial is a
    farce why are we bothering watching it? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The dramatic potential of the American trial raises an interesting
    question. Do we see so many movies about trials because quest for justice is so central to
    America&#146;s conception of itself or do we see them because movie directors can&#146;t
    resist the built-in dramatic structure of the jury trial? Maybe it&#146;s both.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One last point. I don&#146;t have the same concern with legal
    verisimilitude as my co-webitor Rob Waring (See his review of <a href="larry_flynt.htm"><i>The
    People v. Larry Flynt</i></a> in the <a href="../archive.htm">PJ ARCHIVE</a>) but I do
    wonder if Avnet has gone over the line here. He shows the Chinese criminal system to be
    corrupt, and as well it might be . But I doubt that the actual Chinese system (based on a
    civil law model) looks very much like what Avnet has portrayed in the film. The film shows
    us a truncated adverserial model. If I am correct ( and perhaps some reader will correct
    me), the system the film implicitly condemns is really a product of the director&#146;s
    imagination.&nbsp; Is that just?</font></p>
