    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana">Bulworth</font></h1>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana"><em>by Robert L. Waring </em></font></strong>(June 1998)</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">To join the chorus of praise for Warren Beatty's film <i>Bulworth</i>,
    let me say that he has made an imaginative, funny and thought provoking film. It seems he
    set out to write, direct, produce and star in a political comedy and has succeeded on
    those terms.&nbsp;In the film, Senator Jay Bulworth (Beatty), an old guard liberal running
    for reelection, is so disgusted with what he has become that he obtains a ten million
    dollar life insurance payable to his daughter and hires a hit man to kill him. &nbsp;
    Knowing he is going to die frees him to say what he really thinks about politics in
    America.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">After his reformation, Senator Bulworth has many profound and
    troubling comments on the sorry state of the present attitude of most politicians towards
    racial and economic inequality. (You don't contribute money to my campaign, you don't
    matter.) He also exposes white audiences to manifestations of alienation many blacks feel
    towards American society. Unfortunately, <i>Bulworth</i> appears to be a wasted
    opportunity. Senator Bulworth mostly comes across as a raving lunatic, and thus his
    observant ramblings are likely to be perceived by many as more reminiscent of Richard
    Pryor rather than Huey Newton.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film gives Senator Bulworth (a sort of Hunter J. Thompson
    impersonator) a landslide victory in the election. Beatty apparently believes, or at least
    wants his audience to believe, that the electorate will support an outrageous (gonzo)
    cynic. Here, it is Beatty's stereotype of voters that is way out. I think the experiences
    of the few bold liberals who have dared to speak their minds in election campaigns in the
    last thirty years are more telling. Take, for example, Jerry Brown, who ran for President
    in 1992. He was perceived by many to be a lunatic, though not as extreme as the foaming at
    the mouth lunacy evidenced by Beatty's Bulworth. Jerry Brown was practically run out of
    town on a rail. No one has seriously suggested that if Brown had appeared even crazier he
    would have fared better in the election.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The message I got loud and clear from <i>Bulworth</i> is this most
    voters do a dysfunctional dance with those they elect. They want politicians who promise
    to fix the system, but in the end, they really do not want any serious tinkering done.
    Call it cynicism from the &quot;big government&quot; era of the sixties or from centuries
    of corrupt government leaders, if you will, but I think the roots go much deeper. People
    are scared of change&#150;the devil they don't know is more terrifying than the devil they
    do know&#150;but they do not want to admit it. They want promises, but they really don't
    want to see laws enacted to deliver on those promises. The one exception to the above
    seems to be in the criminal justice system, which only serves to illustrate how fear is
    the biggest voter motivator today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">This movie may strike a chord with voters, however, in reinforcing
    the illusion that they have the guts to elect a maverick such as Bulworth to a position of
    power and obscuring the fact they lack that courage. Like many of the images in <i>Bulworth</i>,
    it's a distorted reflection.</font></p>
