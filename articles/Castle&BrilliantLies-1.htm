    <td valign="TOP" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana">The Castle and Brilliant Lies</font><a name="TOP"></a></h1>
    <p><b><font face="Verdana"><i>by Stan Ross, University of New South Wales School of Law </i>(January
    1998)</font></b>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Late last year I was given by a former classmate, Michael Asimow,
    his latest book. The book, <a href="http://www.law.ucla.edu/faculty/asimow/book"><i>Reel
    Justice: The Courtroom Goes to the Movies </i>(1996)</a><i> </i>by Paul Bergman and
    Michael Asimow published by Andrews and McMeel and distributed by Penguin Books in
    Australia, looks at 69 trial movies. It gives each one a rating from four gavels (a
    classic) down to one gravel (ask for a new trial). Among the thirteen with a top rating is
    the famous Australian film, <i><a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?%27Breaker%27+Morant+(1980)">Breaker Morant</a></i>
    (1980). Another Australian film, <i><a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Prisoners+of+the+Sun+(1990)">Prisoners of the Sun</a></i>
    - known in Australia as <i>Blood Oath </i>(1990), also received a high three gavels
    rating. The book is written for lawyers and non-lawyers. For the latter there is a special
    section to help clarify the complicated legal doctrine on the hearsay rule and for lawyers
    and non-lawyers an interesting one on the prejudice against women lawyers.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The book outlines the plot for each film and does an analysis of
    the accuracy of the legal doctrines and arguments presented by the script writers. I found
    as its most interesting aspect the discussion of ethical and moral dilemmas which are
    often most vividly portrayed in trial movies. As the authors state: &quot;Should a lawyer
    represent a client that the lawyer thinks is guilty? What if the client might kill again?
    Must a lawyer represent a client who is extremely unpopular or who has a repulsive
    personality or who can't pay a fee or who doesn't even want a lawyer?&quot;</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Many Australian lawyers who see trial movies will comment on the
    accuracy of the legal analysis, but I believe few will look closely at the ethical and
    moral issues. Two recent Australian films present a number of these issues. They are <i>Brilliant
    Lies </i>(1996) and <i>The Castle </i>(1997). In <i>Brilliant Lies </i>the complainant is
    seeking compensation for being sexually harassed by her boss. Her main objective is to
    receive an unusually large sum in compensation for this type of case. We are shown in
    detail the mediation system that brings pressure on the litigants to reach a fair and
    harmonious solution, but doesn't work in this situation because of the hidden story. Both
    the complainant and the defendant lie to their lawyers and the true story is only revealed
    during the administrative tribunal hearing. There are interesting insights into the
    lawyer-client relationship, showing how clients can manipulate their lawyers. The film has
    broader social moral and ethical issues and it has an excellent script based on a play of
    the same name written by David Williamson (<i>co-scriptwriter: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Year+of+Living+Dangerously%2C+The+(1983)">The Year
    of Living Dangerously</a></i>)</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The second film, <i>The Castle</i>, was a tremendous hit at the
    box office in Australia. [The film has not yet attracted a distributor in the U.S.A.] It
    is a wonderful Australian comedy played by the team from the television satirical program <i><a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?%22Frontline%22+(1994)">Frontline</a></i>. In <i>Frontline
    </i>we are often presented with ethical and moral issues faced by a television news
    program. In <i>The Castle</i>, the <i>Frontline </i>team have turned their critical eye on
    the legal system. When the family home is threatened by the Commonwealth government&#146;s
    need to expand an airport, the family <a href="http://wwlia.org/dict-s.htm#S">solicitor</a>
    is immediately consulted. The problem is that his practice almost totally involves
    non-litigious matters such as conveyancing, wills, probate etc.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The solicitor at first rightfully turns down representation
    because he lacks competence in this area. The Law Council of Australia Model Rules, r 1.1
    states: &quot;A practitioner must act ... with competence and diligence in the service of
    a client, and should accept instructions, and a retainer to act for a client only when the
    practitioner can reasonably expect to serve the client in that manner....&quot; The client
    pleads with the solicitor to take the case because his home is his castle and no money
    compensation can replace its value. The solicitor is persuaded to take the matter and is
    totally unprepared and inept in presenting the case. Of course he loses.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">It is only when a retired Queen's Counsel [a sort of
    super-barrister] befriends the client and takes over the appeal on a <i>pro bono </i>basis
    that the client receives competent legal representation. Although this is a very dubious
    appeal to the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au./">High Court</a>, based on the
    constitutional interpretation of &quot;just terms,&quot; it highlights the role of the
    divided profession. During the hearing it looks like the solicitor is helping the QC by
    passing him a note, but the note ask whether he wants a glass of water. <i>The Castle </i>depicts
    the stereotype image of solicitors as being unable to do litigious work. This is no longer
    true as many more solicitors are doing advocacy work. It also shows the Bar [barristers]
    in glowing light, with the expert QC saving the family home through his skilled advocacy
    and legal knowledge.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The rule on competence is not clear as to whether a solicitor who
    lacks knowledge in a particular area can still represent the client by receiving an advice
    from a barrister or by briefing a barrister to take over the representation. Obviously,
    the client will thus receive expert legal advice, but at an inflated cost, as compared to
    having a solicitor, for example as needed in <i>The Castle </i>situation, who is an expert
    on litigation.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Films like <i>The Castle </i>are excellent educational tools. They
    help us define our own ethics and morals not only within the professional relationship but
    also in the broader context of our society.</font></p>
