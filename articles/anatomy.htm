    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1>Anatomy of a Murder&#150;<em>The &quot;Lecture&quot;</em></h1>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><em><strong>By Michael Asimow, UCLA Law School</strong> </em>(February
    1998)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film<i> Anatomy of a Murder</i> (1959) is probably the finest
    pure trial movie ever made. The film is based on a powerful 1958 novel by Robert Traver
    (the pseudonym of Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker). It centers on a
    gripping small-town murder trial of Lieutenant Manion (Ben Gazzara). Manion clearly gunned
    down Barney Quill in Quill&#146;s bar. But <i>why</i> did he do it? Icy prosecutor Claude
    Dancer (George C. Scott in an awesome debut) claims it happened in a jealous rage when
    Manion found out that his wife Laura (a very sexy Lee Remick) and Quill were having an
    affair. Homespun defense lawyer Paul Biegler (Jimmy Stewart in an unforgettable portrayal)
    would rather be catching trout. He claims it happened because Manion was seized by an
    irresistible impulse&#150;he just found out that Quill had raped Laura after picking her
    up in the bar. The trial is a slam-bang affair with wonderful twists and turns, always
    informed by a deep understanding of the unexpected dilemmas and quick decisions that
    confront every litigator .</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film is loaded with fascinating legal issues, such as the
    validity and applicability of the irresistible impulse version of the insanity defense. It
    raises numerous issues of trial practice, tactics, and ethics. It poses the issue of
    whether a cross-examiner should ever ask a question to which he doesn&#146;t know the
    answer. The sensational jazz score was written by Duke Ellington. The wise-owl judge was
    played by Joseph N. Welch, who won fame representing the Army in the Army-McCarthy
    hearings of the early 50's.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In his famous &quot;lecture,&quot; Biegler skates close to the
    line of unethical witness coaching&#151;that is, knowingly altering a witness&#146; story
    about the events in question. When Biegler first meets Manion in jail, he manages to
    overcome the client&#146;s intense mistrust and then the discussion turns to whether the
    client has a defense. How far can counsel go in suggesting a defense to a client who
    hasn&#146;t a clue? And should the lawyer discuss possible defenses <i>before</i> asking
    the client what happened? Because once the client has told the attorney his story, that
    freezes the client&#146;s version of the facts; it&#146;s too late to mold the facts to
    fit a particular defense.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Clearly it is improper to assist the client to make up facts that
    never occurred. Model Rule 3.4(b) states that a lawyer must not &quot;counsel or assist a
    witness to testify falsely.&quot; But it&#146;s perfectly OK (indeed obligatory) for
    counsel to interview a witness and to discuss his testimony in order to assist the witness
    to testify effectively. And surely it is appropriate to tell a client what the law is,
    even if that suggests a defense to the client that he might not have realized was
    available. The problem is that a clever attorney can convey an implicit message to a
    witness that alters the witness&#146; testimony&#151;without ever coming out and actually
    telling the witness to do it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In the film, Biegler is obviously quite aware of the limits on
    witness coaching but most observers think he stayed on the ethical side of the line.
    Without first asking Manion exactly what happened, he tells Manion about the categories of
    justification and excuse and rules out each possible claim. For example, killing in the
    defense of another is a possible justification&#151;but not an hour after the purported
    rape occurred. Biegler also nixes the &quot;unwritten law&quot; which allows you to kill
    someone whom you discover in flagrante with your spouse. Not recognized as a defense in
    Michigan, unfortunately.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">So Biegler keeps Manion guessing until Manion says &quot;I must
    have been mad.&quot; Sorry, bad temper isn&#146;t a defense. &quot;No,&quot; says Manion,
    &quot;I must have been crazy. &quot; &quot;Well, Lieutenant,&quot; replies Biegler, as he
    steps from the room, &quot;in the meantime, see if you can remember how crazy you
    were.&quot; So the client comes up with the defense, albeit with a bit of gentle prodding
    from the attorney, and either remembers or fabricates the facts to support that defense.
    We&#146;ve screened this scene before quite a few audiences, and hardly any attorneys have
    ever voted to discipline Biegler, even though it seems quite likely that Manion&#146;s
    testimony is different than it would have been in the absence of the lecture and that
    Biegler intended exactly that.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In the book however, Biegler goes a step further. The suggestion
    for the insanity defense comes from <i>Biegler</i>, not from <i>Manion</i>. Speaking in
    the first person, Biegler recounts his conversation with his client: &quot; &#145;Then,
    finally there&#146;s the defense of insanity.&#146; I paused, and spoke abruptly, airily:
    &#145;Well, that just about winds it up.&#146; &quot; Then Manion starts asking questions
    about insanity. Biegler plays dumb and answers the questions, but tells the reader:
    &quot;My naivete was somewhat excessive; it had been obvious to me from merely reading the
    newspaper the night before that insanity was the best, if not the only, legal defense the
    man had. And here I&#146;d just slammed shut every other escape hatch and told him this
    was the last. Only a cretin could have missed it, and I was rapidly learning that
    Lieutenant Manion was no cretin.&quot; (Pp. 45-46)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">It can be argued that, in the book&#146;s version, Biegler
    overstepped the line by coaching his client right into a made-up defense. See Richard C.
    Wydick, <i>The Ethics of Witness Coaching</i>, 17 Cardozo L. Rev. 1, 25-27 (1995). The
    movie, however, is more subtle. The client comes up with the defense, but obviously with a
    lot of covert help from his lawyer. What do you think? Did Biegler cross the line in
    either the book or the movie? Or have the ethical rules about witness coaching departed so
    far from actual practice that they&#146;ve become irrelevant? Do we now tolerate any sort
    of coaching short of telling the client to lie?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">It&#146;s very rare for an attorney to be punished (criminally or
    ethically) for witness coaching, because the offense occurs in private. Yet current events
    in the nation&#146;s capitol remind us that subornation of perjury isn&#146;t always a
    well-kept little secret. The great film <i>Anatomy of a Murder </i>makes us focus on the
    elusive distinctions between appropriate witness preparation and inappropriate coaching.</font></p>
