    <p><font face="Verdana"><strong><em>by John Denvir, USF Law School </em></strong>(May
    1998)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Peter Weir is known for some excellent Hollywood commercial films;
    <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Witness+(1985)"><i>Witness</i></a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Year+of+Living+Dangerously%2C+The+(1983)"><i>The
    Year of Living Dangerously</i></a> come to mind. But as a young man he made more
    challenging films in his native Australia. One, <i>The Last Wave</i>, gives a perspective
    on law we don't find in Hollywood films.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film's plot sounds simple enough. A young lawyer, David Burton
    (Richard Chamberlain working off his success as <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?%22Dr%2E+Kildare%22+(1961)"><i>Doctor Kildare</i></a>),
    lives the bourgeois life to which so many male law students aspire. He's a tax lawyer with
    a handsome wife, two beautiful little girls, and nice house in the suburbs of Sydney. He
    even does a little <i>pro bono</i> on the side, representing indigents in the criminal
    courts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Legal Aid asks Burton to represent four Aborigine youths who are
    accused of killing another Aborigine in a drunken brawl. Burton accepts the case and then
    layer after layer of &quot;law&quot; starts to unpeel. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">First, Chamberlain discovers that his clients are &quot;tribal
    people&quot; who still practice the traditional Aboriginal rites. In fact, the killing was
    in retribution for the victim's stealing of certain sacred stones, and the weapon was not
    a knife or a gun, but a shaman's pointing of a bone at the victim which caused his heart
    to stop beating. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The first interesting &quot;legal&quot; question is whether
    pointing a bone at someone with the intent to kill can be &quot;murder&quot; under
    Australian law. But then we also have a question about the interface of legal cultures
    since to the Australian government the crime is theft, but to the tribal Aborigines it's
    sacrilege which can only be punished by death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But to me, the even more interesting question is the connection
    between the temporal secular law of Australia and the law of &quot;dream
    time&quot;&#151;the atemporal psychic space which the Aborigines feel to be more
    &quot;real&quot; than temporal reality. Chamberlain pleads with one of the defendants to
    tell the truth so he can get him off, he makes a comment any liberal western lawyer might
    make: &quot;Surely people are more important than the law.&quot; But the Aborigine quickly
    corrects him: &quot;No, the law is more important than man.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">He of course is not talking about the penal code, but law in some
    more ultimate sense. Finally Burton finds out that he too has a connection to that larger
    &quot;law&quot; with which we seem to have lost touch. Should we be searching for it? Or
    is it just a dream?</font></p>
