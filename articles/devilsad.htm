    <td valign="top"><h1><font face="Verdana">The Devil's Advocate</font></h1>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><strong><em>by Robert L. Waring </em></strong>(November 1997)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Every once in a while, a film comes along that is a
    lawyer-film-reviewer&#146;s dream. <i>The Devil&#146;s Advocate</i> is such a film. As a
    lawyer-film-reviewer, my focus is usually on how a film may shape non-lawyers&#146;
    perceptions of law, the legal system and lawyers. In this case, it is obvious that the
    screen writers and director hate lawyers. So does much of the American public. (I do not
    recommend this as a first date movie for a lawyer and a non-lawyer.) Even though the
    message of the film seems to be that our society would be better off if more lawyers took
    a bullet in the head, another lawyer-bashing movie is not going to do much more damage to
    the tarnished image of the bar at this point. What I found more interesting about <i>The
    Devil&#146;s Advocate</i> is that it seemed to be speaking directly to the legal
    profession more pointedly that the usual anti-lawyer movie.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film, a modern morality play, is full of surprises, highly
    entertaining and probably destined to become a classic&#151;at law schools, at any rate.
    Although borrowing much from the horror genre (Director Taylor Hackford also directed <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Dolores+Claiborne+(1994)"><i>Dolores Claiborne</i></a>.),
    the plot seems most inspired by John Grisham&#146;s <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Firm%2C+The+(1993)"><i>The Firm</i></a>. A young
    hotshot, played by Keanu Reeves, is recruited by a big law firm and lured into its web of
    mendacity. His beautiful wife, played by Charlize Theron, is at first seduced by their new
    affluence, but soon feels betrayed by her husband&#146;s all-consuming career. Anyone
    whose marriage has been damaged or destroyed by a legal career will find the wife&#146;s
    increasing distress painful to watch. (Theron is a terrific actress.) This film should be
    shown to all first year law students for this reason alone. It might save or prevent a few
    marriages.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The hotshot&#146;s boss, John Milton (an obvious nod to
    Renaissance author Milton&#146;s <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgibin/toccer?id=MilPL67&amp;tag=public&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/lv1/Archive/eng-parsed&amp;part=0"><i>Paradise
    Lost</i></a>), played by Al Pacino, is the devil. Some his best lines, and he has plenty,
    are near the end. When asked why he has chosen to do his Satanic work by working as a
    lawyer, he shouts, &quot;because it is the <em>ultimate</em> backstage pass. It&#146;s the
    new priesthood.&quot; He claims that as the devil (read lawyer), he owns what passes for
    the conscience of the Twentieth Century, a time ruled by greed and amorality. And lawyers,
    with their enormous egos, he opines, are center stage, now a part of every evil endeavor
    on the planet. He does have a point.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But the devil is saying more than just that lawyers are a part of
    the greed. The message, reinforced by the film&#146;s final plot twist, is that the
    ultimate backstage pass is ultimately corrupting. Even the hotshot, who throughout most of
    the movie appears to have a reasonably functional moral compass, turns out to have been
    engaging in a pattern of conduct that would subject him to disbarment were it to be
    discovered. The business of lawyering offers a wealth of immoral temptations that too many
    lawyers seem unable to resist. That is what the profession needs to hear and correct, or
    at least monitor more closely. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Viewing <i>The Devil&#146;s Advocate</i> should probably be a
    continuing education requirement for lawyers, especially if it were coupled with a
    requirement that each attorney watch the film with non-lawyers and listen to their
    comments afterwards. This ought to be worth something for CLE ethics credit. I saw the
    film in a crowded theater in San Francisco that I sensed was comprised of a
    disproportionately high percentage of law students and lawyers. I heard scattered nervous
    laughter and could feel the audience&#146;s embarrassment at some of the scenes and even
    bits of background dialog that hit too close to home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">My major problem with the film is its portrayal of the role of a
    criminal defense lawyer. The film judges the Reeves character harshly for applying his
    skill to gain the acquittal of a child molester he strongly suspected was guilty. In this
    post-OJ world of juror nullification, <i>The Devil&#146;s Advocate</i> seems to respond by
    calling for attorney nullification&#151;take a dive if you think your client is guilty.
    That is not the path towards reforming the profession.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In part because the hotshot here is a subspecies, a former
    prosecutor who defected to the other side, he is depicted as having enormous crises of
    conscience upon discovering that his clients may be guilty. I am not sure what the public
    expects, but somehow a vision of an ethical profession in which criminal defense lawyers
    can vigorously defend their clients, guilty or not, must be able to co-exist with a world
    where raping and pillaging by the civil bar is not tolerated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The setting for most of the devil&#146;s law firm&#146;s evil
    endeavors is arms smuggling and international finance. This global wrong-doing is
    presented together with the firm&#146;s one-lawyer criminal defense practice as if the
    same set of issues were involved. There is a vast difference between advocacy intended to
    prevent the state from depriving a person of liberty based on past actions versus advocacy
    which fosters an ongoing pattern of injury and economic exploitation. The danger of such
    mixing can be seen in Texas, where the rights of murderers are held in such poor regard
    that nearly all large and medium-sized law firms in the state refuse to take capital
    appeals in part out of fear that such an affiliation would hurt the rest of their
    business. If public tolerance of lawyers is this fragile, the solution lies in raising the
    conduct of the profession in general, not in lopping off some of the less politically
    acceptable public service work performed by lawyers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The profession needs to clean up its act, but if public anger over
    this translates into reduced advocacy for indigent criminal defendants (as it has already
    translated into reduced rights), we are all in trouble.</font></p>
