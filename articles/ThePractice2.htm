    <font face="Verdana"><em><strong><small><p></small>by Michael Asimow, UCLA Law School</strong>
    </em>(March 1998)</font><p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana">Fans of the excellent series <i>The Practice</i> are
    engaged in a boaring dispute about the use of a pig as a check. In the episode aired on
    February 9, Eugene represented a tax protestor in a criminal case who filed a correct
    Massachusetts tax return but refused to pay the tax. </font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana">The client turned loose a greased pig at the Revenue
    Department--which got the tax people mad enough to prosecute him after they had cleaned up
    the mess. On the pig was written the necessary elements of a check-&quot;pay to the order
    of the MA Revenue Department,&quot; the amount, and a signature. The court dismissed the
    case since the pig should be treated as payment, even though the state failed to catch the
    pig and cash it at the bank. Sow what, you ask? </font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana">I have consulted with my colleagues, negotiable
    instruments gurus Bill Warren and Ken Klee, to clarify this matter. Warren declared that
    the issue was too slippery to give an opinion, but observed that the case was in accord
    with the landmark English decision of <i>Board of Inland Revenue v. Haddock</i>. In that
    case, String, J. concluded that a cow bearing the words &quot;To the London and Literary
    Bank, Ltd.: Pay to the Collector of Taxes, who is no gentleman, or Order, the sum of
    fifty-seven pounds (and may he rot)&quot; was a negotiable instrument that could be
    endorsed over to any willing holder. While some may argue that <i>Haddock</i> is
    distinguishable as involving either a cow or a fish, rather than a pig, most would
    consider the case directly in point. </font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana">As a result, Warren noted, pigs might even be
    considered legal tender. He remarked, however, that some pigs he had eaten recently would
    not qualify. </font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana">Federal tax regulations require tax payments in the
    form of a check or money order, but do not seem to require that the check be written on
    paper. The regs do, however, allow the director to refuse to accept any personal check
    whenever he or she has good reason to believe that such check will not be honored upon
    presentment--the issue addressed below. Treas. Reg. Section 301.6311-1(a)(1)(i). As
    recently amended, the Code requires tax payments by &quot;any commercially acceptable
    means that the Secretary deems appropriate.&quot; IRC Section 6311(a). Future regulations
    might, therefore, rule that payment by pig is not commercially acceptable. Our research
    department is working on the question of whether Massachusetts has similar regulations.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana">What exactly would happen if the Revenue Department
    had captured the elusive swine, schlepped it down to the bank, and attempted to cash it?
    Undoubtedly, this will be a rather time-consuming transaction. In all likelihood, the
    Department's agent and the pig will be ahead of me in line at the bank. </font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana">Use of the ATM machine is not recommended when
    cashing a pig. It might cause ham to both pig and machine. </font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana">Klee believes that the drawee bank (i.e. the
    taxpayer's bank) would have to honor the check unless it had something in its customer
    agreement to the contrary. The collecting bank (i.e. the tax department's bank) would not
    be required to take the check, but if it did so as a favor to the department, it would be
    interesting to see how the Fed deals with this item in its interbank clearing process. </font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana">Klee adds the highly relevant observation that the
    use of the pig as a check should not cause someone who loaned money to the taxpayer on the
    security of the pig to lose his priority, even if the pig bounced. Losing one's priority
    is referred to in the trade as being &quot;primed,&quot; which in the case of a pig may
    also suggest a shortened life expectancy.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana">Once more, <i>The Practice</i> brings home the bacon.
    It wins high marks for an excellent and legally accurate script.</font></p>
