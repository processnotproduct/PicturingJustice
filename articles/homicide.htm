    <font face="Verdana"><p><strong><em>By John Denvir, University of San Francisco School of
    Law</em></strong> (October, 1998)</p>
    <b><p><small>[Editor&#146;s note: The following commentary reveals some plot details.
    &nbsp; Readers who have not seen the film may want to bookmark this site and return to
    read this commentary after they have seen the film.]</small></b><p>
    <p>&quot;Law,&quot; understood in any sense beyond coercion, presupposes community. We
    feel morally required to obey the laws of our community while the threat of sanctions is
    the only motivation for obeying laws promulgated by a government we don&#146;t consider
    our own. This, however, brings up the question of what constitutes &quot;community,&quot;
    in a pluralistic society like our own&#150;rife with racial and ethnic tension. David
    Mamet addresses exactly this question in his haunting mystery <i>Homicide</i>.</p>
    <p>Bobby Gold is a good man and good cop, but he&#146;s finally undone because he
    can&#146;t figure out which tribe he belongs to. Like almost all of us in modern America,
    he has many tribes to choose from. Is he a peace officer constrained by the law of the
    State or a member of a close-knit group of homicide detectives linked by mutual loyalty or
    is he is Jew with duties to remember and a responsibility to repay the indecencies
    committed against Jews throughout Western history?</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the film, Gold clearly sees the homicide detectives as his true
    community, especially because of his close friendship with his Irish-American partner Tim
    Sullivan. But chance events start to intervene. On his way to the stakeout of a murder
    suspect, Gold stops to answer an &quot;officer in distress&quot; signal from a rookie
    officer. He solves the problem only to get &quot;caught&quot; with the case. It involves
    the murder of an elderly Jewish woman in a candy store in an African-American ghetto. Even
    though the woman&#146;s death seems clearly the result of an armed robbery gone wrong, the
    woman&#146;s family uses their political clout to insist that Gold handle the case. They
    want him because he&#146;s Jewish.</p>
    <p>He&#146;s reluctant, but slowly gets involved in the family&#146;s drama. It appears
    that they had been involved in gunrunning during the birth of the State of Israel and
    still may be involved in illegal activities fueled by Jewish nationalism. They taunt Gold
    about how he has turned his back on his heritage. One asks him tellingly, &quot;don&#146;t
    you belong anywhere?&quot;</p>
    <p>The question strikes home because Gold has discovered that no matter how good a cop he
    is, he&#146;ll always be a &quot;Jew&quot; down at the station house. Mamet rams this home
    when an altercation with an African-American superior results in Gold being on the
    receiving end of an antisemitic epithet. Even his success with his colleagues seems to
    stem from his reputation as a &quot;station house lawyer&quot; and &quot;hostage
    negotiator,&quot; qualities his friends link with his Jewishness. Twenty citations for
    valor can&#146;t free him from their stereotypical views. When he approaches his partner
    with his misgivings, even Sullivan impatiently tells him to stop all the &quot;Jew&quot;
    stuff and get back to work. Gold starts to think that maybe the Jews are the only
    community which will ever really accept him for himself.</p>
    <p>In order to win the Jewish group&#146;s respect, Gold personally takes part in the
    firebombing of the store of the publisher of anti-Semitic tracts. To his horror, Gold soon
    discovers that the group has induced him to commit a criminal act for the sole purpose of
    having evidence with which to blackmail him in the future. He suddenly realizes that they
    may be Jews, but they certainly are not friends. Worse yet, he realizes that the bombing
    has caused him to forget that he had promised Sullivan to help him at a showdown with the
    cop killer they were pursuing. He races to the scene only to discover that he&#146;s too
    late; Sullivan is down, mortally wounded. Gold discovers his search for acceptance as a
    Jew has resulted in facilitating his friend&#146;s death. Tellingly, Sullivan&#146;s last
    words to Gold are about all the great times they shared, with no mention of the missed
    date. At the end of the film, Gold is completely isolated, cut off from the Jewish
    activists and vulnerable to their blackmail, and boycotted by his colleagues at homicide
    who blame him for Sullivan&#146;s death.</p>
    <p>Richard Sherwin, in his excellent essay on the movie in my <i>Legal Reelism: Movies as
    Legal Texts</i> (U. Ill. Press 1997), accepts Mamet&#146;s own view that the movie has no
    &quot;moral.&quot; It&#146;s just a tale of the fates working out their caprices. But I
    think there is a moral, an important one for all of us who live in a multi-cultural
    society. Friendship is the personal face of community; and both are very fragile organisms
    which have to be continually nurtured to flower. Gold belonged to a community, at least
    two communities. First, he was a police detective with a duty to uphold, not to break that
    community&#146;s laws. He also was a member of a more close&#150;knit community with his
    colleagues on the homicide squad, especially Sullivan. This doesn&#146;t mean that his
    fellow officers could stop themselves from seeing him through the lens of ethnicity any
    more than he could see them as something other than Irish, Italian, or
    African&#150;American. It&#146;s always painful to be the victim of stereotype, but
    it&#146;s also inevitable in a mass society like America. Here at least the stereotypes
    were not hateful; his colleagues thought Gold was smart and a &quot;good talker,&quot; and
    he was. Gold&#146;s tragedy was to ignore this flawed but real community in favor of the
    fantasy of a mystical nationalism.</p>
    <p>When we see white and black citizens perceive completely different versions of the
    truth as in the O.J. Simpson case, or when police officers like Vanetter cavalierly ignore
    the Fourth Amendment, or when other police officers like Fuhrman engage in vicious racist
    rhetoric, we see how important it is that we realize that our constructed communities are
    not only fragile but irreplaceable. We see the alternative in places like Belfast and
    Sarajevo.</font><p>
