    <p><em><strong><font face="Verdana">by Mike Nevins, Saint Louis University School of Law </font></strong></em>(December
    1997)</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Only a small number of the countless Western feature films made
    since the dawn of talkies dealt centrally with legal themes, but one that left an enduring
    mark on other Western features and on Western TV series was <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Ox-Bow+Incident%2C+The+(1943)">THE OX-BOW INCIDENT</a>
    (20th Century-Fox, 1943), the anti-lynching classic directed by William Wellman and
    starring Henry Fonda. In the thirty years between OX-BOW and the more recent classic <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Dirty+Harry+(1971)">DIRTY HARRY</a> (1971; directed
    by Don Siegel and starring Clint Eastwood) it was an axiom in Westerns, questioned about
    as often as the existence of God is questioned within the four walls of a church, that due
    process of law is sacred; that taking the law into one's own hands via lynch mob or
    vigilante organization or by any other means was never justified no matter what the
    situation or provocation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One of the unique aspects of the television series MAVERICK
    (starring James Garner as Bret Maverick) was its delight in parodying other Western
    features and TV series, and perhaps its finest hour in this vein is <em>Bolt from the Blue</em>
    (November 27, 1960; written and directed by Robert Altman), in which the satiric target is
    OX-BOW itself. In this episode, Beauregard Maverick (Roger Moore) catches a sly old man
    named Eben Bolt (Tim Graham) trying to horsenap his mighty stallion Gumlegs but then
    they're both captured by a mob of ranchers and townsmen chasing Bolt and his elusive
    partner Benson January, who have &quot;dehorsed the countryside.&quot; Starky (Charles
    Fredericks) and the rest of the mob take Maverick to be January and are about to lynch
    both men on the spot when the party is interrupted by a bumptious youth (Will Hutchins)
    who never gives his name but can only be Tom Brewster from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?%22Sugarfoot%22+(1957)">SUGARFOOT</a>.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;Who's their counsel?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Starky: &quot;There ain't gonna be no counsel. We caught 'em,
      we're gonna hang 'em.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;Without a trial?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Starky: &quot;....They're horse thieves and that's trial enough
      for me.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;Now look, Starky, I am a lawyer and I know the law
      and the law says....&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Starky: &quot;We didn't come here to listen to no speeches, young
      man.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;They're entitled to a trial even if they're
      guilty.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Starky: &quot;Who says?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;The law of the land. You seem to forget I am a
      lawyer.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Starky: &quot;Nobody can forget you bein' a lawyer. You've been
      runnin' around town for months tryin' to stir up a case for yourself.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">When mob member Bradley (Percy Helton) begins to get queasy about
    lynching the prisoners, Starky decides to resolve the issue democratically.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Starky: &quot;All right, boys, looks like it goes to a vote. All
      in favor of hangin' say Aye.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Everyone in the mob except Bradley: &quot;Aye!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Starky: &quot;All in favor of a trial....&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Maverick and Bolt (at the top of their lungs): &quot;AYE!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;The second bunch of ayes have it.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But before the circuit judge can be sent for there has to be a
    conference between attorney and client.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Maverick: &quot;....Just convince them they've got the wrong man,
      will you?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer (hands over ears): &quot;Tuttuttuttuttut! It isn't ethical
      for me to listen to evidence until I'm hired.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Maverick: &quot;Oh. All right, well, you're hired.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;That'll be one hundred dollars in advance and
      another hundred if I get you off.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Bolt (who earlier had noticed that Maverick was carrying a roll of
      bills): &quot;It's a deal! The money's in the saddlebag.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;I'm only going to take a hundred, Mr. January. If
      you don't hang I'll trust you for the rest.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Bolt: &quot;Mr. Lawyer, I ain't trying to tell you how to run your
      case, but if you want to win this one for sure, just cut these ropes and let us git!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;You'll get a proper trial, old man. You too, Mr.
      January.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Maverick: &quot;I'm not January!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;Mr. January, let me decide the proper line of
      defense. I'm the lawyer.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">After the defender of legality has ridden off to find the circuit
    judge, Maverick takes aside the youngest member of the lynch mob (Arnold Merritt).</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Maverick: &quot;Hey, Junior. That lawyer. Is he any good?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;Hasn't lost a case yet.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Bolt: &quot;That's encouragin'.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Junior: &quot;Hasn't had a case yet. You'll be the first.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But when we get to meet Judge Hookstratten (Richard Hale), who's
    just finishing up another trial in town, we wonder whether Maverick might not do better
    without him. &quot;It is the duty of the law to protect as well as to prosecute. It's our
    function to work for the accused, look after his interests as well as convict him. Now
    with these values firmly in mind, I now pronounce the defendant---GUILTY! HANG HIM!&quot;
    The young lawyer rides into town soon after Hookstratten has left but in time to meet
    Angelica Garland (Fay Spain), who has just gotten off the stagecoach and has been hunting
    for the man who had left her waiting at the altar in St. Louis---Benson January. The two
    catch up with Hookstratten on the trail.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;Your Honor, I am a lawyer and there is a trial you
      are needed for....&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Hookstratten: &quot;What kind?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;Horse stealing.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Hookstratten (smacking his lips): &quot;That's a <em>hanging</em>
      crime!&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">They arrive just in time to stop the impatient lynch mob from
    hanging Maverick and Bolt and Altman's version of a &quot;proper trial&quot; gets
    underway, with no one sworn in, no one cross-examined, and Angelica not only identifying
    Maverick as Benson January but trying to shoot him where he stands. The mob serves as jury
    and deliberates for roughly a nanosecond.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Starky (as jury foreman): &quot;Your Honor, we figger we made a
      mistake about that nice old fella. But January, he's guilty as sin.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Hookstratten: &quot;You're acquitted, old man. January, you're
      sentenced to hang. That'll be twenty-five dollars.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Bolt, &quot;out of gratitude and due respect for the law,&quot;
    pays the judge's fee out of Maverick's bankroll and, preparing to ride off, happens to
    mention that it's Sunday.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Maverick: &quot;Sunday! It's Sunday? Why, you can't hang a man on
      Sunday!&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Starky: &quot;You just watch us.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Lawyer: &quot;He's right....According to law you can't hang a man
      on Sunday.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Hookstratten (who hanged his last defendant a few hours ago):
      &quot;By golly, Counselor is right! You have to wait till after midnight....That's the
      law, you've got to wait till then. Not a minute before.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Starky: &quot;All right, tie him up, boys, and break out the
      bottles.&quot; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">We are still only about halfway through the film, and Altman
    continues to pile twist upon comic twist and character upon bizarre character much as he
    would do on the big screen a decade later in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?MASH+(1970)">M*A*S*H</a> (1970), leaving us with
    perhaps the only TV Western episode that uses legal themes as the basis for anarchic
    farce.</font></p>
