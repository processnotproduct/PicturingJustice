    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana">Amistad (Van Buren's Folly)</font></h1>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana"><em>By Robert L. Waring </em>(December 1997)</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Yes, it&#146;s true that <i>Amistad</i> is another movie about
    some black people in peril who are helped out by some nice white guys, and told largely
    from the perspective of these white guys. For that reason, this true story of the 1839
    rebellion on the slave ship La Amistad and the subsequent recapture and trial of the
    (alleged) slaves has been the subject of some controversy. Director Steven Spielberg
    attempted to deflect some of this criticism in a recent interview by explaining that the
    film is not so much a tale about slavery as it is about &quot;how these Africans are
    hopelessly caught in the quagmire of the American justice system.&quot; (His comment may
    also have been introspective&#151;<i>Amistad</i> has been mired in a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/amistad/">legal challenge</a> by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/amistad/bcr.html">Barbara Chase-Riboud</a>, an author who
    alleged the film appropriated her ideas. She filed an unsuccessful, last minute injunction
    to prevent its release, heightening the film&#146;s public visibility and further lining
    Spielberg&#146;s pockets and possibly her own.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Taking a cue from Spielberg, this commentary discusses the
    film&#146;s depiction of the two issues of slavery and justice. While I disagree with
    Spielberg&#151;slavery is the more important issue of the two&#151;<i>Amistad</i> teaches
    an important lesson about judicial independence.</font></p>
    <font size="4"><p><strong><small><font face="Verdana">Slavery</font></small></strong></font><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Regardless of one&#146;s opinion of Spielberg&#146;s perspective
    in depicting slavery, it must be acknowledged that the film tells a powerful story about
    that evil institution. Yes, there are some scenes overly engineered with loud music and
    Spielberg&#146;s syrupy sentimentality, but the film becomes an inescapable vortex at its
    midpoint when the principle spokesman for the slaves, Cinque, recounts the horrors of his
    kidnaping and voyage to Cuba on a slave ship. This flashback is as difficult to watch as
    any scene from Spielberg&#146;s <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Schindler%27s+List+(1993)"><i>Schindler&#146;s List</i></a>.
    The film does have a happy ending, but fortunately, that does not begin to make up for the
    revulsion most viewers are likely to retain from their terrifying glimpse of slave
    transport.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One nearly universal reaction to this film is bewilderment about
    how such a compelling story could have remained untold for so long. In fact, a novel
    called <i>Black Mutiny</i> based on the story was published in 1953. Perhaps in part
    because America has been in a state of self-denial about slavery since the founding of the
    Republic, the La Amistad incident, a national embarrassment, never seems to have achieved
    prominence in any history book. That should change as a result of Spielberg&#146;s noble
    effort.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">What is more surprising is that the story has also remained
    invisible in the home nation of the slaves, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/amistad/bcr.html">Sierra Leone</a>. I heard an interview
    on National Public Radio a week before the release of <i>Amistad</i> in which a playwright
    from Sierra Leone told how he first learned of the rebellion from a white teacher in 1986.
    His recent play about La Amistad made his nation aware of this lost piece of history and
    will open in America in mid-1998. Incidently, in the film, Spielberg wisely chose to cast
    actors from Sierra Leone in the slave roles, thereby enhancing the film&#146;s portrayal
    of the culture shock the slaves experienced.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">It would be wonderful if <i>Amistad </i>sparked millions of
    meaningful conversations between black, brown and white people about race. Unfortunately,
    in part because some prominent African-Americans seem troubled about the white origins of
    the film, this may not happen. That lost opportunity would be tragic indeed. The OJ
    Simpson case and the dismantling of affirmative action appear to have further polarized
    points of view on the significance of race in our society. Many whites (and a few blacks)
    bitterly resent so-called &quot;playing the race card&quot; in the courtroom, at school or
    on the job. Yet, what is on that card is still very different for African-American and
    white people. This lack of understanding about <i>what</i> is being &quot;played&quot;
    distorts the process and leads to further resentment on both sides. Any white person who
    after watching <i>Amistad</i> still believes that the time has come to forget the sins of
    the past and move on should watch the film again with an African-American and discuss it
    afterwards.</font></p>
    <font size="4"><p><strong><small><font face="Verdana">Justice</font></small></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film achieves some notoriety through its addition to the
    lexicon of lawyer names of yet another insult: &quot;dung scraper.&quot; The abolitionists
    who take up the cause of the rebellious slaves are approached by an ambitious young
    lawyer, Roger Baldwin, played convincingly by Matthew McConaughey and described by one
    reviewer as a mutton-chopped &quot;antebellum ambulance chaser.&quot; The Africans, who
    don&#146;t speak a word of English, decide that the Baldwin, whose function is a mystery
    to them, reminds them of a dung scraper from back home. (Those viewers who saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Jurassic+Park+(1993)"><i>Jurassic Park</i></a> may
    remember that Spielberg has a certain disdain for the profession, as evidenced by the
    dining habits of his reptiles.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The young lawyer, much to the horror of the moralistic
    abolitionists, analyzes the case in an unemotional, lawyer-like fashion, likening it to a
    simple property dispute. Yet, from the outset, the posture of the case is cloudy. The
    legal process begins with what must be every judge&#146;s basic nightmare. In a cramped,
    overcrowded federal district courtroom in Connecticut, a succession lawyers appears, each
    holding up writs and pleas and insisting on being heard, until there are five parties
    present, each claiming to have international treaties on their side.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The two surviving crew members and the Spanish government, under
    whose authority La Amistad sailed, each demand the return of the vessel and its human
    cargo. The United States supports the Spanish, but argues the slaves should be executed as
    murderous mutineers, giving a criminal flavor to the admiralty proceedings. The crew of
    the United States warship that recaptured La Amistad claims a one-third <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/amistad/salvage.html">salvage interest in the vessel,
    under a maritime law incentive scheme</a> that rewards enterprising seamen, even those in
    government employ, for retrieving lost property. (Mercifully, Spielberg chose to leave out
    the similar claims of some opportunistic Long Island residents.) British Naval officers
    appear as self-righteous witnesses who also ply international waters intercepting slave
    ships and freeing their prisoners. The movie begins to look like <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?%22Roots%22+(1977)+(mini)"><i>Roots</i></a> meets <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Citizen+Ruth+(1996)"><i>Citizen Ruth</i></a>, as
    these competing parties dogmatically pursue their causes, mostly oblivious to the welfare
    of the Africans whose lives and liberty are at stake.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Nevertheless, as Baldwin predicted, the resolution of the dispute
    boils down to one simple issue. Under international treaties in force for two decades,
    importation of African slaves to the Americas is illegal. Spain and the United States
    contend that the slaves in question were born in Cuba. The abolitionists claim that they
    were illegally imported, and thus the Africans are not slaves and their homicidal
    rebellion was justified by the law of necessity. Much of the story is devoted to
    Baldwin&#146;s gathering of evidence that establishes the origins of the Africans, whose
    principle function at his point in the story seems to be their curiosity value for the
    Connecticut townsfolk who gawk as every day they trudge from jail to court in chains.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But there is a powerful twist to this otherwise simple case.
    United States President Martin Van Buren is running for re-election and is anxious to
    secure the electoral votes of southern states very nervous about giving any encouragement
    to slave rebellions. Throughout the Africans&#146; legal journey, Van Buren and his
    advisors work behind the scenes to rig the courts against them and the story at times
    seems primarily focused on this interference by the executive branch into the activities
    of judiciary.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The first tactic, thankfully unsuccessful, involves forcing a
    retrial before a young judge recently appointed by Van Buren. The film skips the
    Africans&#146; pro forma victory at the court of appeals, and instead focuses on the
    pressure the executive branch places on the Supreme Court. (A detail glossed over by the
    film is that the Supreme Court did not issue its ruling until after Van Buren had already
    lost the election.) One particularly interesting scene is a state dinner and a
    conversation between the Spanish Ambassador and President Van Buren. The Ambassador,
    puzzled over the unfavorable ruling by the district court, asks, &quot;If you cannot rule
    the courts, how can you rule?&quot; Van Buren hypocritically replies, &quot;Our people
    believe it is the independence of the courts that ensures their freedom.&quot; Those who
    in present times question the notion of life tenure for judges might find this exchange of
    interest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In a monologue which immediately follows, former Vice-President
    Calhoun threatens armed rebellion by the southern states over the slavery issue.
    Undoubtedly, the screen writers were trying to illustrate the pressures facing Van Buren
    and the nation in 1840, but having Calhoun commit treason at a state dinner seems a little
    over the top.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Of special note is Anthony Hopkins&#146; portrayal of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/amistad/adamsbio.html">John Quincy Adams</a>. When we
    first see former President Adams, he is a man well into his declining years. The film only
    hints at the fact that Adams was a one-term President, elected without an electoral
    college mandate and elevated to that high office as a result of fragile coalition in the
    Congress. Also an acclaimed former secretary of state, his idealistic goals as President
    were frustrated by factionalism. In the decade following his re-election defeat in 1828,
    he became a major force in the opposition to slavery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">As depicted in <i>Amistad</i>, the abolitionists repeatedly plead
    with Adams to help them with the case, which they know is being subjected to heavy
    political pressure. He refuses, appearing to have no stomach for the fight. But he gives
    Baldwin one key suggestion regarding trial advocacy: learn the human story of your clients
    and emotionally relate that to the court. As a result of this advice, the audience and the
    court learn of the inhumanity of slave trading and the movie and court case succeed.
    Beginning trial lawyers should take note.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Baldwin eventually prevails upon Adams to join their fight when
    they reach the Supreme Court. Although the movie does not indicate this, Adams reportedly
    argued before the Supreme Court for eight and half hours on behalf of his clients.
    Presumably, this was prior to the days of oral argument time limits and the establishment
    of decent theaters in Washington. Adams must have been a good orator, but sadly, the text
    of his remarks was not included in the official report of the case because he failed to
    submit it. The reporter does note that much of what Adams said was not considered by the
    court in the opinion, authored by Justice Joseph Story, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/amistad/supct.html">40 U.S. 518, 566 (1841)</a>. It may
    be safe to assume that Adams spent considerable time putting a human face on the dispute.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Ironically, <a href="http://www2.law.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/foliocgi.exe/justices/query=*/doc/{t62}?">Justice
    Story</a> (portrayed in the film in a cameo by retired Justice Harry Blackmun in his first
    screen role) held the seat on the Court that had first been offered to Adams some thirty
    years before. Adams had declined, presumably in favor of his presidential aspirations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Two curiosities of note: Spielberg chose not to tell the story of
    a legal slave named Antonio who was onboard La Amistad. By order of the district court he
    was returned to his owner in Cuba, presumably because it was established that he was born
    in the Americas. The film also glossed over the final resolution of the case. The district
    court holding had directed the President to transport the Africans back to Africa at
    government expense based on the government&#146;s own argument that the Africans had
    illegally brought a slave ship into U.S. waters. In its appeal, the government dropped
    this argument, which the Supreme Court noted was absurd. (Persons involuntarily forced
    into slavery cannot themselves be guilty of slave trading.) So the Supreme Court followed
    the circuit court holding and merely declared the Africans to be free persons. With no
    help from the government, it took a year for Abolitionist groups to arrange for their
    return to Sierra Leone. But these facts might have diluted the otherwise happy ending.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">We can also thank Spielberg for an idea to increase public
    interest in the normally undramatic proceedings of the Supreme Court. Why not have
    criminal defendants in the courtroom in chains when the Supreme Court announces rulings? A
    marshal could then either release them on the spot, or, in the case of capital offenses,
    escort them to a nearby death chamber. The public would love it.</font></p>
