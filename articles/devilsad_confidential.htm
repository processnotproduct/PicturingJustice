    <p><font face="Verdana">This section reveals more about the film <i>Devil&#146;s Advocate</i>
    than someone who has not seen it would want to know. If you read on, it will spoil some of
    the film&#146;s surprises.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Wasn&#146;t the film a perverse spin on the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Star+Wars+(1977)"><i>Star Wars</i></a> trilogy
    plot? Son discovers evil man is actually his father and that a beautiful woman in his life
    is actually his sister. The twist here is that dad wants the son to have sex with the
    sister while he watches. Darth Vader was never that evil, but then, he wasn&#146;t a
    lawyer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">This film is certain to inspire more lawyer jokes. Example: What
    is the real reason many Americans are reluctant to support gun control? Answer: Fewer
    lawyers would commit suicide.</font></p>
