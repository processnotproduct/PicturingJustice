    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana">A Free Soul&#151;<em>Drunk Lawyers
    in the Movies</em></font></h1>
    <p><strong><em><font face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow, UCLA Law School </font></em></strong>(June
    1998)</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The first of the great alcoholic film lawyers was Steven Ash in <i>A
    Free Soul</i> (1931), for which Lionel Barrymore received an Oscar. The picture also
    features Norma Shearer, Clark Gable, and Leslie Howard. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Ash was based on the character of Earl Rogers, who was as famous
    and notorious in California in the early years of the century as Melvin Belli or Johnny
    Cochran. Rogers was the lawyer you had to get if you were in trouble&#151;and could afford
    him. Rogers represented Clarence Darrow in Darrow&#146;s jury tampering trial in 1912.
    Rogers was a hopeless alcoholic whose career ultimately collapsed because of his illness.
    He died broke and alone.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In his fine book about the Darrow trial, <i>The People v. Clarence
    Darrow</i> (Times Books 1993), Geoff Cowan writes about Rogers:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana">In the winter of 1911-12, Earl Rogers was at the height of his
        powers, already a criminal lawyer of national note, well on his way to becoming the
        legendary creator of courtroom antics, tactics, and drama that novelists would try to
        capture and criminal lawyers would try to imitate. His reputation had already begun to
        emerge as the larger-than-life prototype of a defense counsel whose matinee idol following
        is only enhanced by his remarkable combination of wit, charm, intemperance, and
        deviousness, and his wide range of friendships with journalists, detectives, barkeepers,
        and prostitutes. Earl Rogers was a comet on the horizon of criminal law, a blazing figure
        whose brief but remarkable career left an image that still remains. (Id. at 283-84). </font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Rogers&#146; life, and his terrible struggle with alcoholism, were
    chronicled in a biography called <i>Final Verdict</i> (Doubleday, 1962) written by his
    daughter Adela Rogers St. Johns who became a successful novelist and journalist. It seems
    Adela never went to school much, mostly hanging out at her dad&#146;s law office and
    attending his famous trials. The book was made into an unsuccessful film, also called <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Final+Verdict+(1991)+(TV)"><i>Final Verdict</i></a> (1991),
    which focuses on several of Rogers&#146; early and most famous trials. Treat Williams
    plays Rogers in this film. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><i>A Free Soul</i> was based on a novel written by Adela.
    It&#146;s a fictionalized account of her father&#146;s life&#151;and her own. In the film,
    Adela is Jan Ash&#151;the free soul of the title who flaunts the stodgy conventions of
    upper class San Francisco. Steven Ash represents Ace Wilfong (Gable), a roguish gambler in
    a murder case. The key evidence against Wilfong is his hat which was found at the crime
    scene. Through dishonest means, Ash substitutes a much smaller hat for the one previously
    introduced in evidence&#151;and then Wilfong is acquitted when the phony hat doesn&#146;t
    fit. Does this sound familiar to anyone?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Later Jan takes up with Ace, over Steven&#146;s objection and,
    gasp, spends the night with him. When she refuses to marry Ace, he threatens to spread the
    gossip all over San Francisco. Jan&#146;s loving friend Dwight Winthrop (Howard), whom she
    has spurned as too dull, kills Wilfong to preserve Jan&#146;s honor. Meanwhile, Steven has
    drunk his way into the gutter. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Things seem hopeless in Winthrop&#146;s murder trial, but Jan
    finds Steven passed out in a cheap saloon and drags him into the courtroom. Steven is
    almost too weak and dissipated to speak, but he takes over the case and delivers an
    impassioned closing argument. Then he falls dead on the courtroom floor. Very
    melodramatic&#151;and very effective. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Substance abuse among lawyers is a terrible problem. Studies
    indicate that the alcoholism rate among lawyers may be twice that of the general
    population&#151;perhaps 20% of the total number of lawyers. It is unknown whether this
    high incidence rate results from the extreme stress of practicing law, or because the same
    personality traits predispose one to law practice and substance abuse. Nobody knows the
    extent of cocaine abuse among lawyers, but it too is undoubtedly substantial and
    devastating. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Substance abuse inevitably results in impaired performance&#151;at
    least poor judgment, incompetence and neglect of client affairs, sometimes fraud and theft
    from clients. Fifty to seventy percent of the disciplinary cases brought before state bar
    ethics panels result at least in part from alcohol or drug abuse. A great many malpractice
    cases also have their roots in substance abuse. There are now substantial resources
    available to help lawyers in trouble with substance abuse, such as The Other Bar, a Twelve
    Step program intended for lawyers, and state bar diversion programs. Nevertheless, the
    problem is very serious and appears to be getting worse. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Recent films have done a good job of showing lawyers drastically
    impaired by alcohol abuse. Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) in <a href="Verdict.htm"><i>The
    Verdict</i></a> comes to mind immediately; he&#146;s a hopeless drunk who ignores his
    cases and solicits business by showing up at the funerals of strangers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Lucian Wilbanks (Donald Sutherland) has been disbarred for
    alcoholism in <a href="TimetoKillAdamsRib.htm"><i>A Time to Kill</i></a>. In one powerful
    scene, Wilbanks wanders his estate sipping from the bottle as he advises Jake Brigance on
    tactics in the upcoming trial of Carl Lee Hailey. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Sleepers+(1996)"><i>Sleepers</i></a>,
    Benny Snyder (Dustin Hoffman) barely manages to walk around. He also has &quot;a small
    drug problem.&quot; His ineptitude is the reason he&#146;s recruited as a defense lawyer
    in the DA&#146;s scheme to throw the case. If Snyder doesn&#146;t follow orders, he&#146;s
    told by the neighborhood crime boss, he can look forward to a &quot;dirtnap.&quot;
    I&#146;d welcome readers&#146; suggestions about additional films showing lawyers with
    drinking or drug problems.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Numerous lawyers are shown drinking during the work day, as in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?...And+Justice+for+All+(1979)"><i>And Justice for All</i></a>
    and <a href="BodyHeat.htm"><i>Body Heat</i></a>. This has to affect their performance the
    rest of the day and may well be a precursor to much more severe alcoholism problems down
    the road&#151;like those that destroyed the brilliant careers of Steven Ash in <i>A Free
    Soul</i> and his real-life model, Earl Rogers.</font></p>
