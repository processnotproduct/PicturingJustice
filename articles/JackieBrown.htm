    <p><font face="Verdana"><strong><em>by <a href="http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~judithg/"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Judith Grant, University of Southern California</strong></font></a></em><small>
    </small>(December 1997)<strong><small><br>
    <br>
    </small></strong>Quentin Tarantino&#146;s films tend to be a little over the top on the
    masculinity scale. Both <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Reservoir+Dogs+(1992)"><em>Reservoir
    Dogs</em></a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Pulp+Fiction+(1994)"><em>Pulp
    Fiction</em></a> can be read as elaborate morality plays about masculinity and
    honor.&nbsp; The main characters in the brilliant and bloody <em><font face="Verdana">Reservoir
    Dogs</font></em>, for instance, are all enmeshed in the problems of loyalty and
    honor.&nbsp; Harvey Keitel, following a thief&#146;s honor, is true to the wrong man (Mr.
    Orange) who turns out to be an undercover cop (and thus, beholden to another kind of
    honor).&nbsp; Mr. Orange, in turn, is not betrayed by his law enforcement brother who
    refuses to blow his cover even when he is tortured by the sadistic Mr. White.<p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><em>Pulp Fiction</em>, in turn, can literally be seen as a series
    of vignettes about men and loyalty.&nbsp; The most striking example is the story involving
    Bruce Willis.&nbsp; Recall that after making a narrow escape, he returns to an
    unimaginably weird scene involving man-on-man sexual violence.&nbsp; It evokes the film <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Deliverance+(1972)"><em>Deliverance</em></a> which
    is, not incidentally, another story about male honor.&nbsp; Willis&#146; character goes
    back to save his arch enemy from rape even though he has every reason to believe that
    doing so will get him killed.&nbsp; But saving another&#146;s masculinity is simply the
    right thing for him to do.&nbsp; He is, after all, following in the footsteps of DeNiro
    and Brando in portraying that great cinematic symbol of the honorable male: a boxer.<br>
    <br>
    The fact that men have been so important to Tarantino is what makes his latest film,
    Jackie Brown, so surprising.&nbsp; The film is still about men and their relationships to
    each other as they are mediated through women (in that, it is very like <em>Pulp Fiction</em>).
    &nbsp; But more than Tarantino&#146;s other films, this one attempts to feature a female
    viewpoint.&nbsp; In truth, most of the women in the film are fairly average Hollywood film
    women. There is a bitchy, &#147;skanky,&#148; stoned-out young blond; a backwoods young
    woman who seems almost mentally retarded, and a big Sophie Tucker type cast as a simple
    good-time mama. These less developed characters do not particularly transcend Hollywood
    stereotypes.&nbsp; But, in many ways, the main character does move beyond them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Jackie Brown, is played with astonishing depth by the voluptuous
    veteran of Blacksploitation films, Pam Grier.&nbsp; And Grier&#146;s Jackie Brown is
    cool.&nbsp; She is smart enough to outwit the cold-blooded villain played by Sam
    Jackson.&nbsp; And though she is alone, it is implied that she is not lonely for male
    companionship.&nbsp; The hard knocks she has taken on the street have not made her bitter
    or ugly.&nbsp; When she enlists the help of the love-sick bail agent in an illegal scheme
    against both the cops and the bad guys, she does not become selfish or shrewish as other
    film-noir heroines have ( think of Barbara Stanwick in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Double+Indemnity+(1944)"><em>Double Indemnity</em></a>,
    for example).&nbsp; Instead, Tarantino&#146;s Brown is more like a prototypical male hero
    who is allowed a complexity of character sufficient to allow good and bad to co-exist
    without fear of cinematic retribution.&nbsp; In short, Brown does not die at the end of
    the film.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Brown is a survivor with the kind of street savvy that allows her
    to see her one chance to save her life while escaping the kind of poverty for which she is
    destined as a middle-aged, single black woman with few salable skills. &nbsp; The film
    opens and closes with a long shot of her alone and moving symbolizing the extent to which
    this is Brown&#146;s story, alone.&nbsp; Like the 1996 film, <a href="set_it_off.htm"><em>Set
    It Off</em></a>, Jackie Brown explores the terrain of Black women who are basically good
    people but who turn to crime with mixed results. Yes, she does come to enjoy the spoils of
    conquest, but without love or friendship.&nbsp; The message is ultimately that, like male
    heroes, she prevails in some sense because she is alone.</font></p>
