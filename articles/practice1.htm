    <p></b><strong><em>John Denvir, University of San Francisco School of Law </em>(November
    1998)</strong><p>
    <p></font><strong><font face="Courier New"><big><big><big> </big></big></big></font></strong><font face="Verdana">David Kelley&#146;s <em>The Practice</em> has opened its second season.
    Starting as a dark horse entry late on Saturday night, the show finished up by winning
    several Emmys and laying serious claim to be the true successor to television
    &quot;lawyer&quot; classic series like LA Law and The Defenders. It seems a good time to
    ask what kind of magic Kelley is working.<p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The opening episode has all the key elements of <em>The Practice&#146;s</em>
    basic strategy. One part is a sort of legal Ripley&#146;s &quot;<em>Believe It or Not</em>&quot;.
    The American legal system does a pretty fair job when both sides are represented by
    competent lawyers, but there are always those blind spots where legal logic leads to
    absurd results. This episode&#146;s example centers on two young men who are both accused
    of killing a teenage girl. Each tells exactly the same story: the other defendant did it.
    Since they are the only two witnesses, how can a jury find either guilty &quot;beyond a
    reasonable doubt?&quot; Kelley has a talent for setting up this &quot;believe or not&quot;
    scenario, but it&#146;s difficult to sustain show after show, year after year. I
    don&#146;t think this is the Kelley &quot;secret.&quot;<img src="images/bobby1.jpg" alt="bobby1.jpg (6706 bytes)" align="left" width="180" height="363" hspace="20" vspace="20"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second ingredient is ambivalence towards the ethical quality of legal
    practice. This episode revolves around the guilt which Ellenor feels when she realizes
    that she has unknowingly employed one of her lawyer &quot;tricks&quot; to the detriment of
    her friend and colleague Bobby Donal. She is so disgusted by her own &quot;win at any
    cost&quot; tactics that she indulges herself in a monologue about how lawyers manipulate
    the system to free guilty defendants so they can return to the streets to rob, rape, and
    pillage once again. This sort of &quot;lawyer angst&quot; is another staple of the Kelley
    &quot;touch.&quot; Ellenor is usually upset about getting creeps &quot;off.&quot; Eugene
    is angry that innocent poor people are often convicted, and Lindsey is always worrying
    about her Harvard Law education being used to free drug traffickers. Once again, this
    angle is a difficult one to prolong show after show, year after year. The viewer knows
    that the adversary system has its flaws. Sometimes the guilty are freed or the innocent
    convicted, but nobody, certainly not Kelley, is seriously suggesting alternatives. In this
    episode, Ellenor is so upset that she asks Bobby for a leave from the firm. He refuses her
    the leave, but perhaps it would be a good idea for the series as a whole. Ellenor as a
    (sic) barmaid in the local legal watering hole might make an interesting plot development.
    She could then taunt her former colleagues with a clean conscience.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that the essence of Kelley&#146;s magic is not weird plots or
    lawyer guilt; it&#146;s his ability to play on the American fascination with issues of
    class. This is especially interesting since ideologically Americans don&#146;t believe in
    &quot;class&quot; which we prefer to see as a European vice. Still the fact is that the
    Kennedys and Rockefellers are not like you and me. In the episode under discussion,
    Ellenor&#146;s disenchantment with law is contrasted with the joy experienced by office
    manager Rebecca upon receipt of the news that she has passed the Bar exam after five years
    of study at night law school. We see a similar burst of parvenu pride when Bobby Donal
    shows his father the firm&#146;s new conference room. All Bobby&#146;s colleagues knew
    that Bobby&#146;s dad worked for a big corporate firm; what they didn&#146;t know was that
    he was a janitor. <img src="images/rebecca2.jpg" alt="rebecca2.jpg (5135 bytes)" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="138" height="150"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The discovery of Bobby&#146;s social origins informs us that all of the
    &quot;regulars&quot;, except Lindsey, appear to come from working class backgrounds.
    Usually its Jimmy is assigned the role of he socially ascendant immigrant who has finally
    achieved the American dream. Now it appears that Rebecca will join him in this role. Here
    Kelley is showing us an important fact about American life; whatever the moral quality of
    the practice of law, sociologically it denotes entry into American middle class. Eugene
    and Ellenor are one stage beyond Jimmy and Rebecca on the class escalator; they realize
    that the price of social mobility may well be moral ambiguity. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the two most interesting characters, Bobby and Lindsey, even
    more tellingly highlight the American uneasiness about class. Lindsey is a blue blood who
    might have wandered in off the &quot;<em>Ally McBeal</em>&quot; set. She was Harvard Law <img src="images/bobby3.jpg" alt="bobby3.jpg (5926 bytes)" align="left" width="180" height="374" hspace="20" vspace="20">and destined for a big corporate firm;
    yet she is fascinated with Donal&#146;s &quot;street practice&quot; just as she attempts
    to bring the firm a more &quot;respectable&quot; image. Donal on his side is the
    &quot;outlaw&quot; who disdains the big corporate lawyers who dishonored his Dad, but
    whose respect he still craves. You might say that Bobby is the poor kid hanging around
    outside the country club while Lindsey is the debutante who likes boys who ride
    motorcycles. Most Americans can identify with one or the other, or both. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The central metaphor in the episode then becomes the conference room which
    Lindsey has convinced Bobby the firm needs for its expanding practice. Kelley shows us the
    room; it&#146;s not much, the combination of institutional modern and fake antique that
    you&#146;ll find in any moderately successful PI defense firm in a middle-sized American
    city. But to Lindsey it represents the hope that she can have it both ways: the
    &quot;charge&quot; of Bobby&#146;s practice with the social prestige of the corporate law
    firm. Bobby is smarter than Lindsey on this issue; he knows he can&#146;t have it both
    ways. If he becomes a &quot;respected member of the Bar&quot; he loses the
    &quot;outlaw&quot; status he (and Lindsey) both value so highly. Still he finally succumbs
    to the conference room. Why? It makes his pop so proud.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelley&#146;s treatment of class has good bloodlines, going back at
    least as far as Frank Capra&#146;s <em>It happened One Night</em> where street smart Clark
    Gable matches wits with the elegant, but needy Claudette Colbert. On one level, the
    Capra&#146;s movie was a romantic comedy, but on a deeper level it was a depression era
    fable about how class antagonism could be refined into New Deal liberalism. So too, Kelley
    is showing us a struggle most privileged Americans fight internally: the class war between
    the James Dean and the Grace Kelly which lurks within each of us. He seems to know an
    important secret about Americans--Class--we can&#146;t live with it or without it.</font><p>
