    <font face="Verdana"><b><p></b>The recent spate of movies involving rogue cops (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Cop+Land+(1997)"><i>Cop Land</i></a>, for example) and
    starring gangsta rappers (Ice Cube and Tupak Shakur, for example) has left me <img src="images/tupac1.jpg" alt="wpe1.jpg (4764 bytes)" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="15" width="189" height="198">rather cold, but at the same time
    questioning a conclusion I reached when gangsta rap first emerged. How despicable, I had
    thought, to glorify through song (or what passes for song these days) the act of killing
    those who seek to enforce the law. The movies, however, cast the harshness of gangsta rap
    in a different light for me. Killing cops for the fun of it remains a loathsome goal, and
    glorifying cop killing also has no place in an orderly society. However, how should we
    react when corrupt cops threaten not only our persons but our orderly society itself?
    This, it would appear, emerges as the message from the combination of any number of
    &quot;bad cop&quot; movies and gangsta rap. We should not, however, overlook the
    inescapable fact that society has wrestled with this question for as many years as the
    metaphor of &quot;new wine into old bottles&quot; has been trite.<p>
    <p>One of my students introduced me to a lovely, dynamic CD by Loreena McKennitt entitled
    &quot;<a href="http://www.quinlanroad.com/">The Book of Secrets</a>,&quot; which contains
    her song version of Noyes&#146; old<img src="images/mckennitt.gif" alt="mckennitt.gif (18919 bytes)" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="129" height="130"> chestnut, &quot;The Highwayman.&quot; (My friend and colleague, Paul Joseph,
    also mentioned <a href="http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~trent/ochs/i-aint.html">Phil Ochs</a>&#146;
    version of Noyes&#146; poem.) As you might recall, that paragon of English criminality,
    the Highwayman, ultimately met his death, shot &quot;down like a dog on the highway&quot;
    by the king&#146;s soldiers who bore the charge of keeping the peace on the king&#146;s
    highway. Let&#146;s not forget that highwaymen made their living by robbing (and
    occasionally killing) travelers on the highway at gunpoint, swordpoint, and knifepoint.
    However, we feel great sympathy for Noyes&#146; Highwayman in some part because he <img src="images/phil1.gif" width="223" height="245" alt="phil1.gif (21269 bytes)" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="15">met his death because
    he loved too well. In larger part, we feel sympathy because the soldiers themselves have
    proved thoroughly repulsive. Seizing the Highwayman&#146;s lover (Bess, the
    landlord&#146;s daughter), &quot;They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering
    jest;/ They had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!/ &#145;Now
    keep good watch!&#146; and they kissed her.&quot; These coarse, unworthy, but duly
    authorized representatives of King Charles disgust us &#150; we cheer for the Highwayman
    and want him to escape their vile clutches. Yet our hopes meet the same fate as Bess and
    the Highwayman. As the Highwayman approaches the inn, Bess manages to touch the trigger of
    the musket and kills herself to warn him of the trap. He runs from the inn, but on
    discovering her death, returns for revenge and meets his own fate instead.</p>
    <p>Noyes forms only one link in a lengthy chain of poems, ballads, and folk tales
    condemning corrupt authority and praising outlaws. Need we mention Robin Hood? Martha
    Duncan, in the conclusion to her remarkable study, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0814718809/qid=910205224/sr=1-2/002-0133813-0870828"><i>Romantic
    Outlaws, Beloved Prisons</i></a>, states that we &quot;use criminals and prisons to exalt
    our lives, to comfort ourselves in the face of our finitude, to defend against
    despair.&quot; Other scholars have suggested that ballads form an integral part of the
    voice of rebellion against oppressive and brutal authority. Those condemned to life in the
    ghetto, those who must show their hotel keys to authorities because they fit a
    &quot;profile&quot; of a prostitute, those who cannot drive the highway without law
    enforcement officers stopping them simply because of the color of their skin &#150; all
    know the negative face of the law. When faced with corrupt cops, cops who oppress rather
    than protect, cultures throughout history have naturally reacted by supporting the rebel. </p>
    <p>Tupak Shakur and other gangsta rappers give the public the obverse side of the
    &quot;romantic outlaw&quot; coin &#150; the direct opposition to authority. This does not
    suggest that the obverse side has the same appeal &#150; dumping tea into Boston Harbor
    differs significantly in both moral quality and rebellious quantity from setting off car
    bombs near English military posts in Belfast. On the other hand, it does suggest that we
    view gangsta rap CD&#146;s and rogue cop movies as a contemporary manifestation of a long
    cultural tradition.</font><p>
