    But</em></font></h1>
    <font face="Verdana"><p><em><strong>By Michael Asimow, UCLA Law School</strong> and </em><b><i>Stan
    Ross, University of New South Wales School of Law</i></b><em> </em>(September 1998)</p>
    <p>The new film <i>Return to Paradise</i> raises profound questions about the gulf between
    law and justice and about personal moral responsibility. We think every lawyer should see
    it.</p>
    <p>Three young Americans meet in Malaysia and enjoy the tourist attractions, including
    lots of cheap hashish. Tony and Sheriff return to the states, leaving Lewis behind with
    the hash stash. He&#146;s busted for drugs. Two years later, Tony and Sheriff are getting
    on with their lives in New York when they are contacted by Beth, Lewis&#146; lawyer
    (outstandingly played by Anne Heche). They learn that Lewis has been convicted and
    sentenced to death. The sentence will be carried out in eight days.</p>
    <p>Beth explains that she has struck an unwritten deal with the Attorney General of
    Malaysia. If Tony and Sheriff return to Malaysia, Lewis&#146; life will be spared. If both
    Tony and Sheriff return, each must serve three years in prison. If only one returns, he
    must serve six years. It&#146;s a classic and quite literal version of the prisoner&#146;s
    dilemma. Beth is incredibly persistent in trying to persuade them to go, but she is far
    from candid in her dealings with them. And she begins a passionate affair with Sheriff.</p>
    <p>We won&#146;t disclose any more of the plot, but consider the issues raised just by
    this brief summary.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian drug law imposes an incredibly harsh and unjust penalty&#151;a mandatory
    death sentence for possession of drugs for personal use. This occurs because the law
    irrebuttably presumes that possession of more than a minimum amount of the drug (200 grams
    of cannabis, a figure which the film reduces to 100) is trafficking. About 150 people have
    been executed under this law, including a number of foreigners.</p>
    <p>Are we being ethnocentric here? At the clemency hearing that occurs near the end of the
    film, the Malaysian Chief Justice says that Americans don&#146;t understand the harshness
    of Malaysia&#146;s drug laws. But he observes that Malaysians don&#146;t understand the
    American tolerance toward drugs and the tremendous damage they&#146;ve done to our
    society.</p>
    <p>Many of the best films about law have dramatized the gulf between law and justice.
    Recall <i><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?To+Kill+a+Mockingbird+(1962)">To Kill a
    Mockingbird</a>,</i> when an obviously innocent black man is convicted of rape, or <i><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Billy+Budd+(1962)">Billy Budd</a>, </i>which involved a
    mandatory death penalty for striking an officer. Or <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Paths+of+Glory+(1957)"><i>Paths of Glory</i></a> in which
    soldiers are selected by lot to be shot because an entire army unit failed to capture an
    enemy position. I believe <i>Return to Paradise</i> deserves a place alongside these great
    films. And it may even cause us to question our own incredibly severe minimum penalties
    for drug offenses, especially for possession of crack cocaine.</p>
    <p>The reality, however, is that it is extremely unlikely that Lewis would be executed for
    this offense. According to Professor Sid Harring, only the very worst traffickers or the
    very most unlucky people are actually executed. There are about ten executions a year but
    there are probably at least 1000 people who are caught by the police and could potentially
    get the death penalty.</p>
    <p>Harring observes that the police drop a large number of cases that might be prosecuted.
    He also points out that the judiciary manipulates the drug law to acquit a large number of
    people who are probably guilty. This is to be expected when the penalty is so out of
    proportion to the gravity of the offense. Thus a large number of defendants are acquitted
    because they sustain the burden of showing that they lacked &quot;knowledge&quot; of the
    presence of drugs in their bags or rooms (for example, because there were multiple
    occupants of the room). Other decisions have allowed defendants to rebut the presumption
    that possession of specified amounts automatically shows trafficking (though this seems to
    contravene the statute). Finally, a good many defendants win on appeal or receive
    clemency.</p>
    <p>The clemency hearing that occurs in the film is quite inaccurate. The Chief Justice
    would not preside over such a hearing. Harring says he pointed this out to the filmmakers
    but they felt that they needed the drama of a judicialized hearing. Instead, the clemency
    hearing would be provided by an administrative pardons board. The Attorney General would
    take part in this proceeding and probably could control the outcome. Therefore, it is
    possible (though unlikely) that the Attorney General would have struck the deal described
    in the film. It would not have been a plea bargain but instead an agreement by the
    Attorney General to recommend clemency for Lewis to the pardons board. It is not clear how
    the AG could have guaranteed to Tony and Sheriff that they would receive three or six year
    terms since plea bargaining as such does not exist in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>This film also raises troubling questions of personal responsibility. What <i>is</i>
    the moral obligation of Tony and Sheriff to return to Malaysia to serve three or six years
    in prison? Would <i>you</i> go? Lewis was only a casual acquaintance, not a lifelong
    friend. Even if the AG honors his promise and they have to serve only three or six years,
    they will do so in a very unpleasant, very dangerous third-world prison. Their lives and
    relationships will be left in shambles. Yet if they don&#146;t go and Lewis is hanged,
    they may feel remorse for the rest of their lives.</p>
    <p><i>Return to Paradise</i> also raises thorny questions of legal ethics. What, for
    example, is the ethical duty of a lawyer, who is representing a client sentenced to death,
    in trying to persuade non-clients to return to Malaysia? Certainly, Beth meets and exceeds
    the standard for zealous representation of her client.</p>
    <p>But in her dealings with Tony and Sheriff, Beth is less than candid (we&#146;re not
    disclosing here in what respect Beth misled Tony and Sheriff). Model Rule 4.1 states that
    in the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not &quot;knowingly make a false
    statement of material fact or law to a third person.&quot; The comment to Rule 4.1
    explains that the lawyer has no affirmative duty to inform an opposing party of relevant
    facts. Did Beth make false statements or tell half-truths? Or merely fail to inform Tony
    and Sheriff of relevant facts? And if she was untruthful, could her actions be justified
    by her client&#146;s horrible situation?</p>
    <p>Did Beth act unethically in starting an affair with Sheriff? Lawyer-client sex is
    highly frowned on today. Some states have banned it entirely, even if it is entirely
    consensual. Other states prohibit sexual relations if the client is abused or if the
    relationship would adversely affect the lawyer&#146;s ability to represent the client. But
    here Sheriff is not Beth&#146;s client, and the affair may well be in Lewis&#146; best
    interests. So maybe starting the affair was a smart and ethical strategic move.</p>
    <p>In addition to many other issues, <i>Return to Paradise</i> contains troubling material
    on the irresponsibility of the press. An ambitious American journalist gets wind of the
    story. Beth pleads with the journalist not to report it because any press disclosure will
    infuriate the Malaysians and torpedo the deal. Apparently hostile foreign press coverage
    hastened the execution of two Australians (Barlow and Chalmers). We won&#146;t tell you
    what happens, but let&#146;s just say that the story doesn&#146;t reflect well on the
    press.</p>
    <p>Like many works of popular culture about law, <i>Return to Paradise</i> raises all of
    these issues and more. It has haunted us and our families. See it if you get the chance.</p>
