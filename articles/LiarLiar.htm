    <p><font face="Verdana"><strong><em>By Robert L. Waring </em>(November 1997)</strong></font><i><p>
    <p></i><font face="Verdana">Now out on video, <i>Liar, Liar</i> is another in a rapidly
    growing list of lawyer bashing movies. Some of the ads for the film contained the headline
    &quot;Lawyer, Lawyer&quot; which was crossed out with the words &quot;Liar, Liar&quot;
    written over in red. This tone is reinforced in the first scene where the lawyer&#146;s
    five-year-old son is asked to tell his kindergarten class what his father does for a
    living. He tells the them his father is a liar. When the teacher questions this, he
    explains that his father wears a suit, goes to the courthouse and talks to the judge.
    &quot;Oh, you mean a lawyer,&quot; she exclaims. The son shrugs his shoulders as if to
    say&#151;whatever.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">There are plenty of funny scenes, especially if one is in the mood
    for lawyer bashing. A judge says to the lawyer, &quot;One more word out of you, and
    I&#146;ll hold you in contempt.&quot; The lawyer, played by comic Jim Carey, replies,
    &quot;I hold myself in contempt, your honor. Why should you be any different?&quot; In the
    film makers&#146; minds, every lawyer in America deserves to engage in that sort of
    self-deprecation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The rather predictable plot is sort of a cross between <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Regarding+Henry+(1991)"><i>Regarding Henry</i></a>
    and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?My+Cousin+Vinny+(1992)"><i>My Cousin Vinny</i></a>.
    A lawyer too busy to care for his family is suddenly stricken with an affliction which
    cripples his ability to practice law in the manner to which he was accustomed, and he
    rediscovers the value of family bonds. In this case the affliction is an inability to lie.
    At the same time, a lawyer working under a considerable handicap nonetheless manages to
    win an important trial because he notices a small factual detail that everyone else had
    overlooked.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The most interesting thing about the movie, <i>Liar, Liar</i>, is
    not what&#146;s in it, but what was left out. This is best understood in the context of
    OJ, that paradigm shift that changed criminal law as we know it. The influence of OJ is
    felt in the initial seconds Carey is on the screen. One of the first persons he encounters
    while descending the court house steps is none other than OJ prosecutor Christopher
    Darden, appearing in a blink-of-an-eye cameo.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film originally introduced the Carey character in a four
    minute scene where he made a closing argument to a jury in a criminal trial. Carey&#146;s
    client, a rough looking type, is accused of robbing an elderly man at an ATM and stealing
    his wallet and his car. Carey explains his client&#146;s actions as being first motivated
    by fear&#151;he saw a reflection from the hologram on the old man&#146;s ATM card and
    thought the old man had a gun&#151;which was why he knocked the old man to the ground.
    Then, invoking the biblical parable of the Good Samaritan, Carey says his client borrowed
    the old man&#146;s Lexis so he could find a telephone to summon aid and borrowed his
    wallet so that he could identify the injured man to rescuers. Carey successfully
    transforms his robber-client into the heroic victim of an unfortunate misunderstanding.
    His sad tale continues with a similarly sympathetic, yet ridiculous explanation of his
    client&#146;s bashing the face of a female police officer while resisting arrest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">On the Signature Edition laser disk, which is contains the deleted
    scene, the director explains that he cut the four minute jury summation because it made
    the first act of the ninety-seven-minute movie too long. While this may speak volumes
    about the mentality and attention span of the target audience for this film, it leaves
    unanswered the question as to whether bad taste may have also been a factor in this
    editing choice. Even though this scene did not make the final cut, it is a valuable
    illustration of the fact that criminal defense lawyers have fallen a long way in Hollywood
    since Perry Mason. Criminal defense lawyers now have the lowest image in a profession of
    bottom feeders, and the bottom is nowhere in sight.</font></p>
