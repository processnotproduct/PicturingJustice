    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana">The Sweet Hereafter</font></h1>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana"><em>by Robert L. Waring </em></font></strong>(May 1998)</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film <i>The Sweet Hereafter</i> is very much a collaboration
    between the author of the book by the same name, Russell Banks, and the film&#146;s writer
    and director, Atom Egoyan. This congenial marriage of the skills of author and
    screenwriter is evidenced in their discussion on the alternate audio track of the
    laserdisc and in their 1997 interview on the PBS radio program <i><a href="http://whyy.org/freshair/BOFA/BOFA19971226.html">Fresh Air</a>.</i> <small>[To
    listen, you will need a copy of the <a href="http://www.real.com/products/player/index.html">free Real Audio Player</a>.]</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">As in many attempts at faithful translation from page to screen, <i>The
    Sweet Hereafter</i> crams too much information into the film&#146;s 112 minutes, often
    leaving the viewer confused or unaware of the subtleties flashing by. To fully appreciate
    the film, a viewer should either read the book first or see the film more than once. That
    being said, this emotional and haunting film is well worth a single viewing, and many of
    its images linger in the mind long after the credits roll.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film explores the effects of a fatal school bus crash on a
    small rural community, and portrays the unsuccessful efforts of a lawyer to win a large
    settlement for some of the now childless families. (The story in the novel was set in a
    small town in the Adirondacks, while the filmmakers chose western Canada as their locale.)
    The film flows (and sometimes leaps) back and forth between at least five different time
    frames. It shows the lawyer, played by Ian Holm, two decades earlier when he still had the
    affections of his former wife and of his baby daughter, now an adult drug addict. Life in
    the community before the bus accident is depicted along with disturbing imagery of the
    school bus&#146; journey on the day of the accident. The lawyer&#146;s efforts at
    recruiting clients after the crash occupy significant screen time, and are interspersed
    with his conversation two years later with a family friend. There is much more time travel
    here than in a typical film <i>about</i> time travel, such as the film <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Slaughterhouse+Five+(1972)"><i>Slaughterhouse Five</i></a>,
    based on the Kurt Vonnegut novel.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In the <em><font face="Verdana">Fresh Ai</font>r</em> radio
    interview, Banks explains that he wrote the book after interviewing residents of a small
    town in South Texas who lost their children in a school bus crash.&nbsp;Banks realized
    that two events tore the town apart: the crash, and the litigation which followed. He set
    out to write a novel illustrating the dangers of Americans' seeming obsession with
    explaining inexplicable tragedies, drawing at times on his personal experience with the
    loss of his brother in a train accident three decades before. For Armenian screenwriter
    and director Egoyan, the reference point was his own coming to terms with the genocide of
    Armenians a hundred years ago.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film negatively portrays the lawyer as an obstacle to the
    families' attempts to heal their grief&#151;little more than a sophisticated ambulance
    chaser. Holm masterfully shows how this personal injury attorney uses better sales skills
    than those possessed by most car salesmen to individually draw in each client. In one
    scene, he literally crawls on his hands and knees to show empathy with a potential
    clients&#146; feelings of helplessness. The book reportedly explains his pursuit of the
    elusive bus crash case as a catharsis for his rage against the unseen enemies that pulled
    his daughter into drug addiction. However, the film, by failing to reveal any legal cause
    of action, seems to presume that a fat fee is his primary goal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Upon seeing the horrifying image of the bus breaking through lake
    ice, my lawyer mind thought, &quot;Gee, if there had been an emergency exit on the roof of
    that bus, all those kids might have gotten out alive.&quot; The film&#146;s lawyer never
    gets that far. More than once, he admits that he has no idea what sort of negligence will
    be the basis for his suit. In one of the most heavily criticized traditions of modern day
    advocacy, he says, &quot;Someone died, so someone else has to pay.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">If the film has a hero (or shero), it is Nicole, a crippled
    survivor of the crash played by Sarah Polley. Her disability ends an incestuous
    relationship with her father and gives her the courage to single-handedly terminate the
    lawyer&#146;s greedy search for a villain. She is also the narrator of one of Director
    Egoyan&#146;s brilliant additions to film: the poem which tells the story of the Pied
    Piper, who lures all of the children away from a town, except one who, like Nicole, is
    lame. (As Egoyan admits on the laserdisc narration, he added some of his own verses to the
    original poem.) In one of the film&#146;s most profound moments, a child, soon to die in
    the accident, asks Nicole why is was&#151;if the Piper was so persuasive that he lead all
    the children away from the town&#151;that he could not convince the townspeople simply to
    pay him for his rat removal services. &quot;He must have wanted to punish them,&quot; she
    responds. That answer speaks volumes about our adversary system of tort litigation.</font></p>
