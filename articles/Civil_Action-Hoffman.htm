    many viewers I have spoken to, <i>A Civil Action</i> represents an honest, accurate
    description of a civil lawsuit. The movie depicted the massive amount of monies used for
    travel, fees and experts, the incredible number of hours Schlichtmann and the other
    partners put into trial preparation and discovery, and the tedious task of tracking down
    witnesses and taking depositions. For me, however, <i>A Civil Action</i> represented a
    negative portrayal of lawyers. It reinforced the already negative image society has of
    today&#146;s lawyers. Jan Schlichtmann appeared to care more about money and publicity
    than doing what was best for his clients.</font></td>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="534" colspan="3"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana" size="3"> One of the moments that bothered me most was a scene towards the
    beginning of the movie. In one of Jan&#146;s first meetings with the Woburn clients, Anne
    Anderson tells Jan that she and the rest of the families do not care about the money. They
    only want an apology for what W. R. Grace and Beatrice Foods did to their children. Jan
    states that the companies will be made to apologize with their money. Jan never explains
    to Anderson that it is very unlikely, if not impossible, that W. R. Grace and Beatrice
    Foods will apologize. If they did, both companies would be admitting liability that would
    expose them to an outrageous number of lawsuits from anyone who had ever even driven
    through the small town of Woburn and stopped long enough to have a drink of their water.
    If you can, picture at least a hundred sharks swarming and feasting at the smell of even a
    single drop of blood in the water. That would be the effect of a W. R. Grace and Beatrice
    Foods apology. Jan should have told that to the families and explained <img src="images/plaintiff.jpg" alt="The Plaintiff" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="left" width="198" height="108">that money is all they would be likely
    to get from the companies. It was Jan&#146;s responsibility as an attorney to explain that
    the reason money would have to serve as an apology is because it would hurt the companies
    to lose it. It would serve as a punishment. In addition, Jan should have explained that
    Courts usually force the companies to pay for the cleanup and even if this Court would
    not, someone would. Companies do not like to lose money and they like negative publicity
    even less. It was Jan&#146;s responsibility to tell the families that going after money
    was the only way to make the companies realize that what they did was wrong and to ensure
    that they would never repeat their behavior somewhere else. Without this explanation from
    Jan, viewers are left to believe that Jan does not care what his clients want. It makes
    Jan look greedy and Jan&#146;s lawyering look unethical.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></td>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Jan&#146;s ego
    gets in his way throughout the movie. It does not appear that Jan realizes that he is in
    over his head until the end of the movie when he and his partners find themselves sitting
    in what is left of their office. Only then does Jan finally realize that the secretary and
    staff are gone, most of the equipment and furnishings are gone, and the utilities have
    been disconnected. Throughout the movie, Jan repeatedly orders the firm&#146;s accountant
    to get more money. Jan has always come through in the end and the Bank has never thought
    twice about loaning the firm as much money as it needed. Jan has always believed that the
    money would be there. It does not appear that the idea ever crosses Jan&#146;s mind that
    the Bank would eventually turn him down for a loan. This makes Jan appear even more greedy
    and self-absorbed. The movie never shows Jan checking into the firm&#146;s financial
    situation or his own. He does not even realize that his Porsche and condo were mortgaged.
    He is never shown questioning his behavior.</font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other things bother me. First,
    throughout the movie, Jan is inundated with settlement offers. Not only does he never once
    take an offer back to his clients, but he never seriously considers any of the offers. In
    fact, the movie never even shows Jan consulting with his partners. The one settlement
    negotiation Jan attended with his partners proves to be a disaster. Jan inflates the
    numbers to such an extent that not even his partners take him seriously. I believe that to
    be a violation of the ABA Ethical Code of Conduct. Second, Beatrice Foods&#146; attorney,
    Facher, played by Robert Duvall, tells Jan that he will never let the families of the dead
    children testify. Jan appears so self-absorbed that he never even questions what Facher is
    telling him. Jan never does any research to determine how Facher might plan to keep the
    families off the stand. Then, three months into the trial, Jan appears taken aback when he
    is called into Judge Skinner&#146;s office because Facher is objecting to the
    families&#146; testimony. When Facher succeeds in keeping the families off the stand, the
    only excuse Jan finds is that Judge Skinner hates him. A good attorney would have
    anticipated and been prepared for Facher&#146;s move.</font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Some viewers I have spoken with seem
    to believe that Jan does an about-face or has an epiphany in the end. They believe this
    occurs when he sends his files and evidence on the Woburn case to the EPA. However, I do
    not believe that he ever regrets his behavior or actions. It appears to me that he sends
    the information to the EPA in a last-ditch effort to prove that he is right. Again, it is
    all about his ego and the publicity. Throughout the movie, Jan always knows he is right
    about the Woburn dumping but he just cannot get the information to prove it. When he
    finally does get the information, he does not have the money to do anything with it. So,
    there Jan sits, with the evidence he needs to prove he was right all along. Few other
    people believe that he is right and those who do are not speaking to him. He has to do
    something. Viewers see Jan struggling to determine what he should do. Then, he does it: he
    sends the evidence to the only people who can clear his name. He also includes a letter
    which some viewers believe is meant as an apology on his part. I believe it is Jan&#146;s
    way of getting the attention of the EPA. Jan&#146;s not stupid. The EPA is swamped with
    more cases than they have the manpower to investigate. This is simply Jan&#146;s way of
    getting his case moved to the top of the EPA pile.</font><font face="Arial"><p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"></font><font face="Verdana">Jan Schlichtmann, as portrayed in <i>A
    Civil Action</i>, is not a good role model for what a lawyer should be. </font></p>
