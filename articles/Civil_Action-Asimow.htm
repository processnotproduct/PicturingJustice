    <p>by Michael Asimow<small><font face="Verdana"><em><strong> - UCLA Law School</strong> </em>(February
    1999)</font></small></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana" size="4"><strong> A</strong></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"> tannery and a factory in Woburn, Massachusetts dump toxic
    chemicals on the ground. The poison percolates into the water table and is pumped by two
    wells into the drinking water. Eight neighborhood children die of leukemia. Their families
    sue Beatrice Foods and W. R. Grace, the megafirms responsible for the pollution. Can the
    adversary system determine whether toxins dumped by these companies made the children
    sick? <p>
    <p><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; According to the new film <i>A Civil Action, </i>the answer is a resounding
    no. As defense counsel sagely observes, truth lies at the bottom of a bottomless <img src="images/4000anim.gif" alt="4000anim.gif (21093 bytes)" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="158" height="66">pit--depths the trial process
    cannot hope to plumb. Relying on the adversary system and lay juries to find the truth
    simply compounds the disaster and creates more tragedy. Jonathan Harr's marvelous 1995
    book told the story of the Woburn litigation in gripping detail. The film dramatizes the
    human side of the litigation, while presenting the realities of complex tort litigation
    more successfully than any other film. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan Schlictmann runs a successful boutique plaintiff's personal injury
    firm. He impulsively decides to represent the Woburn plaintiffs, a catastrophic error.
    Schlictmann is shown to be a person who is fanatically devoted to his clients but almost
    totally lacking in judgment, especially about money. To prepare the Woburn case,
    Schlictmann has to front the cost of elaborate medical and hydrological studies. He spends
    money freely, ignoring all danger signals. Three and a half million dollars later,
    Schlictmann and his partners are flat broke. They have lost their homes to the bank and
    toil in a dark and empty office. And the trial has just begun. </p>

    Schlictmann is up against two major Boston law firms and two able antagonists, the wily
    Jerome Facher of Hale &amp; Dorr, who represents Beatrice, and William Cheeseman, of
    Foley, Hoag &amp; Eliot, who represents Grace. These guys play for keeps and can bring
    unlimited financial and personal resources to the fray. Needless to say, Schlictmann's
    tiny firm is hopelessly outgunned. Even worse, the case is removed to federal court and
    heard by Judge Walter Skinner, who has a personal relationship with Facher and despises
    personal injury lawyers. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Popular culture occasionally depicts plaintiffs going up against big
    hardball-playing defense firms. Normally, the result is a Hollywood happy ending. In <i>The
    Verdict</i>, for example, Frank Galvin overcomes alcoholism and incompetence, as well as
    the defense's dirty tricks, to win a medical malpractice case--but only by chicanery and
    incredible luck. In <i>Class Action</i>, Jedediah Ward wins an exploding automobile case
    against a big firm that employs all sorts of unethical tactics--but only because a defense
    lawyer betrays her client. On TV's <i>The Practice</i> last year, Lindsay Dole somehow
    gets a cigarette case to the jury and wins bigtime. And in John Grisham's <i><strong><a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0161447.html" target="_blank">The Runaway Jury</a></strong>,
    </i>another cigarette case is successful, despite defense chicanery, but only because of
    outrageous jury misconduct.</p>

        defense counsel to win a monster verdict. The film returns to the reality level at the
        end, however: the money evaporates when the defendant files Chapter 11. <i>A Civil Action </i>stands
        alone as the most realistic film about a complex civil trial ever made. An underfunded and
        outmanned personal injury firm is eaten alive by its big firm adversaries. No happy ending

    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; A Civil Action</i> dramatizes the gritty details of civil litigation
    better than any other film. Discovery, for example, is shown as it really is--costly,
    tedious, and exhausting. With nobody to cover the endless depositions for him, Schlictmann
    gets worn down and loses his temper. The discovery process does turn up one truthful
    witness, however--a Grace employee who witnessed the dumping. The rest of the defense
    witnesses claim they never heard or saw any dumping at all. <i>Class Action</i> and <i>The
    Rainmaker </i>also had discovery sequences, but they did not capture reality nearly as
    well. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the film graphically depicts the frightening world of
    settlement negotiations. <i>The Verdict</i> also contained a fine settlement sequence, in
    which another biased judge tried to browbeat the plaintiff's lawyer into taking a lowball
    settlement offer. <i>A Civil Action</i> is better, because it focuses on the very real and
    scary problems of deciding how much to ask for and how to get to the bottom line. By
    grossly misjudging the value of his case, Schlictmann dooms his clients to a jury trial of
    a hideously complex case. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge Skinner trifurcates the issues and requires the jury to answer
    detailed interrogatories. The first phase concerns whether the companies dumped toxic
    waste and whether it migrated to the wells. The second phase concerns whether toxins in
    this concentration can cause leukemia. The third phase concerns plaintiffs' damages.
    Splitting up the issues is not uncommon in complex cases, because it simplifies the trial
    process. If plaintiff loses in any phase, the trial stops. However, the timing of Judge
    Skinner's critical ruling (just before trial begins) seems dubious. More important, the
    film shows how devastating the process of splitting up the issues can be to the plaintiff.
    The jury never gets to hear the parents testify about the agonizing deaths of their
    children--the evidence that would have made all the difference (and which Facher vowed the
    jury would never hear). Instead the jury endures highly technical expert testimony and
    perjured accounts of whether any dumping ever occurred and must answer mysterious sets of
    interrogatories about the precise dates that dumping and well contamination might have
    occurred. . </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Facher is a master of a typical defense tactic: the relentless use of
    evidentiary objections. Indeed, he tells his trial tactics class at Harvard that if you
    fall asleep during a trial, wake up objecting. The result is that Schlictmann never
    develops any momentum in the presentation of his case. The constant wrangling over
    evidence distracts and frustrates the jury. Once more, the adversary system is shown as
    the enemy of truth finding. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The result of the trial was disaster for the plaintiff. Because of
    consistent perjury by the owner and employees of the tannery owned by Beatrice,
    Schlictmann cannot prove that it dumped anything. The jury verdict in phase 1 therefore is
    for Beatrice but against Grace. Even the favorable Grace verdict contains some very
    unfavorable findings about the dates of contamination, raising the definite possibility
    that Grace could avoid phase two. Desperate and out of money, Schlictmann is browbeaten
    into accepting a low-ball settlement offer from a Grace executive who handles the
    negotiation masterfully. Schlictmann's clients turn against him, his law firm breaks up,
    and he has to file for personal bankruptcy (we see the deeply humiliating bankruptcy
    hearing). His life and career are shattered. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, there is more. After the trial, Schlictmann stumbles on evidence that
    the tannery owner removed large volumes of toxic waste from the site. This leads to
    discovery of clear evidence that the tannery owner committed perjury at the trial.
    Nevertheless, the apparently biased Judge Skinner refuses to grant a new trial against
    Beatrice. </font></td>

    <td valign="top" width="559" colspan="3"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Here
    the film pulls its punch by not implicating Beatrice's attorney. According to the book,
    what actually happened was that Beatrice failed to turn over a consultant's report that
    would have allowed Schlictmann to fill the holes in his case against Beatrice. The First
    Circuit's decision states that Schlictmann requested all such reports and Facher's firm
    replied that none existed. <i>Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc</i>., <a href="articles/ANDERSON.htm">862 F.2d 910</a>, 927-28 (1988). If
    true, this seems like serious discovery misconduct. I don't know why the filmmakers fudged
    this part of the tale, but the full story would have deepened the film's critique of the
    adversary system. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The adversary system and jury trials may produce an
    acceptable brand of justice. Perhaps it's the way to go in criminal law, where we
    willingly tolerate inefficiency and we seek a community judgment on the defendant's
    conduct. But the adversary system, which consists of teams of attorneys trying to hammer
    each other and conceal as much of the truth as they can, is hopelessly inept when employed
    to discover truth in matters of scientific controversy. Does anyone believe that justice
    is served by relying on adversarial lawyers, passive and inexpert judges, and lay juries
    to resolve complex and inherently unanswerable scientific questions? It's bad enough when
    the two sides are equally matched, but the situation is utterly hopeless when one side is
    vastly outgunned. When a biased judge and plenty of perjury are mixed into the brew, the
    outcome can only be more victims and more disaster but little or no justice. </p></font>
