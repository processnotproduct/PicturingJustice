    <p><strong><font face="Verdana"><em>by Robert L. Waring </em></font></strong>(January 1998)</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">You can image how easy this movie was to pitch in Hollywood.&nbsp;
    An offbeat dark comedy that can be summed up in one sentence:&nbsp; A hitman, beginning to
    doubt his career choice, returns to his hometown to attend his tenth high school reunion
    and attempts to reunite with the woman he left behind.&nbsp; There is plenty of gunplay,
    for those viewers interested in action, and romantic tension for those who prefer a love
    story.&nbsp; Sounds like the perfect date movie, but does it have anything else to offer
    the video renter?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The moral angst of the troubled hitman, played by John Cusack, is
    at times both amusing and thought provoking.&nbsp; Given the common metaphor of the
    attorney as a hired gun, several of the hitman's problems seem relevant to moral dilemmas
    faced by attorneys.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Cusack's hitman is a generally sympathetic character.&nbsp; As he
    is frequently rationalizing, he kills only people who deserve it (not members of
    Greenpeace, for example).&nbsp; &quot;There is a reason I show up at your door,&quot; he
    says.&nbsp; Yet in the same breath, he takes no responsibility for the morality of his
    actions.&nbsp;&nbsp; A recurring theme is the hitman's excuse to his victims or to those
    who merely question the propriety of his line of work. &nbsp; &quot;Look, it's not me [who
    is deciding that the victim's past acts justify his execution].&nbsp; I'm just in this for
    the money.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Isn't this the same scenario that is played out daily in law
    offices, boardrooms and courtrooms across America?&nbsp; Everyone wants to demonize their
    opponents, so as to justify the means used to exact retribution, but very few want to take
    actual responsibility for passing judgment or for justifying the sometimes
    disproportionate vengeance sought.&nbsp; At the end of the day, most people leave the
    office secure in the knowledge that they are only doing it for the money.&nbsp; Someone
    else has to take responsibility for that, whether it's the client or the system.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">There are a number of memorable scenes in the film. &nbsp; Among
    them:&nbsp; an attorney proves that the pen is mightier than the gun, and the hitman
    demonstrates how television can ruin your mind.&nbsp; To explain these here would give
    away too much.</font></p>
