    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Verdana"><em>By Michael Asimow, UCLA Law School </em></font></strong>(May
    1998)</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film<i> Dangerous Beauty</i> is about Veronica Franco, a
    Venetian courtesan who lived from 1546-1591. The movie is loosely based on <i>The Honest
    Courtesan</i> (Univ. of Chicago Press, 1992), a scholarly book by Margaret F. Rosenthal,
    who is a professor of Italian at USC. The film is interesting to law and popular culture
    junkies because it culminates with Franco&#146;s witchcraft trial before the Inquisition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But before we get to the trial, let&#146;s talk about 16th Century
    Venice and the real Veronica Franco (played by Catherine McCormack in the film). Venice,
    founded in myth by Venus rising from the sea, always featured two closely linked iconic
    visions of the goddess&#151;as pure and inviolate virgin and as symbol of love and
    pleasure. And at the time everybody associated Venice with love and pleasure. Some
    historians believe that there were an astounding 11,000 prostitutes in 16th century Venice
    out of a total population of about 100,000 (Rosenthal finds the figure exaggerated but
    even half that number would be amazing).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Essentially, a young Venetian women who aspired to a decent
    lifestyle could enter a convent, marry a rich man (which required the woman to come up
    with a substantial dowry), or become a courtesan (essentially a high-priced prostitute).
    Although not shown in the film, Franco did in fact marry a physician as a young woman, but
    that marriage soon ended. Somehow her parents came up with the necessary dowry (which
    Franco fought for years to reclaim from her husband). Franco then became a courtesan (as
    her mother had once been).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Franco acquired rich and powerful patrons, such as Dominico
    Venier. As a result, she achieved astounding upward mobility. She acquired an excellent
    education, although how she managed it is unknown. She had a successful career as a poet.
    Tintoretto painted her portrait, which is featured on the front of Rosenthal&#146;s book,
    which shows that she was quite fetching.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film correctly reflects the difference in lifestyles between
    successful courtesans and wives of rich men. Wives were cloistered creatures without
    education or financial independence, their life devoted entirely to home and family.
    Courtesans, on the other hand, could mingle freely with the rich and famous, acquire
    education and wealth of their own, participate in literary, political and intellectual
    circles, and even publish their work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Franco was incredibly successful in this milieu; between 1570 and
    1580, she edited works of various authors and published books of her poetry as well as
    epistolary works. She was greatly concerned with the plight of younger women who lacked
    dowries; her published letters often refer to their plight and her wills left money to
    help poor women.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Franco&#146;s success inspired extreme jealousy from male
    courtiers and poets whose position and patronage she greatly threatened. As in the film, a
    particularly venomous rival was Maffio Venier, a nephew of Franco&#146;s patron Domenico
    Venier. Maffio repeatedly attacked Franco by name in satirical and often obscene verse.
    Franco&#146;s poems and letters effectively strike back at Maffio and defend the role of
    courtesans in Venetian society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Although the film does not show it, Franco struggled to raise a
    number of children; she had six, all by different fathers, of whom three sons survived
    infancy. She suffered ruined relationships and, especially late in her life, severe
    economic difficulties. The love story between Franco and Marco Venier (Domenico&#146;s
    other nephew), which is central to the film, is apparently greatly exaggerated (although
    there is evidence that the two were intimate in real life). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">As in the film, Franco really had an erotic encounter with King
    Henri III of France when he arrived in town (Franco was evidently a major tourist
    attraction). Because the patronage of the King of France would be exceptional valuable,
    Franco wrote poems about Henri and dedicated works of poetry to him. However, their actual
    relationship did not have the historic importance ascribed to it in the film. In the
    movie, after a delightful night of machistic lovemaking with Franco, Henri makes French
    naval power available to Venice in its war with the Turks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The first two thirds of the film are basically a fun sex romp with
    poetry contests, beautiful costumes, and stunning views of Venice. I, for one, found the
    film lacking in emotional resonance, although a majority of those I&#146;ve asked about it
    (particularly women) really liked it and empathized strongly with Franco&#146;s character.
    One student remarked that she found the film incredibly empowering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The last third of the film turns dark. The plague (and numerous
    other misfortunes) savaged Venice from 1575-77 and many women, especially courtesans, are
    placed on trial by the Inquisition. The theory is that the tragedies that befall Venice
    resulted from its licentious lifestyle. Thus prostitutes are set up to take the fall. In
    the film, Franco is accused of witchcraft, since she had obviously bewitched legions of
    men. She makes a stirring statement on behalf of women, however, and is saved from certain
    death when her many clients are shamed by Marco into standing up for her.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In real life, Franco was in fact tried twice by the Inquisition in
    1580 for the alleged offense of performing heretical incantations in her home. Chapter 5
    of Rosenthal&#146;s book contains a wealth of interesting and valuable information about
    the various inquisitorial trials for heresy and witchcraft that occurred around this time
    in Venice and about Franco&#146;s trials in particular. Nobody in Venice was condemned to
    death or severely tortured as a result of these trials, but conviction would mean public
    humiliation and severe penalties such as banishment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Franco was denounced anonymously by Ridolfo Vanitelli, her
    son&#146;s tutor. Vanitelli&#146;s denunciation may have been intended as revenge, because
    Franco had earlier cast suspicion on him when she reported a theft of various precious
    items from her home. She was then robbed again, and Vanitelli may have feared that she
    would accuse him of being the thief; thus his denunciation of Franco may have been a
    preemptive strike. Vanitelli accused her of performing incantations that were designed to
    discover the identity of the thief (and also to inspire various merchants to love her).
    His accusations also dwelt on her behavior as a prostitute and reflected his intense envy
    at her wealth and powerful friends. And for good measure, he accused her of eating meat on
    Fridays. The charge of performing heretical incantations was potentially quite serious
    because of the risk that she might be invoking the power of the devil.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The trials were strictly in the inquisitorial mode; there were no
    witnesses or defense counsel. The trial consisted of Franco being interrogated by the
    inquisitor. Fortunately, Franco was very experienced in defending herself against
    invective from rivals such as Maffio Venier; she used this experience to good effect in
    her trials. Once again, Domenico Venier&#146;s patronage was invaluable; Rosenthal
    believes that Domenico&#146;s influence resulted in the failure of the Inquisition to
    proceed against her after the initial interrogations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In both of the trials, Franco admitted performing superstitious
    rituals in her home, but claimed she did not take them seriously. She tried to shift
    blame, by saying the rituals were the idea of her neighbors and her servants, including
    Vanitelli. At the right moment, she was contrite. She emphatically denied eating meat or
    other forbidden foods on Friday, except when she was seriously ill or pregnant (which was
    often). She steadfastly denied that diabolism was involved in any ritual. She remained
    composed at all times, despite the peril of the situation. The trials were suspended
    without findings and no witnesses were ever called against her. Despite the ambiguously
    favorable conclusion of the trials, events did not go in Franco&#146;s favor. By 1582,
    Domenico Venier was dead and Franco was impoverished. She never recovered the stolen
    articles.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Although Franco&#146;s inquisitorial trials lacked the high drama
    ascribed to them in <i>Dangerous Beauty</i>, the actual events were nevertheless quite
    fascinating, particularly Franco&#146;s skill in parrying a determined inquisitor.
    Franco&#146;s life is truly inspiring. Lacking any money or familial influence, she
    capitalized on her intelligence and talent, as well as her brilliant personality, physical
    beauty and erotic skills. Overcoming powerful legal and literary adversaries, she attained
    fame as a published poet and author and became a participant in the intellectual and
    political events of her time. She is a historic figure worthy of our attention and
    admiration more than four hundred years after her death.</font></p>
