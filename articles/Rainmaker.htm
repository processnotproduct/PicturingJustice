    <td valign="top"><h1><font face="Verdana">The Winemaker</font></h1>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><strong><em>By Robert L. Waring </em>(November 1997)</strong></font><i><p>
    <p></i><font face="Verdana">The sixth adaptation of a John Grisham novel,<i> The Rainmaker</i>,
    is one of those rare legal films where the lawyers in the courtroom must ask permission
    from the judge to approach a witness and are admonished for failing to do so. It tells the
    story of a recent law school graduate with a conscience trying not to starve in Memphis.
    Along the way he makes a lot of mistakes, and the audience gets to see his skills develop.
    (This is a pseudo-realistic film.) The young lawyer, played by the previously unknown Matt
    Damon, goes to work for a gangster lawyer named Bruiser, played by barely recognizable
    Mickey Rourke. Damon takes on a large and evil insurance company with somewhat predictable
    results. (This is also a Hollywood film.) Jon Voight plays Damon&#146;s nemesis, the
    slippery lead attorney for the insurance company. Danny Glover has fun playing a judge
    unsympathetic to insurance companies. Be forewarned that you should have a high tolerance
    for voice-over narration to enjoy this film, there is a lot of it. It partly makes up for
    some needed character development, but it does create many pauses in the flow.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">It was a surprise that Francis Ford Coppola directed and wrote the
    screenplay (with Grisham) for <i>The Rainmaker</i>. When asked about his choice, Coppola
    recently responded that it was a big story with fascinating characters and no serial
    killers. (Do you suppose that&#146;s how it was pitched in Hollywood?) It also seems he
    has made substantial recent investments in his winery, and as he has admitted in
    interviews, he needed the money. Curiously, Coppola has made a point of saying that <i>The
    Rainmaker</i> examines the notion of &quot;selling out.&quot; In one crucial scene,
    Coppola even has Damon depart from the Grisham novel to publicly accuse his opponent of
    &quot;selling out.&quot; Given the caliber of some of Coppola&#146;s other films, one
    might suspect that life imitates art in this case. Be that as it may, it struck me that
    Paramount Pictures got its money&#146;s worth from Coppola. A number of critics, including
    this one, are calling <i>The Rainmaker</i> the best adaptation of a Grisham novel to date.
    Coppola's skill is evident in the film, including his choices in background sound and
    music.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One reason for the film's success is its liberal use of humor. The
    novel was more comical than Grisham&#146;s other works and Coppola has emphasized that in
    his adaptation. As tired as I am of seeing Danny DeVito on the screen, his interpretations
    of a short, ambulance chasing &quot;para-lawyer&quot; (his euphemism for a law school
    graduate who has not been admitted to the bar) are wonderfully funny.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">As is typical of my viewing films with law themes in San
    Francisco, it was clear from the timing and extent of audience laughter that the theater
    contained a large number of attorneys. One scene in the movie was particularly telling.
    DeVito advises Damon to forget what he learned in law school and instead to follow three
    simple rules: &quot;Fight for your clients. Refrain from stealing their money. <i>Try</i>
    not to lie.&quot; This is followed by Damon&#146;s recitation of several lawyer jokes in
    narration, with a warning that lawyers should try to avoid becoming a lawyer joke
    themselves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">There seem to be two overarching themes/messages in <i>The
    Rainmaker</i>. The first is that a lawyer should not tolerate domestic violence. Although
    Grisham wrote the novel before the OJ verdict, <i>The Rainmaker</i> is in a sense a small
    redemption for a profession tainted (in some minds) by the efforts of Messrs. Cochran, et
    al. The film presents a lawyer who cares about domestic violence and does &quot;the right
    thing,&quot; even if he does have the selfish motive of romance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The second message is much the same as that of the recent film, <a href="devilsad.htm"><i>Devil&#146;s Advocate</i></a>: the ultimate power of lawyering is
    ultimately corrupting. As the Damon says in narration, &quot;Each time you try a case, you
    step over the line. You do it enough times and you forget where the line is.&quot; The
    solution presented by the film is reminiscent of the scene early in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Man+for+All+Seasons%2C+A+(1966)"><i>A Man for All
    Seasons</i></a>, where Sir Thomas Moore advises a young protege to abandon the corrupt
    business of the royal court (the law) and retire to a university to teach. Moore thinks
    the young man will be happier there. Apparently, Grisham and Coppola agree with that
    sentiment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">A final note: in light of the efforts of the U.S. Attorney&#146;s
    Office to destroy California criminal defense attorney Patrick Hallinan in a recent
    unsuccessful prosecution, it was ironic to see that he served as a legal advisor on the
    film. Bruiser, Damon&#146;s boss, has some drug-dealing clients, which was Hallinan&#146;s
    specialty. However, Bruiser chooses to run rather than wage the fight Hallinan did.</font></p>
