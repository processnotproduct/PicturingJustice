    <td valign="top"><font size="5"><h1></h1></font><font face="Verdana">Intentional Omission of
    Emotional Distress</font>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><strong><em>by Robert L. Waring </em></strong>(November 1997)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film, <em>The People vs. Larry Flynt</em>, now on video,
    caused a stir because of its glorification of the life of Flynt, a pornographer who some
    think is more of a poster boy for misogyny than for the First Amendment. Although the film
    accurately portrayed certain events in Flynt&#146;s life, some critics have argued that
    its attempts at realism were selective and carefully intended to seduce audiences into
    accepting the filmmakers&#146; deification of Flynt as a national hero. Regardless of
    Flynt&#146;s status as a hero or as an enemy of public morals, is it likely that the
    attitudes of some of the film&#146;s viewers towards lawyers and the legal system changed
    because of these attempts at realism?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film&#146;s glorification of Flynt also extended to his
    lawyer, played by Edward Norton.&nbsp; (Norton was the altar-boy-defendant in <em><a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Primal+Fear+(1996)">Primal Fear</a>.</em>) In real
    life, there were several lawyers over the years, but the film represented them all with a
    single figure. Lawyers should be satisfied with this device, as it gave audiences the
    impression of the lawyer as a loyal and trusted counselor and advocate&#151;a friend for
    life who would take a bullet for his client. (Many of the movie reviews on the Web
    incorrectly assumed that there was only one lawyer in Flynt&#146;s real life.) Even though
    this celluloid lawyer did quit at one point when the Flynt&#146;s outlandish antics
    threatened to completely undermine the lawyer&#146;s efforts on Flynt&#146;s behalf, the
    lawyer was portrayed as such a part of the family that Flynt&#146;s wife, Althea,
    successfully begged him to return to her husband&#146;s side.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One of the film&#146;s biggest surprises was near the end. All the
    visual intensity of Larry Flynt&#146;s hedonism, which probably seemed like life on
    another planet to most viewers, was followed by a very life-like portrayal of oral
    argument before the United States Supreme Court. Or was it? [You can listen to an audio
    recording of the real oral argument in the case <em>Hustler Magazine v. Falwell</em> by
    visiting the website: <a href="http://oyez.at.nwu.edu/oyez.html">http://oyez.at.nwu.edu/oyez.html</a>
    and downloading the free Real Audio player and the audio file. The oral argument has also
    just been released in the audio cassette series: <em>May It Please the Court, The First
    Amendment</em>, edited by Peter Irons (The New Press 1997).]</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Director Milos Forman and producer Oliver Stone went to the
    trouble of constructing a replica of the Supreme Court interior inside an old train
    station. [For another perspective, see the book, <em>Name Above the Title</em>, in which
    director Frank Capra tells the story of how he built a replica of the House of
    Representatives for <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Mr%2E+Smith+Goes+to+Washington+(1939)"><em>Mr.
    Smith Goes to Washington</em></a>.] The filmmakers also hired actors who resembled the
    Justices that actually heard Flynt&#146;s case. For example, Justice Scalia (the actor)
    spoke with the same self-righteous wit as the real Scalia might have, or perhaps even as
    he did during the oral argument. Justice O&#146;Connor (the actor) did not speak during
    the film, but her ever present scowl made for great theater.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Yet, this Court scene seemed a wasted opportunity for public
    education. The Supreme Court is a powerful institution, and on some levels has more in
    common with the monarchy our forefathers rebelled against than does the institution of the
    Presidency. The Justices sit for life terms and have no visible accountability to the
    public. The Court scene shed very little light on the activities of the Court.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Although some viewers may have left the theater with a greater
    appreciation for the First Amendment&#146;s speech rights, the important protection that
    Flynt added was barely mentioned in the film. (After the <em>Hustler</em> case, an
    allegedly defamed public figure cannot circumvent the rigorous actual malice standard by
    bringing a claim using the lower burden of proof applied to intentional infliction of
    emotional distress.) Reviewing a transcript of the real oral argument, one can see that
    only about half of the scene&#146;s dialog attempts to track the real thing. The
    screenwriters wrote the other fifty percent, apparently deciding that the truth would not
    be entertaining enough. One clue that the film was dumbing down came when, after a few
    long shots of the Justices of Supreme Court and the spectators beginning take seats for
    the oral argument, the cry, &quot;Oyez, oyez, all persons having business before the
    Supreme Court of the United States&quot; was accompanied by the film caption: &quot;United
    States Supreme Court, Washington, D.C.&quot; No kidding.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The case presented to the Court in the film seemed to center on
    the substantial right of citizens to criticize public figures without fear of a suit for
    defamation. In this general context, the film gave Flynt credit for the achievement of
    rights granted nearly a quarter century earlier in <em>New York Times v. Sullivan</em>.
    What audiences may remember most is that Flynt the bad boy broke the presumptively stiff
    decorum of the Supreme Court, and in the end the unanimous decision in his favor meant
    that all of the Justices found him to have some redeeming qualities. Sounds just like a
    Hollywood movie.</font></p>
