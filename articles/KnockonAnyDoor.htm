    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana">Humphrey Bogart For the
    Defense&#151;<i>Knock on Any Door</i></font></h1>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><em><strong>By Michael Asimow, UCLA Law School</strong> </em>(January
    1998)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Humphrey Bogart fans (a group which surely includes all who visit
    this site) shouldn&#146;t overlook <i>Knock on Any Door</i> (Columbia 1949). In this film,
    Bogart plays lawyer Andrew Morton, a tough, skilled, and idealistic lawyer. Most of the
    great stars get to play a lawyer at one time or another; <i>Knock on Any Door</i> gave
    Bogart his chance. His portrayal of Andrew Morton is outstanding and inspiring.
    Morton&#146;s unswerving and self-sacrificing commitment to an unsavory client serves as a
    model for all lawyers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Morton clawed his way out of the slums to complete night law
    school, got his start by practicing criminal law, and finally has worked his way into a
    respectable property law practice. Indeed, his blue-blooded bosses are about to make him a
    partner when a voice from the past&#151;that of his old client Pretty Boy
    Romano&#151;yanks him back to his personal and professional roots. Romano, a thug played
    by John Derek, lives by the motto that all of us can embrace: live fast, die young, and
    have a good looking corpse. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Years ago, Morton&#146;s office defended Romano&#146;s father.
    Morton was busy and delegated the work to an associate who muffed it. Romano&#146;s father
    went to prison where he died before Morton could help him. This disaster shoved
    Romano&#146;s family into dire poverty and Romano himself into gangs and ultimately life
    as a career criminal. Morton always blamed himself. He spent years trying to atone for his
    mistake by helping Romano, both personally and professionally. Romano tries to go straight
    but after his wife&#146;s suicide, he sticks up a bar; as he flees, he shoots and kills a
    policeman. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Romano pleads with Morton to defend him and Morton just can&#146;t
    turn him down, even though doing so costs him his cherished law firm partnership. Romano,
    of course, professes his innocence of the crime; Morton doesn&#146;t know whether to
    believe him or not but he undertakes the defense. The whole sad history of the
    relationship between Morton and Romano and his family is developed during a series of
    flashbacks during Morton&#146;s opening statement.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The slam-bang trial scenes take up a substantial part of the movie
    and are quite effective dramatically. Both DA Kerman and Morton are highly aggressive in
    their tactics, although the rules of evidence take some big hits. Morton does quite well
    in sowing reasonable doubt. He also pulls off a nifty courtroom trick in discrediting the
    bartender as an eye witness. Inexplicably, for an experienced criminal who should know
    better, Romano insists on taking the stand against Morton&#146;s advice. And even more
    implausibly, he disintegrates under Kerman&#146;s super-aggressive cross-examination.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Now Morton&#146;s only hope is to argue against the death penalty.
    He dismisses the jury and pleads Romano guilty, hoping the judge can be talked out of the
    ultimate penalty. This is the same maneuver attempted by Clarence Darrow (memorably played
    by Orson Welles) in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Compulsion+(1959)"><i>Compulsion</i></a>.
    Defending thrill-killers Leopold and Loeb, Darrow dwelt on the inhumanity of the death
    penalty. Morton takes a different tack. His emotional argument is based on a sort of
    sociological determinism. Given the terrible conditions in the slums, it was inevitable
    that Romano would turn to a life of crime. &quot;Knock on any door,&quot; Morton argues,
    and you&#146;ll find another potential Pretty Boy Romano. To preserve a bit of suspense,
    we won&#146;t disclose here whether this ploy is successful in saving Romano from the
    chair. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Bogart appears in two other law films. He plays Captain Queeg in
    the immortal <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Caine+Mutiny%2C+The+(1954)"><i>The
    Caine Mutiny</i></a> (Columbia 1954), where he collapses under Barney Greenwald&#146;s
    reluctant but penetrating cross examination. And he has a rather weak role as a crusading
    district attorney (supposedly based on Thomas E. Dewey) in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Marked+Woman+(1937)"><i>Marked Woman</i></a>
    (Warner Brothers 1937). <i>Marked Woman</i> was a star vehicle for Bette Davis and is
    interesting to Bogart fans because Mayo Methot played one of the group of prostitutes
    depicted in the film. It was her last major role, while Bogart&#146;s career was just
    taking off. Bogart and Methot got married and the result was total disaster for both of
    them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><i>Knock on Any Door</i> was Nicholas Ray&#146;s directoral debut.
    The film was made by Bogart&#146;s independent production company, Santana, after Bogart
    finally broke away from Warner Brothers. The film would have been far stronger if Marlon
    Brando had played Romano, as was originally planned, but Brando withdrew after the death
    of producer Mark Hellinger. Some of the material in this commentary was drawn from <i>Bogart</i>,
    the excellent biography by A. M. Sperber and Eric Lax.</font></p>
