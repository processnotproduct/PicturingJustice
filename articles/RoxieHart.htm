    <p><font face="Verdana"><strong><em>by Michael Asimow, UCLA Law School</em></strong>
    &nbsp;(November, 1997)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">This commentary focuses on two older courtroom comedies--<em>Roxie
    Hart</em> and <em>The Big Hangover</em>. Both films are available on video. If your local
    store doesn't have them, you can rent or buy them from <a href="http://www.reel.com">reel.com</a>.
    One film is great, one is lousy, but both of them are full of interesting insights about
    law, lawyers, and the legal system.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><big><em>Roxie Hart</em></big> (1942) is one of the best and
    funniest legal comedies every made. The Kander &amp; Ebb musical &quot;Chicago&quot;
    (currently in revival on Broadway) is based on the film. Ginger Rogers plays Roxie Hart, a
    gorgeous showgirl on trial for murder. In fact, Roxie is innocent but decides to stand
    trial anyway because the publicity will be good for her career. Adolphe Menjou plays her
    lawyer, Billy Flynn, who specializes exclusively in representing women who have killed
    their husbands or lovers. In Chicago, juries adore these women and they are never
    convicted. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">For those interested in lawyer portrayals in the movies, Flynn is
    the classic shyster lawyer. He concocts a purely fictitious press bio for Roxie and makes
    up an equally bogus defense for her to use at trial. The use of perjured testimony is
    taken for granted. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The media coverage of the trial is particularly funny; it's
    broadcast on the radio with commercials at every opportunity. Whenever anything good
    happens in the trial, photographers rush forward to take pictures. The judge always gets
    into the picture because he's running for re-election and the publicity couldn't hurt. And
    the dance scenes in jail, featuring the classic &quot;black bottom,&quot; are just out of
    sight.</font></p>
    <p><a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Roxie+Hart+(1942)" target=""><img src="../images/center.gif" border="0" height="69" width="130" align="center" hspace="10" alt="Click here for hyper link"></a><font face="Verdana"><strong><small>The Internet Movie
    Database for <em>Roxie Hart</em></small></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><big><em>The Big Hangover</em></big> (1951), which ran recently on
    Turner Classic Movies, is a loser. It's an unfunny comedy about a young lawyer, David
    Malden (Van Johnson), who has a neurotic aversion to alcohol. The slightest sip of the
    stuff triggers truly bizarre behavior. This resulted from his almost drowning in a
    cellar-full of brandy during the war. In this respect, Malden is like a recovering
    alcoholic who is always just one drink away from falling back into the gutter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Malden is first in his law school class and thus gets hired at a
    silk-stocking law firm. Elizabeth Taylor (in a role she'd probably rather forget) is the
    senior partner's daughter; she falls in love with Malden and tries to help him deal with
    his alcohol problem. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Like many otherwise mediocre films about law, <em>The Big Hangover</em>
    has some interesting bits. One concerns a Chinese doctor who has been denied an apartment
    on racial grounds. The City Attorney is trying to force the owner to let him move in. I
    was surprised to learn that there were any housing anti-discrimination laws or ordinances
    back in 1951. Such an ordinance was a huge political issue in Berkeley in 1964.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Of course the apartment owner is a client of Malden's firm. The
    idealistic young lawyer is horrified to see the dirty tricks the senior partners play to
    thwart the City Attorney and keep the doctor out of the apartment. Like many heroic film
    lawyers, Malden betrays his client (the apartment owner) for a greater good (getting the
    doctor into the apartment). The audience loves it, but lawyers cringe at the violation of
    ethical canons demanding loyalty to the client. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><em>The Big Hangover</em> has some quaint material about how law
    students got jobs back then. You signed up on a clipboard in the hallway, giving your name
    and your class ranking! Today, of course, most law schools have abandoned class rankings
    entirely; if rankings exist at all, their secrecy is carefully guarded. </font></p>
