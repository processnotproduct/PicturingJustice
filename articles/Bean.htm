    <td valign="top"><h1><font face="Verdana">The Bumbler as Anarchist</font></h1>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><em><strong>by John Denvir, USF Law School</strong> </em>(December
    1997)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">We have been having some discussions in the <i>PJ </i>editorial
    offices about whether <i>Bean </i>qualifies as a &quot;law&quot; movie. My position is
    that it all depends what you mean by &quot;law.&quot; If you (a la H. L. A. Hart) limit
    the term to rules enforced by the courts, <i>Bean</i> doesn&#146;t qualify since there is
    little in the movie about statutes or trials. But if you include within the term
    &quot;laws&quot; all the socially enforced rules and conventions which actually determine
    the quality of our lives, <i>Bean</i> is clearly a &quot;law&quot; movie&#151; more
    accurately an &quot;anti-law&quot; movie. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The plot of the film <i>Bean</i> is easy to relate. Bean is
    employed at the National Gallery of Art in London as one of those people who sit in the
    museum all day to make sure no one cops a painting. As a joke (those Brits!), the head of
    the gallery decides to send Bean to be the National Gallery&#146;s representative at the
    unveiling at an aspiring Los Angeles gallery of the newly purchased portrait of
    Whistler&#146;s Mother. Although Bean (Rowan Atkinson) knows nothing about any art other
    than tossing jelly beans high in the air and then catching him in his mouth, the culture
    hungry Americans accept him as an expert. He then proceeds to destroy the unveiling and
    much else.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Bean is an attractive character on three scores. First, there is
    the juvenile in all of us. The movie glories in jokes about diarrhea and mucous, the type
    thing which eight year olds (of all ages) find hilarious. Secondly, Bean represents the
    bumbler deep down inside each of us, the little man or woman who passes from <i>faux pas</i>
    to <i>faux pas</i> without missing a beat. Here is one example. Just before the first
    meeting with the American gallery&#146;s director, Bean stops off at the men&#146;s room
    where he manages to splash water all over his pants. In order to avoid the embarrassment
    of people thinking he has wet his pants, Bean attempts to dry the pants by gyrating in
    front of the hand dryer. Suddenly, he notices his rather obscene dance is being witnessed
    by a gallery employee so Bean pretends he is examining a hot light bulb until the employee
    leaves and he can yelp in pain. I&#146;m sure you have had similar days.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But most of all, Bean is a closet anarchist. His supposed
    inability to follow the ordinary rules of &quot;normal&quot; life turns out to be an act
    of will, a micro-revolutionary act. He doesn&#146;t conform to the expectations of our
    bureaucratic public culture because it&#146;s just too bloody boring. We see this when
    Bean is brought to an American Disney-type amusement park where he rides the &quot;Ride of
    Doom,&quot; a dumbed down &quot;scary&quot; ride. All the passengers are happily
    moderately frightened by the experience, but Bean is bored. He asks to ride again, this
    time surreptitiously &quot;souping up&quot; the computer which drives the ride. As his
    fellow passenger faint of fear as they are thrashed back, forth, and out of their seats,
    Bean is sublimely content. This is finally fun.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Bean rejects the &quot;real&quot; world in favor of the world of
    imagination. For Bean &quot;gunplay&quot; is literally that&#151; playing with an
    imaginary gun. He soon finds out that for the heavily armed LAPD, guns, like everything
    else, are a grim business. It&#146;s not easy being imaginative in L.A. where fantasy is
    big business. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The key interaction in the film is between Bean and David Langley
    (Peter MacNichol), the gallery curator. Langley thinks he lives for art, but he actually
    is just one more middle level bureaucrat who could just as easily be found in a law or
    accounting firm. Like everyone else he judges the value of art by its cost; <i>Whistler&#146;s
    Mother</i> must be great art&#151;it cost sixty million dollars. When he is not being
    intimidated by his boss, he is engaged in endless negotiations with his wife and two
    teenage kids in what seems more like a joint venture than a family. He is so busy trying
    to please everyone that he pleases no one, especially himself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Enter Bean. Bean soon solves David&#146;s problem by various
    exploits which result in David effectively losing his job and his family. This being
    California, he probably will also end up the defendant in a lawsuit. With nothing left to
    lose, Bean and David go out to get drunk, and they succeed. On the way home, they sing a
    boozy duet of the old Beatles ballad &quot;Yesterday.&quot; The lyrics are sad, but the
    singers are not. For the first time in the film David seems happy. He has nothing to live
    for, except the fun of living. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Of course, <i>Bean</i> is a Hollywood film, and a
    &quot;family&quot; comedy at that, so David cannot be left free. Therefore, by a series of
    improbable but amusing stunts, Bean is able to save the day and at the film&#146;s end
    David regains his job and his family. Bean even gives a little speech about the importance
    of &quot;family.&quot; The audience has its obligatory &quot;happy ending.&quot; But for
    this viewer, the nagging question remains, &quot;Will David ever forgive him?&quot;</font></p>
