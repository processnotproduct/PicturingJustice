    <i><p><strong><font face="Verdana">by Elisabeth Friedman, Western Michigan University </font></strong></i>(November
    1997)<p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Four friends plot a robbery for Robin-hood reasons. A sports
    utility vehicle drives through one side of a bank and out the other, splintering plate
    glass as it goes. A poor, beautiful girl is swept off her feet by a handsome, wealthy man.
    A fleet of police cars and helicopters chase a fleeing suspect's car through downtown
    L.A., finally cornering it in a hail of bullets. An unsympathetic cop learns a lesson.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">This may sound like a recipe for a Hollywood hit, but F. Gary
    Gray's largely passed-over <i>Set It Off</i> slipped quietly from the screen into the
    Blockbuster &quot;New Releases&quot; section. And in this reviewer's opinion,
    undeservedly. Despite all its seemingly cliched plot twists, this movie is an original: it
    puts African American women squarely front and center. In doing so, it neither has them
    waiting to exhale nor cooking soul food, but bringing to life tragic heroines of
    all-too-real modern times. And they get to drive stolen cars and shoot submachine guns
    too.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">It's not that this story isn't told pretty much according to
    formula. The motivation for the characters is clearly laid out, acted upon, and earns the
    expected results. But in setting the stage for the four friends<big>&#151;</big>Frankie
    (Vivica A. Fox), Cleo (Queen Latifah), Stoney (Jada Pinkett), and T-T (Kimberly Elise)<big>&#151;</big>to
    form a bank-robbing gang, Gray draws from inner city, black, female experience. When
    Frankie justifies their turn to crime by declaring &quot;We just takin' away from the
    system<big>&#151;</big>that's fucking us all anyway&quot; the viewer knows what is going
    down. In previous scenes, black and white bosses alike have used sexism, racism, and
    homophobia to cheat the four out of jobs and money. The police have descended on their
    neighborhood in SWAT teams and shot their innocent family members; stern child protection
    workers have taken their kids away from them because they can't afford childcare.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Driven to extremes, the friends remain amateur thieves at best,
    and greed soon rends solidarity. But friendship proves the lasting bond. Although they
    have different ideas what their money should be spent on<big>&#151;</big>cars and women,
    an escape hatch, making the same life a little more bearable<big>&#151;</big>these women
    are there for each other until the bitter end. Even the white cop who obsessively tracks
    them down seems to finally get, in the midst of the mayhem, what the friends are up
    against.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Of course, a romantic subplot is used to move the story along; it
    sticks out as the least believable element of a fairly realistic situation. Stoney takes
    up with a bank manager<big>&#151;</big>an African-American Harvard Business School grad,
    no less<big>&#151;</big>who only wants to make her dinner and make love to her. Don't get
    me wrong<big>&#151;</big>it's a nice fantasy, but clearly is just that.</font></p>
    <i><p></i><font face="Verdana">The film <i>Set It Off</i> could be considered a black <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Thelma+%26+Louise+(1991)"><i>Thelma and Louise</i></a>
    (with a twist on the no-way-out ending), or a female <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Boyz+N+the+Hood+(1991)"><i>Boyz N The Hood</i></a>.
    Except that in focusing on elements of African American women's experience, it reveals a
    less-explored set of issues which are finally making it onto the big screen. So why
    haven't you heard of it? Good question.</font></p>
