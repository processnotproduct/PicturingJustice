    <td valign="top"><h1>Lynch Mobs in Trial Movies</h1>
    <p><em><font face="Verdana"><strong>by Michael Asimow, UCLA Law School</strong> (December
    1997)</font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">This Golden Oldie commentary features that good old American
    staple&#151;the lynch mob. Lynch mobs were a very real part of the American
    &quot;justice&quot; system for many decades, and they make for powerful cinema. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One of the most terrifying lynch mob films of all time is <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Fury+(1936)"><i>Fury</i></a> (193<font face="Verdana">6</font>), directed by the great Fritz Lang and starring Spencer Tracy.
    Another classic lynch mob scene appears in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Young+Mr%2E+Lincoln+(1939)"><i>Young Mr. Lincoln</i></a>
    (1939), directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda. Both films are available on video.
    If your local store doesn't have them, you can rent or buy them from <a href="http://www.reel.com">reel.com</a>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In <i>Fury</i>, Tracy plays Joe Wilson, an ordinary guy who drives
    into Strand and is arrested on suspicion of kidnaping&#151;a crime of which he's
    completely innocent. Word gets 'round town, however, and a lynch mob forms. The mob burns
    the jail to the ground with Wilson inside. The governor doesn't call in the militia for
    fear of further inflaming the situation. The lynching is premiere entertainment for the
    townsfolk. It's covered by newsreel photographers. We see mothers holding up their babies
    to get a better look and various yokels munching on hot dogs as they enjoy the
    festivities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Unknown to everyone, however, Wilson escapes from jail during the
    attack. He craves revenge and gets his brothers to persuade Strand's DA to prosecute the
    mob for murder. The fact that a prosecution occurred is, of course, quite unusual. The
    vast majority of lynchings were never prosecuted&#151;and probably juries would have
    refused to convict if they were. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The trial features a pioneering use of visual aids&#151;the
    newsreel footage of the mob leaders. Unlike most murder victims, Wilson gets to enjoy the
    proceedings which are broadcast live on the radio. The trial is absolutely riveting, but
    you'll have to see the film to find out how this ingenious plot is resolved. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Lang fled Nazi Germany shortly before making <i>Fury</i> and the
    scary mob violence in the film surely echoes his experiences. The sheriff blames strangers
    from out of town for the lynching, for example, which sounds quite a bit like Hitler
    blaming the Jews for Germany's troubles. The actual story of <i>Fury</i> is said to be
    inspired by a lynching that took place in San Jose, California, in 1933. A mob dragged two
    suspects from the jail and hanged them in the town square as newsreel cameras turned. The
    governor of California refused to call in the militia and announced that the lynching was
    a wonderful lesson for the whole country. Unlike <i>Fury</i>, nobody was ever prosecuted.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In the inspiring <i>Young Mr. Lincoln</i>, a lynch mob forms to
    kill a couple of brothers who are suspected of murdering a man at a county fair.&nbsp; A
    tall stranger emerges to advise the mother of the two men. &quot;Who are you,&quot; she
    asks? &quot;I'm your lawyer, ma'am&quot; replies Lincoln. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In a wonderfully cinematic but not very realistic scene, Lincoln
    stands at the jailhouse door and jollies the mob into going home. Later he defends the
    brothers in a terrific frontier-type trial. In a nifty bit of Perry Mason-type cross-
    examination, Lincoln gets the real killer to confess. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Lynch mobs have appeared in numerous other trial films. Of those
    available for rental, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?To+Kill+a+Mockingbird+(1962)"><i>To Kill a
    Mockingbird</i></a> (1962) and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Ox-Bow+Incident%2C+The+(1943)"><i>The Oxbow
    Incident</i></a> (1943) come to mind. Even better lynch mob scenes appear in two
    fascinating trial films which unfortunately have yet to be released on video--<a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?They+Won%27t+Forget+(1937)"><i>They Won't Forget</i></a>
    (1937) and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Trial+(1955)"><i>Trial</i></a>
    (1955). <i>They Won't Forget</i> is modeled on the Leo Frank case, in which a Jewish man
    who moved to the south was convicted (probably wrongly) of murder, dragged off a train,
    and lynched. In the film, however, the mob is crazed by anti-Yankee rather than
    anti-Semitic sentiment. <i>Trial</i> is a wonderful relic of the McCarthy era which could
    have been scripted by J. Edgar Hoover. It includes an excellent lynching scene directed at
    a Hispanic youngster being held in jail on suspicion of raping a white woman. Try to catch
    these two on cable.</font></p>
