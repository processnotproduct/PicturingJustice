    Nuremberg</h1>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><em><strong>By Michael Asimow, UCLA Law School </strong></em>(August
    1998)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Stanley Kramer&#146;s masterpiece <i>Judgment at Nuremberg</i>
    (1961) stands alone as the finest film about judges ever made. In the film, four Nazi
    judges are placed on trial at Nuremberg before a panel of three American judges. Three of
    the German judges are Nazi thugs but one of them, Ernst Janning (played by Burt
    Lancaster), was quite different. Janning had been a famous and aristocratic legal scholar,
    a drafter of the Weimar constitution, and a man who detested Hitler and the Nazis. Yet he
    remained on the bench under the Third Reich. All defendants are convicted and sentenced to
    life imprisonment. The chief American judge, Dan Haywood (played memorably by Spencer
    Tracy), brushes aside the various excuses offered by defense counsel Rolfe (a role for
    which Maximilian Schell won an Oscar).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The Nuremberg war crime trials presented many thorny
    jurisprudential issues, such as the problem of ex post facto criminal law and the issue of
    how the court obtained jurisdiction over the defendants. In particular, what justification
    is there for an international (rather than a German) tribunal to try a case in which the
    offenses were committed by Germans against other Germans? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But the trial of the Nazi judges presented additional dilemmas.
    What of Rolfe&#146;s argument that Janning remained on the bench in order to make the
    system of justice more merciful than it otherwise would have been? Certainly if Janning
    had resigned he would have been replaced by a more brutal official. Should this be a
    defense against charges that in some cases Janning had acted in a brutal and lawless
    manner? And what of positivism&#151;is it not the responsibility of the judge to carry out
    the laws of his country adopted by competent authorities, even if he disagrees with them?
    And what of independence&#151;can a person serve as a judge when he is subject to the
    control or influence of non-judicial officials? And how about selective
    prosecution&#151;there were thousands of German judges. Why are these four being picked
    on? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Judicial independence was an issue for the American judges at
    Nuremberg as well. By the time of the trial, Haywood was under intense pressure to go easy
    on the defendants since the Cold War had begun. The Berlin Blockade was underway and
    higher concerns of foreign policy suggested that the Germans were now allies rather than
    enemies. In the film, Haywood resists these pressures and finds the defendants guilty
    based on a few cases they had judged. A judge&#146;s responsibility, he declares, is to
    stand for justice hen standing for something is most difficult. At a recent talk I gave to
    a roomful of judges, the audience burst into spontaneous applause after hearing
    Haywood&#146;s judgment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Judgment at Nuremberg is based on the third Nuremberg trial (there
    were a total of thirteen) . Charges were brought against sixteen functionaries in the
    legal system&#151;judges, prosecutors, and officials of the Ministry of Justice. They were
    by no means the worst offenders in the Nazi justice system, but the worst offenders were
    dead. Janning is a conglomeration of several actual defendants, including Franz
    Schlegelberger who was formerly undersecretary in the Ministry of Justice. Schlegelberger
    offered the defense that if he were to resign, a worse man would take his place. The Court
    thought there was much truth in this but convicted him anyway.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The key evidence against Janning was the Feldenstein case.
    Feldenstein was an elderly Jew convicted under the Law for the Protection of German Blood
    and German Honor for having sex with Irene Hoffman, a much younger Aryan woman (played by
    Judy Garland). Janning was the judge and he sentenced Feldenstein to death. At the
    Nuremberg trial, Janning conceded that he had decided to condemn Feldenstein even before
    the trial began, regardless of what the evidence would show. However, like everything else
    in the movie, the Feldenstein case presents serious issues. There was solid evidence
    presented at the trial that Feldenstein and Hoffman had a sexual relationship, even though
    they denied it and Hoffman continued to deny it at Nuremberg. Given that evidence, is it
    right to say that Janning&#146;s decision to find Feldenstein guilty was itself a war
    crime?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><i>Hitler&#146;s Justice </i>is a devastatingly well-documented
    book on the Nazi legal system by Ingo Muller. Written in 1991, this book discusses the
    entire legal system under the Nazis&#151;lawyers, Bar Associations, law professors,
    judges, and prosecutors. Speaking of judges, Muller (at pp. 193-95) finds one judge&#151;<i>just
    one&#151;</i>who opposed the Nazis and spoke up against the prostitution of the judicial
    system. This judge, Lothar Kreyssig, was allowed to retire in 1942 and received a full
    pension. This suggests that other judges could have resisted the Nazis&#151;if they had
    wanted to. Muller also discusses the Nuremberg trial and domestic German trials against
    some of the judges&#151;and recounts how all of them, judges and professors alike, were
    swiftly rehabilitated and got their jobs back. They then wrote many books and articles
    justifying their actions under the Third Reich.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Muller describes a case exactly like the Feldenstein affair (at
    pp. 113-15). It was the notorious Katzenberger case which was decided in 1942 by Oswald
    Rothaug, himself a Nuremberg defendant. Katzenberger was 67 years old, a pillar of
    Nuremberg&#146;s Jewish community. He rented an apartment to Irene Seiler, who was thirty
    years old. The two were clearly good friends but they strongly denied any sexual
    relationship. As described by Muller, the evidence that a sexual relationship actually
    existed was much weaker in the Katzenberger case than in the fictionalized Feldenstein
    version presented in the film.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Muller has an extensive and horrifying chapter (Chapter 12) on the
    German blood protection statute. He shows how court decisions aggressively broadened the
    coverage of the law, both in defining who was a Jew and who was an Aryan, and in
    describing the circumstances that would violate the law. The judges and prosecutors
    enthusiastically enforced the law with the utmost brutality and the broadest possible
    coverage. The law covered considerably more than sexual contact; it also criminalized
    &quot;dishonor to the race&quot; which included kissing and even, in one extreme case,
    staring at an Aryan woman as she walked by on the other side of the street. While the
    blood protection law called for prison sentences rather than capital punishment, a
    violation of that law could be combined with other laws (such as the Habitual Criminal Law
    or the Decree on Asocial Elements) to produce the death penalty, as occurred in the
    Katzenberger case.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Another of Muller&#146;s chapters (chapter 9), which I found
    particularly disheartening, concerned the role of law professors under the Third Reich.
    All Jewish and Social Democratic law professors were quickly purged in 1933. This
    eliminated 120 of the 378 professors then working. The remaining professors tended to be
    extremely conservative. Younger men with the proper Nazi party credentials filled the
    openings. All of these professors (young and old) vied in writing books and articles that
    would be pleasing to the Nazis. They glorified Hitler, praised law by decree, vilified the
    ideas of constitutionalism and judicial independence, and called for ever-more brutal
    applications of Nazi laws and decrees. As Muller rightly puts it, all this scholarship
    &quot;managed to disguise only with difficulty the fact that all of these [theories] meant
    turning back the clock and eradicating every trace of civilization and historical progress
    from German law.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The questions raised by <i>Judgment at Nuremberg</i> go to the
    core of what we do and what we are. What does it mean to be a lawyer, professor, or judge?
    Do we believe in positivism, natural law, legal realism? What do those philosophies
    require when one is a participant in the Nazi legal system? What if many judges had
    resisted the Nazis instead of pandering to them? Could the Holocaust have been prevented?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">When should we follow the law and when should we resist it or
    twist it? When must a judge resign rather than carry out an immoral law? How about laws
    that require a life sentence for stealing a box of Pampers (like California&#146;s
    three-strike law) or decades in prison for trivial drug offenses (like the federal law on
    crack cocaine)&#151;are these as wicked and illegitimate as the German blood protection
    law? Every judge, lawyer, law student and law professor should see <i>Judgment at
    Nuremberg</i>. If you saw it years ago, see it again.</font></p>
