    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;by John Denvir</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Let&#146;s face it&#150; lawyers don&#146;t get much good
    press, especially in movies. I don&#146;t mean just &quot;negative&quot; portrayals of
    lawyers like Al Pacino as a lawyer Satan in &quot;The Devil&#146;s Advocate&quot; or the
    whiny lawyer in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; who becomes (to the audience&#146;s delight)
    dinosaur snack food. Even supposedly &quot;positive&quot; images of lawyers in film turn
    out to be hollow. For instance, Atticus Finch ( Gregoryl Peck) in &quot;to Kill a
    Mockingbird&quot; is a great dad, but the fact of the matter is that his innocent client
    is convicted. Atticus is a noble loser, but still a loser. And when a lawyer does
    successfully defend a client, like Polly Biegler (James Stewart) in &quot;Anatomy of a
    Murder,&quot; it turns out that the client is guilty as sin.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I think the concept of the &quot;trickster&quot; can help
    solve this &quot;image&quot; problem for lawyers, showing our profession in a new and more
    favorable light. I take the concept of &quot;trickster&quot; from Lewis Hyde&#146;s
    important book <i>Trickster Makes This World.</i> Hyde is not talking about lawyers. His
    interest is in mythic characters like Hermes of Greek mythology and Coyote of Native
    American stories, but he also believes that the &quot;trickster&quot; role is one
    necessary to all societies which hope to adapt to change. That&#146;s where I think
    lawyers come in. Hyde mentions three characteristics of the &quot;trickster&quot; which I
    think might help us understand the social of role of lawyers First, Tricksters are always
    found at the &quot;borders&quot; of culture; outsiders who grease the transition from one
    form of culture to another. They are creatures of change rather than stasis. Secondly,
    tricksters are &quot;polytropic;&quot; this means that they are capable of taking on a
    multitude of roles, not blessed or cursed with one strong core persona. Finally,
    tricksters deal in lies, but lies which reveal a larger truth. (note: to read more about
    &quot;tricksters&quot;, check out John Denvir's article &quot;<a href="test/tricksters.htm">Tricksters</a>&quot;) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I would like to use John Ford&#146;s classic Western,
    &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot;, to<img src="images/liberty.JPG" alt="liberty.JPG (37665 bytes)" align="right" hspace="12" vspace="12" width="144" height="267"> show how the
    &quot;trickster&quot; motif might change our view of lawyers. Let&#146;s first review the
    plot without reference to the &quot;trickster.&quot; Then we&#146;ll see how our
    perception of the lawyer changes when we see him as a trickster. The story revolves around
    the experiences of tenderfoot lawyer Ransom Stoddard ( James Stewart) who goes West to set
    up a practice in the town of Shinbone. The stage he is riding is held up by bad man
    Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) who whips Stoddard, leaving him close to death. Stoddard is
    found by small rancher Tom Doniphon ( John Wayne) who brings him to town to be cared for
    by Doniphon&#146;s sweetheart Hallie (Vera Miles) and her family. Stoddard&#146;s arrival
    has two important effects. One, he starts to unwittingly undermine Doniphon&#146;s
    relationship to Hallie by introducing her to the charms of civilization. For instance,
    when Doniphon gives her a cactus rose, Stoddard innocently asks, &quot; Have you ever seen
    a real rose, Hallie?&quot; Secondly, he starts to educate the town on the principles of
    democracy, a hot topic since there is about to be a territorial convention about whether
    to seek statehood. Stoddard&#146;s pro-democracy activities bring him into conflict again
    with Liberty Valance, a hired gun for the big ranchers who oppose statehood. Valance
    challenges Stoddard to a gunfight everyone knows will end in Stoddard&#146;s death, but
    miraculously Ranse kills the gunslinger. His fame as &quot;the man who shot Liberty
    Valance&quot; results in a successful political career with Hallie as his wife. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The only problem is that there was no &quot;miracle.&quot;
    Stoddard didn&#146;t &quot;outdraw&quot; Valance; a hidden Tom Doniphon bushwhacked him at
    the plea of Hallie to save Stoddard&#146;s life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This turn of events does not reflect well either on
    Stoddard the lawyer or law in general. Stoddard is personally living a lie, underscoring
    our profession&#146;s reputation for deceit. Also, law is shown, despite its pretensions
    to be the embodiment of reason, to be dependent in the final analysis on violence since it
    was Doniphon&#146;s gun, not Stoddard&#146;s law books which brought &quot;law and
    order&quot; to Shinbone. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">How can the &quot;trickster&quot; image reformulate this
    view of law land lawyers. Certainly Ranse Stoddard possesses some &quot;Trickster&quot;
    traits. For instance, he is clearly the &quot;outsider&quot; who becomes the agent of
    change in Shinbone. You might say that Shinbone society is in a state of stasis which is
    comprised of a standoff between the forces of &quot;lawless violence&quot; represented by
    Liberty Valance and the forces of &quot;righteous violence&quot; represented by Tom
    Doniphon. The movie well illustrates this face-off in the scene where Ranse Stoddard,
    working in a restaurant, tries to serve a steak to Tom Doniphon. Liberty trips him,
    sending the steak to the floor. Doniphon tells Valance &quot;That was my steak,
    Liberty.&quot; Valance replies to Stoddard, &quot;You heard him, Dude, pick it up.&quot;
    Doniphon&#146;s rejoinder is &quot; No, Liberty, you pick it up.&quot; The screen is
    filled with the potential for violence until Stoddard intervenes by picking up the steak
    himself. &quot; Are you two crazy? Willing to kill each other over a lousy steak. Well,
    it&#146;s picked up.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But neither Valance or Doniphon is &quot;crazy&quot; within
    the moral context of the old Shinbone. If there&#146;s a dispute, as Doniphon is always
    reminding Ranse, it&#146;s settled by a six gun. Valance and Stoddard share a disdain for
    law. Stoddard, on the other hand, is the lawyer, the man of law. He is the agent of change
    who by the end of the film has brought both law and the railroad to Shinbone. He is the
    outsider at the beginning film who arrives beaten and broke, but he ends the film as the
    esteemed Senator who has turned the Fordian wilderness into a garden.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We can also see Stoddard as &quot;polytropic.&quot; Maybe
    not wily, but certainly he is capable of playing a multitude of social roles. Stoddard
    changes persona from scene to scene. First, he&#146;s the neophyte lawyer, then a
    dishwasher and waiter in the local eatery, then cub <img src="images/duke.JPG" alt="duke.JPG (12234 bytes)" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="136" height="219">reporter, and schoolmaster. Finally, he
    trains himself (not too successfully) to be a gunfighter, and even engages in a fist fight
    with Doniphon. Later he evolves into a caricature of a slick politician before hinting at
    the end of the film that he might like to be a small town lawyer again. Liberty Valance
    and Tom Doniphon can only be themselves. Liberty is the quintessential sociopathic Western
    gunslinger, living only to inflict and absorb violence. Doniphon is , well, John Wayne,
    the laconic, deadly Western hero. Neither can adapt to the new Shinbone, and therefore
    both die. It&#146;s Stoddard&#146;s ability to adapt to the necessities of change which
    allows him to prevail.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, Stoddard also fulfills the third trickster&quot;
    requirement of dealing in lies, but lies which turn out to be true. Stoddard is not your
    typical &quot;trickster&quot; like Brer Rabbit or Tom Sawyer, amoralists who enjoy playing
    with the truth. In fact, if anything, Stoddard is too &quot;honest.&quot; Ford makes him
    annoyingly moralistic, even correcting Hallie on her grammar. But the crucial fact upon
    which the plot revolves is that Stoddard is involved in a lie. The lie, of course, is that
    Ransom Stoddard is the &quot;man who shot Liberty Valance.&quot; Once Doniphon tells him
    the truth of the matter, all his public acts become deceitful because his political
    success is based on a lie; the voters think he killed Liberty Valance, but actually
    Doniphon did. Yet by the end the of film this &quot;lie&#146; turns into a larger
    &quot;truth.&quot; Maybe Ranse didn&#146;t kill Liberty Valance the man, but Valance was
    more than just a man, he was the a symbol for a whole social structure. In this sense, by
    bringing law, democracy (and the railroad) to Shinbone, Ransom Stoddard very much is the
    man who shot (and killed ) Liberty Valance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There&#146;s a darker side to Ranse Stoddard which I will
    save for another time. For now, let&#146;s appreciate him as a good example of the
    lawyer&#146;s larger social role, one in which we can take pride as lawyers. Lawyers are
    the appointed agents of change in American society; they perform this necessary social
    function because they have the imagination to see a possible future and the skill and
    tenacity to make that vision a reality. And even the lawyer&#146;s loose way with the
    &quot;truth&quot; is necessary if he or she is going to help society rethink its
    conventional wisdom in the process of creating new social values And sometimes the lawyer
    even gets the girl. </font></p>
