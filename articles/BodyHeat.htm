    <font face="Verdana"><p><em><strong>By Michael Asimow, UCLA Law School</strong> </em>(January
    1998)</p>
    <p>The neo-noir <i>Body Heat</i> (MGM 1981) has a captivatingly cynical plot, pleasingly
    reminiscent of the immortal <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Double+Indemnity+(1944)"><i>Double Indemnity</i></a>.
    The witty dialogue, photography, Lawrence Kasdan's direction, music, and acting are all
    superb. Florida sizzles, and apparently nothing is air conditioned. Kathleen Turner is a
    deliciously erotic Matty Walker. But our focus here is on William Hurt's role as lawyer
    Ned Racine.</p>
    <p><i>Body Heat</i> presents a fully realized version of a particular kind of lawyer<big>&#151;</big>the
    kind the profession can easily get along without. A graduate of Florida State's law
    school, Ned isn't likely to be named FSU alum of the year. He's the sort of small-time
    lawyer who tends to get into a lot of trouble. </p>
    <p>Ned isn't too smart (as Matty says &quot;I like that in a man&quot;). He's pretty
    incompetent. (He was successfully sued for malpractice a couple of years ago.) He doesn't
    seem to care about his clients. He really doesn't like being a lawyer much, he remarks at
    dinner. Judges and other lawyers don't respect him<big>&#151;</big>and with good reason.
    He drinks too much. He jogs faithfully, but lights up a cigarette when he's through. He
    plays around with loose women. Worst of all, Ned's a little weak in the ethical
    department. He takes up with Matty, knowing that she is married. And before long, Matty
    manipulates Ned into killing her husband Edmund to get a hold of his money. </p>
    <p>The character of Ned Racine is discussed in greater detail in an article by John
    Burkoff, <em>If God Wanted Lawyers to Fly, She Would have Given Them Wings: Life, Lust
    &amp; Legal Ethics in</em> Body Heat<i>,</i> 22 Okla. City U. L. Rev. 187 (1997) (an
    excellent law and film symposium by the way). </p>
    <p>Only law and film nerds would care much about the estate planning aspects of <i>Body
    Heat</i><big>&#151;</big>but therein hangs an interesting tale. Not to give away too much,
    a key plot element concerns Edmund Walker's wills. Edmund's first will left half of his
    estate to Matty, half in trust for his young niece Heather. But Matty is a bottom-line
    type of person; she wants to do away with Edmund and get all of his money, not just half.
    So she steals some of Racine's stationery and drafts a new will, forging the necessary
    signatures. </p>
    <p>Like Edmund's first will, the phony second will divides the loot 50-50 between Matty
    and Heather, but the bequest to Heather in the second will is deliberately drafted so as
    to violate the rule against perpetuities. As a result the bequest to Heather in the second
    will is invalid. Since Matty is the sole intestate heir, she takes the entire estate. </p>
    <p>But what was the perpetuities problem in the second will? We're not told exactly, but
    presumably the trust for Heather included a contingent remainder, where the contingency
    could not vest during the period of lives-in-being-plus-21-years. Under the traditional
    version of the rule against perpetuities, the presence of such a contingency (however
    unlikely to materialize) invalidates the gift (unless the will contained a &quot;savings
    clause&quot; which obviously it didn't).&nbsp; [<a href="http://www.wwlia.org/ruleperp.htm">Click here for more information about the Rule
    Against Perpetuities.</a>]</p>
    <p>Trouble is, before the film was shot, Florida had abolished this form of the rule
    against perpetuities. Instead it took a wait-and-see approach, under which the gift
    remains valid unless and until the interest actually fails to vest within the perpetuities
    period. Thus under the Florida rule, the second will was entirely valid and Heather gets
    half. How could the film makers have made such an error? </p>
    <p>My colleague, perpetuities guru Jesse Dukeminier, tracked down the technical adviser to
    the movie. It seems that the film was originally set in New Jersey which at the time
    followed the traditional rule against perpetuities. Because of a Teamster's strike in the
    New York-New Jersey area, the movie was moved to Florida and the story rewritten to occur
    there. But nobody took into account that Florida's rule is different from New Jersey's. </p>
    <p>Moreover, as Jesse points out, even if Edmund's second will was partially invalid
    because of the perpetuities problem, the doctrine of dependent relative revocation should
    have applied. Under this doctrine, a will revocation is conditional. If a second will
    proves to be invalid, it's assumed the testator would want the first one to remain in
    effect if doing so would more closely carry out the testator's intent than would
    intestacy. Since it is obvious that Edmund intended to benefit Heather (she got half under
    both wills), the doctrine should have applied and the bequest to Heather under the first
    will should have remained in effect. As a result, Heather should have gotten half of
    Edmund's estate. The technical adviser missed this issue entirely.</font><p>
