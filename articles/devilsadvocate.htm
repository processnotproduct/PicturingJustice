    <p align="JUSTIFY"><em><strong><font face="Verdana">by Steve Greenfield and Guy Osborn,
    Centre for the Study of Law, Society and Popular Culture, University of Westminster </font></strong></em>(March
    1998)</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">The disdain that contemporary American society
    seems to reserve for the legal profession (whilst at the same time embracing the potential
    benefits litigation can bring) is epitomised by the fashion of anti-lawyer jokes. This
    love/hate relationship has not however been reflected within legal films which have
    generally adopted a perspective of lawyers as right thinking and often conscience driven.
    This is classically represented in older films such as <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?To+Kill+a+Mockingbird+(1962)"><i>To Kill a
    Mockingbird</i></a>, but is also evidenced in more recent examples such as <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Suspect+(1987)"><i>Suspect</i></a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?In+the+Name+of+the+Father+(1993)"><i>In the Name of the
    Father</i></a>. Notwithstanding the penchant for these rose tinted representations, a more
    &#145;realistic&#146; portrayal has emerged within some films such as <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Philadelphia+(1993)"><i>Philadelphia</i></a> which
    demonstrated that lawyers were not beyond cynical prejudice, indeed it even managed to
    incorporate one of the &quot;jokes&quot; referred to above. Even within the
    &#145;realism&#146; of <i>Philadelphia</i> we still see a transformation with Denzel
    Washington&#146;s character confronting his homophobia during the film and becoming a
    better person for it; perhaps the most extreme example of this transformation is <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Regarding+Henry+(1991)"><i>Regarding Henry</i></a>
    where it requires a bullet wound to the head to for the lawyer to move from selfishness to
    compassion, or perhaps more accurately from being tinged with &#145;evil&#146; to
    embracing the &#145;good&#146;. </font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">This mixture of the conscience driven lawyer
    coupled with the greedy power hungry figure is neatly combined in the recently released <i>The
    Devil&#146;s Advocate</i> (Taylor Hackford, 1997). The film draws upon a litany of sources
    from Dante&#146;s <i>Inferno </i>to Milton&#146;s <i>Paradise Lost</i> (Al Pacino&#146;s
    role is tellingly as lawyer John Milton), the film has more recent echoes in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Wall+Street+(1987)"><i>Wall Street</i></a>, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Bonfire+of+the+Vanities,+The+(1990)"><i>The Bonfire of the
    Vanities</i></a> and in its broadest sense <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Witches+of+Eastwick,+The+(1987)"><i>The Witches of Eastwick</i></a>.
    The film in particular raises a number of interesting issues regarding the moral dilemmas
    facing the individual lawyer within the legal system, the place of ethics within the legal
    pantheon and the wider dimension of the relationship between law, lawyers and society.
    Interestingly <i>The Devil&#146;s Advocate</i> taps into a line of film making that does
    sees the law and the &#145;lawgiver&#146; as somewhat deified, John Ford&#146;s <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Young+Mr%2E+Lincoln+(1939)"><i>Young Mr. Lincoln</i></a>
    for example eloquently tapped into the myth of Abraham Lincoln and further canonised the
    character within it, even Henry Fonda initially baulked at playing such a role as he felt
    it would be tantamount to playing god! <i>The Devil&#146;s Advocate</i> inverts this theme
    and shows the law as a representation of the &#145;dark side&#146;, as a vehicle of evil
    rather than good.</font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">The representation of the lawyer as the devil is
    not an entirely new one&#151;perhaps most recently <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?J%E9sus+de+Montr%E9al+(1989)"><i>Jesus of Montreal</i></a>
    showed a cameo of the lawyer offering a Faustian pact to the quasi Jesus figure. <i>The
    Devil&#146;s Advocate</i> begins with Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) defending a client he
    concludes to be guilty in a Florida courtroom, after a minor crisis of confidence he
    retires to the bathroom before resolving to carry on with his defence regardless&#151;he
    is after all undefeated in all his trials and his vanity is more important that what might
    be deemed &#145;right&#146;. He naturally wins the case and is soon head hunted by a
    powerful New York firm commanded by the irrepressible John Milton (Al Pacino) and
    relocates with his wife to Manhattan. It is clear that Lomax is good at what he does, but
    unnaturally so with an unerring ability to make the right decisions. Lomax&#146;s career
    blossoms, winning a number of well constructed court cases, whilst his relationship with
    his wife begins to fall apart. Milton offers him the chance to drop the important case he
    is handling in order to help his wife who by now is descending rapidly into a (Milton
    induced) mental illness but again Lomax&#146;s vanity wins out. His wife later commits
    suicide in a psychiatric unit after she alleges that Milton raped her and it is revealed
    that Milton is in fact Lomax&#146;s father. The film reaches its denouement when Lomax
    goes to confront his father in his penthouse lair. His father offers Lomax anything he
    wants in return for him agreeing to father the Antichrist and Lomax begins to negotiate,
    his slick lawyers penchant seemingly working overtime. In reply to his question of why the
    law was chosen for his satanic &#145;front&#146;, Milton replies that the law is &#145;the
    new priesthood&#146; and &#145;the ultimate backstage pass&#146;; that law is the
    embodiment of evil. Seeing his strong bargaining position, that while the satanic Milton
    can offer anything he<i> needs</i> Lomax, Lomax rejects his Faustian pact and chooses to
    kill himself; thus in one shot of film and with one shot of purloined revolver choosing
    the path of redemption and rejecting Satan&#146;s offer to &#145;walk with me&#146;. </font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">Aside from a piece of undoubtedly rivetting
    entertainment there are some pertinent points concerning the portrayal of both the lawyers
    and the legal process which perhaps demonstrate the emergence of a new trend. As we have
    outlined elsewhere in the past, legal films utilise a series of binary themes, be they
    pitting good against evil, man against woman, black against white or legal procedure
    against justice. These binary themes echo the adversarial notion of the common law system
    and the juxtaposition of opposites in need of resolution. There are a number of films that
    pursue this divide by looking at what a lawyer might be prepared to do in order to achieve
    what the lawyer perceives to be &#145;right&#146; or &#145;just&#146;&#151;is the lawyer
    prepared to go beyond the law to achieve justice? For example, in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Cape+Fear+(1991)"><i>Cape Fear</i></a> the defence attorney
    takes the decision to not reveal details of the witness&#146;s prior sexual
    history&#151;had he done so his client would have received a lesser sentence. The lawyer
    takes the decision to withhold evidence as <i>in his opinion</i> this would achieve a more
    just result.<i> Cape Fear</i> reveals stark ambiguities in how we approach such a problem
    and raises important questions of duty and ethics. These are even more marked in the
    remake when the client (Robert de Niro) teaches himself the law and &#145;tries&#146; his
    former lawyer (Nick Nolte) on a boat.</font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">A similar issue is pursued in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Few+Good+Men,+A+(1992)"><i>A Few Good Men</i></a> where the
    debate is one of to whom is the ultimate duty owed and where does &#145;the law&#146; fit
    into the equation? The soldiers facing court martial display their ultimate affiliation
    firmly&#151;first and foremost their duty is to their marine corps; god and country are
    secondary to the bond between their comrades and this is the fulcrum of the film: are
    orders to be obeyed at all costs and where does the buck stop? Similarly the lawyer (Tom
    Cruise) defending the two marines in <i>A Few Good Men</i> has to consider whether he
    should go beyond the legal and ethical codes under which he is bound and accuse a witness
    on the stand of committing a crime for which the two marines are accused. He of course
    does and justice is done&#151;but how is the law served by this? Whilst Cher in <i>Suspect</i>
    accepts the help of the juror with impunity to achieve the result she wants, it leaves the
    viewer somewhat uneasy. Although we are informed and aware that the accused here is in
    fact not guilty does this mean that we should permit flagrant breaches of due process and
    scant regard for the rule of law? Should lawyers play god?</font></p>
    <i><p align="JUSTIFY"></i><font face="Verdana">The film<i> The Devil&#146;s Advocate</i>
    encompasses this notion of the unbridled &quot;power&quot; of lawyers, certainly when
    influenced by supernatural forces, but it more importantly accepts a critical view of the
    day to day conduct of lawyers. Manipulative, unconcerned with ethical practices, power
    hungry and most importantly vain, the portrayal is throughout unflattering. Long gone is
    the dewy eyed representation of the champion of the poor and underdog, lawyers it seems
    are now fair game for a long overdue critical examination. Thus the terrain has
    imperceptibly shifted into a cinematic acceptance of lawyers as a destructive selfish
    influence, after all Satan is the chief partner looking to pass the control of the
    practice over to his two offspring to create the ultimate in legal hegemony. The continual
    theme throughout is one of the law and lawyers as forces of disorder hence the satanic
    interest in legal practice, the vices of vanity and avarice are awash. This is the crucial
    point&#151;the vast majority of previous depictions had a background of justice with
    lawyers fighting for what was right and good, the acquittal in the face of overwhelming
    odds. Here the position is reversed with the capacity for evil dominating the backdrop, no
    longer is law a positive force, although yet again the lawyer with a conscience comes to
    the fore and saves the day.</font><p>
