    reveals some plot details.&nbsp; Readers who have not seen the film may want to bookmark
    this site and return to read this commentary after they have seen the film.]<br>
    <br>
    </small></strong>I have been particularly interested in the John Grisham industry, and
    have written elsewhere that films made from his novels tend to portray lawyers as
    superheroes. I have come to conclude, however, that this is not necessarily a bad thing.
    The mood in Hollywood, and presumably, the United States, is decidedly anti-lawyer. More
    precisely, the mood is anti-rule of law. As a writer on this web site has argued, this is
    symbolized quite well (if heavy-handedly) in the film, <a href="devilsad.htm"><i>The
    Devil&#146;s Advocate</i></a>. Al Pacino as devil cum attorney is quite entertaining
    despite the disturbing perspective the film has about the role of the defense attorney in
    the American judicial system. Contending, incorrectly, that it is the business of defense
    attorneys to determine guilt or innocence beforehand on their own, and then to defend
    clients (or not) based solely on their own imperfect assessments, subverts a basic tenet
    of post-Enlightenment democratic societies. That almost quaint notion that the accused
    should be able to face his accuser and defend himself in front of his peers has somehow
    been rendered in film and television as the subversion of justice. Justice, in turn, is
    implicitly conceptualized as something one can know in advance of legal procedures which
    merely, it would seem, muddy the waters.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">As I have already hinted, Rainmaker is, indeed, in the Grisham
    mode. But it resists the kind of uncomplicated cartoonish good lawyer we found in his
    earliest work, The Firm. For the subject of Rainmaker is arguably the single most
    unpopular kind of law and lawyering: the ambulance chaser and the compensatory damages
    lawsuit. Grisham asks us to entertain the possibility that while lawyers may be crooked
    and greedy, not all are. And, further, that while some lawsuits may be frivolous and
    contrived, others really are about justice; even those seeking compensatory damages. In
    fact, the central lawsuit in the film<big>&#151;</big>that of a family suing an insurance
    company for fraudulently failing to honor a medical policy and thus resulting in the death
    of a young man<big>&#151;</big>is exactly the kind of David and Goliath case that I wish
    was motivating so many of my students to go on and study law. Yes, Danny DeVito plays the
    role of a loser, shyster ambulance-chaser who can't even pass the bar. But he is in
    practice, as it turns out, a rather competent trial attorney. The real hero, of course, is
    the winsome Matt Damon whose commitment to his clients and their righteous plights enables
    him to win a huge settlement (50 million dollars) for the mother of the dead boy. And
    though she will never collect any of it as the insurance company immediately declares
    bankruptcy, we, the audience, are left feeling that justice has been done and the good
    guys have won. More importantly, and I think this is Grisham's genius (such as it is); the
    lawyers accomplish this feat by following the law.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But wait! Our young hero decides to leave the legal profession
    anyway. He fears that he may cross that line and become merely another lawyer joke. And
    this ending is one of two very strange and un-Grisham-like moments in this film: The kid
    lawyer seems to end up agreeing with the <a href="devilsad.htm"><em>The Devil's Advocate</em></a>
    crowd that he should only defend good people. We know this when he pointedly asks the
    insurance company's lead counsel, when did you sell out? And we know this because he
    leaves the profession presumably fearing (and his fears have some merit, to be sure) that
    he won't always be defending the good against evil. In fact, he may all too often be hired
    as the devil's advocate. The second weird un-Grisham like moment is even weirder
    principally because its implications are virtually ignored in the film. The fact is that
    our little hero has actually helped to murder his girlfriend's abusive husband, and then
    left the scene, and lied to the police about both his involvement and her culpability.
    What we are left with is the notion that his active participation in murder is
    sanctionable since the husband was a monster. His defending monstrous insurance companies
    is then somehow likened to an attorney who defends a wife-beater.</font></p>
