    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana">The Verdict: </font><em>&quot;They
    Pay Us To Win!&quot;</em></h1>
    <p><strong><em><font face="Verdana">by John Denvir, USF Law School</font></em></strong><big> </big>(May
    1998)</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">At first viewing, <i>The Verdict</i> does not appear to be a
    &quot;law noir&quot; since the main plot is revolves around the redemption of a hack
    lawyer. Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) starts out the movie as a cynical alcoholic ambulance
    chaser whose life is turned around by a personal injury suit. He represents a young woman
    who is permanently comatose because a doctor gave her the wrong anesthesia. At first,
    Galvin is ready to accept the offer of a small settlement to avoid a trial against a big
    Boston defense firm, but he finally decides that he has to give his client her &quot;day
    in court.&quot; A happy ending prevails.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">If we look at <i>The Verdict</i> from the perspective of
    Galvin&#146;s adversary Ed Concannon (James Mason) we see the genius of the screenwriter.
    David Mamet gives us one of the darkest visions of the large corporate American law firm
    ever portrayed on film. We first see Concannon as he addresses his &quot;team&quot; of
    more than a dozen young associates about the upcoming trial. The setting is a large
    conference room&#150; which seems to be a cross between a library in an old mansion,
    complete with ornate fire place and African-American retainer in a white jacket serving
    coffee, and a law school seminar room, complete with blackboard and the latest in audio
    visual technology. Concannon, dressed in a professorial cardigan sweater, makes some very
    small jokes to which the young associates respond with nervous titters. It&#146;s clear
    that they both respect and fear Concannon. And we soon see why as he outlines his plans to
    use every possible tool to zealously represent his client.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Our next view of Concannon shows him in the same conference room
    &quot;prepping&quot; one of the doctors for his testimony on direct examination. The
    examination takes place before the same group of young associates who now act as a mock
    jury. The doctor is rather pompous, much too taken with himself than is healthy for a man
    who has effectively ended a young mother&#146;s life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Concannon methodically destroys him through ridicule so that he
    can rebuild him as a witness who will project the image Concannon needs to win. The
    &quot;jury&quot; is suitably impressed, but the viewer realizes that what the real jury
    will hear has less to do with what happened in the operating room that what Concannon
    scripted in his own head. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">When I said that Concannon will use &quot;every possible
    tool&quot; to represent his client, I wasn&#146;t kidding. He has planted a spy in
    Galvin&#146;s camp to keep him informed of the plaintiff&#146;s plans. For this role, he
    recruits an attractive woman associate (Charlotte Rampling) who is returning to the firm
    after a bad divorce. She proceeds to allow Gavin to pick her up in a bar and begins an
    affair to last the length of the trial. The movie&#146;s most affecting scene comes when
    Rampling makes a late night visit to Concannon&#146;s office to pick up her &quot;blood
    money.&quot; In addition to a check placed in her handbag as if she were a &quot;call
    girl,&quot; Concannon also gives her a little lecture on the economics of the large
    American law firm. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">He recalls how as a young associate, his senior partner had asked
    him how he did on a case. To the young Concannon&#146;s reply that he did the &quot;best
    he could,&quot; the older lawyer replied: &quot;Your best isn&#146;t good enough;
    we&#146;re paid to win.&quot; Concannon now agrees that the older lawyer was right.
    Lawyers are paid to win. He goes on to add that it is &quot;winning&quot; which pays for
    all the &quot;perks&quot; of working in a large firm, not only the glitzy offices, but
    also the &quot;pro bono&quot; cases young associates are so proud of, and even the leisure
    for philosophical chats about &quot;justice&quot; which seem to raise the practice of law
    to more than a mercenary pursuit. He concludes: &quot;You wanted to return to the world.
    Welcome back!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Of course, <i>The Verdict</i> is a movie and Concannon an
    overdrawn character. Lawyers, even high-powered defense lawyers, don&#146;t hire femme
    fatales to infiltrate the adversary&#146;s camp. Still the Concannon character has the
    smell of truth about him. The queasy combination of aristocratic trimmings (the palatial
    conference room, the servant in livery) and high tone vocabulary are used to conceal a
    more base reality; it&#146;s all about winning and winning is about money. In fact, that
    is the same taunt that Galvin&#146;s working class clients throw at him. &quot;You&#146;re
    all the same. It&#146;s all about money!&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In some way the charge is unfair. If it is about money, it is so
    because the plaintiffs came to the lawyer to file a lawsuit to recover money. The lawyer
    is the vehicle, not the driver. And if lawyers earn fees, there&#146;s nothing shameful in
    that. Lawyers have to eat and pay mortgages like anyone else. Clearly they have a right to
    earn a decent livelihood. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But the charge against the legal profession still stings because
    under the Concannon theory, it&#146;s &quot;only about money.&quot; The talk about justice
    is just one more example of empty rhetoric. That&#146;s the challenge <i>The Verdict</i>
    sets out to the profession. Laypeople want more law to be more than &quot;only about
    money.&quot; Of course, so do most lawyers. The problem is how to transform a
    multi-billion dollar business back into a profession. Unfortunately, &quot;noirs&quot;
    only pose questions; they never provide solutions.</font></p>
