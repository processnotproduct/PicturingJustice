    Election Primer</b></font><font face="Verdana"><p>
    <p><em>Professor Paul Joseph, Nova Southeastern University Law Center </em>(November
    1998)<b><p>
    <p></b>As another election cycle winds down, the only thing that is clear is that the
    &quot;culture wars&quot; which have plagued us of late continue. The Republican National
    Committee has launched a $10 million blitz aimed at convincing the American people that
    one person&#146;s stupid private sex tricks are not only our business but are a good
    litmus test for official competence (something that must come as a surprise to those who
    thought that John F. Kennedy was a pretty good President while Richard Nixon was not).</p>
    <p>Inevitably, the rabid right&#146;s message becomes one of &quot;return.&quot; That
    America should return to a nicer,<img src="images/pleaseant-comjdpic_bw.jpg" alt="pleaseant-comjdpic_bw.jpg (14587 bytes)" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="172" height="252"> safer, crime-free, &quot;family values&quot; past that never
    was, but which anyone from my generation can immediately recognize as idealized
    pre-feminist family life from television situation comedies set in the 1950's.</p>
    <p>Now, just when we need it, writer-director Gary Ross reminds us that the 50's fantasy
    has a dark side. The peaceful, tranquil, orderly facade is maintained by rigidly
    suppressing dissent and difference in a stifling society where violence is never far from
    the surface. </p>
    <p>The film <i>Pleasantville</i> is a fable and the basics of the plot are well enough
    known that it gives nothing away to say that two 90's teens, one a cynical overly sexual
    but ultimately vulnerable young woman and the other a sensitive but nerdy young man, are
    magically transported into the black and white world of a television situation comedy and
    that, as they begin to bring emotional depth to the one-dimensional townspeople, the
    affected ones start to burst forth in, as it would have been said in the early days of the
    medium, &quot;living color.&quot;</p>
    <p>The first half of the film is played lightly and with good humor. A scene where the
    repressed mother discovers masturbation, causing the tree outside her window to burst into
    spontaneous flames, is particularly effective.</p>
    <p>But the movie soon takes a more serious turn. The old guard, who are, of course, still
    black and white,<img src="images/pleasant-bgame_bw.jpg" alt="pleasant-bgame_bw.jpg (30506 bytes)" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="364" height="262"> correctly perceive that a revolution is taking place as more of
    the townspeople explore new ideas and new ways of life. </p>
    <p>&quot;No coloreds&quot; read the signs in the establishment&#146;s businesses and the
    use of that term is an intentional reminder of the rigid racial segregation and oppression
    of the often idealized 1950's. Soon, the town fathers are demanding that &quot;their&quot;
    women get back to the kitchen while more hot-headed elements begin burning books. </p>
    <p>The film even culminates in a trial set in a courtroom deeply reminiscent of that in
    the film <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?To+Kill+a+Mockingbird+(1962)"><i>To Kill a
    Mockingbird</i></a>. Here too, the &quot;coloreds&quot; are relegated to the balcony and
    to the defendant&#146;s table.<i><p>
    <p>Pleasantville</i> can be criticized for becoming too heavy-handed in its moralizing.
    Yet, for an electorate which never knew the 50's except through endless re-runs of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?%22Leave+It+to+Beaver%22+(1957)"><i>Leave it to Beaver</i></a>,
    <i>Pleasantville</i> is a necessary reminder that freedom, while unsettling,
    disconcerting, sometimes dangerous, and discomforting, is still better than the
    alternative. </font><p>
