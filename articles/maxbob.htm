    <td valign="TOP" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana">Maximum Bob <em>is Maximum Bad</em></font></h1>
    <p><i><b><font face="Verdana">Professor Johnny Burris, Nova Southeastern University Law
    Center</font></b> </i><b><font face="Verdana">(September, 1998)</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">ABC&#146;s late summer television series <i>Maximum Bob</i> is
    very loosely based on Elmore Leonard's quirky 1991 novel of the same name. The television
    series chronicles life in the rural southern Florida town of Deep Water (the novel was set
    in Palm Beach County) and its unusual circuit court judge, Bob Gibbs, who is also known as
    &#147;Maximum Bob&#148; or &#147;Big.&#148;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Judge Gibbs, portrayed by Beau Bridges, is a self-centered,
    corrupt, politically incorrect, sexual harassing, law-and-order judge who dominates the
    local political and social scene. In various episodes, he has accepted a bribe in the form
    of a contribution to his campaign for governor in exchange for ruling in the defendant's
    favor in a civil case and unsuccessfully lusted after defense attorney Kathy Baker.&nbsp;
    Gibbs takes great joy in imposing the maximum sentence on those convicted in his
    courtroom. This proclivity earned him the nickname Maximum Bob,&#148; hence the title of
    the novel and television series. Judge Gibbs is also a man of great ambition.&nbsp; He
    wants to become Governor of Florida and he does not hesitate to use and abuse his judicial
    office to aid him in fulfilling this ambition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Judge Gibbs has two female protagonists. Kathy Baker, portrayed by
    Liz Vassey, is a sophisticated liberal Miami defense attorney who comes to Deep Water to
    represent a man in a parole violation hearing before Judge Gibbs and inexplicably decides
    to stay. It should be noted that in Leonard's novel, Kathy Baker was a probation officer.
    Apparently this role in the justice system was too tame for the television show, and so
    the character was upgraded to an attorney. While it appears attorney Baker is supposed to
    bring Judge Gibbs up short, she in fact does not do so. In court, she specializes in
    losing cases over which Judge Gibbs presides. For example, in the first episode attorney
    Baker is horrified when Judge Gibbs sentences her client to death by electrocution in
    &quot;old sparky&quot; for violating his parole by drinking one beer. Nonetheless, the
    show assumes attorney Baker is a serious thorn in Judge Gibbs' side.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The second protagonist, Leanne Baker, portrayed by Kiersten
    Warren, is Judge Gibbs&#146;s spouse. She is an unusual free spirit and source of vexation
    for Judge Gibbs, because she is periodically possessed by the spirit of Wanda Grace, a
    12-year-old African American girl who was a slave before the Civil War. This causes Judge
    Gibbs some very embarrassing moments, such as when this spirit emerges during a press
    conference concerning his governorship quest. Each week Leanne Baker also has
    misadventures with other supporting characters in the show.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The town of Deep Water is also populated by some uncommon
    supporting characters including a good-hearted and love-sick sheriff who lusts after Kathy
    Baker, a group of inept sheriff deputies, and the Crowe family, a bizarre anti-social
    group that reminds me of a moneyless Clampett family (from The Beverly Hillbillies, which
    aired from 1962-71) with criminal traits. Each week these characters are supposed to
    provide interesting diversions from the main story line.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><i>Maximum Bob</i> is supposed to be a humorous show. It is using
    a formula, the urban rural conflict, that reminds me of &quot;<i>Northern Exposure</i>&quot;
    (which aired from 1990-95). Unfortunately, <i>Maximum Bob </i>lacks the polish and wit of <i>Northern
    Exposure</i>. Most of the episodes are so poorly edited it is difficult to follow the
    story line. If you had read Leonard's novel you would be able to overcome some of the
    editing problems by filling in the gaps with information from his book. But this becomes
    less true with each passing episode, as the show wanders further and further from the plot
    line in the book. Even if the show were better executed, I ultimately find that Judge
    Gibbs' conflicts with his spouse and attorney Baker fall flat. The adventures of the other
    unusual characters inhabiting Deep Water also give one little reason to be amused.&nbsp;
    In short, <i>Maximum Bob</i> is just not funny. It has more in common with the
    cartoon-like &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (which aired from 1979-85) than the more
    sophisticated humor of <i>Northern Exposure</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The show also lacks even a quasi-realistic feel in its legal
    proceedings. One would expect more in a show that features a circuit court judge as its
    central character and at least one or two courtroom scenes in each episode. In <i>Maximum
    Bob</i>, the law and the legal system are treated merely as background, a stage where
    Judge Gibbs offers offensive commentary which is supposed to be humorous. For that reason,
    whenever the show moves to the courtroom it seems as if Judge Gibbs is doing a brief
    stand-up comedy routine rather than presiding over any type of legal proceeding. For
    example, in one episode attorney Baker brings a civil lawsuit on behalf of her male client
    seeking his reinstatement as a member of a mermaid swimming show. In the courtroom scene
    Judge Gibbs makes a sexist speech defending the right of the mermaid show operator to have
    a female-only cast and dismisses the lawsuit. Attorney Baker says almost nothing during
    this legal proceeding. While this type of scene may in some feeble way advance the show's
    plot, it lacks all credibility in the way it portrays the legal system.</font></p>
