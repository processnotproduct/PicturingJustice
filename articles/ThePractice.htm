    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana">The Practice&#151;Emmy Winning
    Episode?</font></h1>
    <p><strong><em><font face="Verdana">by Michael Asimow, UCLA Law School </font></em></strong>(January
    1998)</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><i>The Practice</i> has presented consistently above average
    law-firm drama from its inauspicious Saturday night 10 PM time slot. It features a
    bottom-feeding scrappy law firm struggling to survive by taking cases nobody else wants.
    Ethical dilemmas are frequently presented and ethical rules often stretched. Some of the
    story lines verge on soapopera as <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?%22L%2EA%2E+Law%22+(1986)"><i>L. A. Law</i></a> did
    so often. But many of the stories on <i>The Practice</i> have been exceptionally
    interesting. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The firm's five lawyers (three men, two women), are carefully
    sketched and quite believable. Most of them seem to have rather desolate personal lives.
    All are dedicated to their clients and to the firm's survival. The firm includes a
    strongly written black character, Eugene. The two women (Ellenor and Lindsay) are
    excellent lawyers. Their characters are balanced, interesting, and nuanced (so different
    from the consistently negative portrayals of female lawyers in the movies or from the
    trashy <a href="mcbealnhayes.htm"><em>Ally McBeal</em></a>). Lindsay, for example, is a
    whiz at search and seizure. As a result, she has developed a practice of representing drug
    dealers whom she thoroughly despises.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The senior lawyer, Bobby Donnell, is a superb advocate, who
    experiences a huge amount of stress in keeping the firm together. The fifth lawyer, Jimmy,
    was a bank loan officer before joining the firm. Bobby took him in as a favor after Jimmy
    lost his bank job by giving the firm a loan they didn't qualify for. Seriously deficient
    in lawyerly skills but determined to carry his weight somehow, Jimmy is the most
    interesting character of all. His deposition of the defendant in a dogbite case recently
    was quite memorable. The firm's sole secretary, Rebecca, calms emotional outbursts,
    provides sage personal counsel, and worries about the receivables. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In its November 22 episode, <i>The Practice</i> transcended the TV
    courtroom genre and delivered an astonishing and deeply moving episode that deserves Emmy
    consideration. Donnell's firm is called in to a Southern state by the Death Penalty
    Project with only eighteen hours to go before the scheduled execution of convicted killer
    Randy Jefferson. There are serious questions about the fairness of Jefferson's trial and
    there have been numerous lawyer goofs in the post-conviction appellate process. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Frantically, the firm's lawyers try everything<big>&#151;</big>clemency
    board, state and federal habeas, the governor<big>&#151;</big>as the seconds tick away.
    They come up with evidence that the prosecutor suppressed critical evidence (a lie
    detector test given to the jailhouse snitch whose testimony convicted Jefferson). There's
    a brief stay by the Fifth Circuit which the Supreme Court immediately vacates. The lethal
    drug is administered and Jefferson dies. And the lawyers now have to return to their law
    practice and their lives.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In intensity, the script and performances approach that of the
    remarkable film <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Dead+Man+Walking+(1995)"><i>Dead
    Man Walking</i></a>. The format is that a documentarian is making a film about Jefferson's
    last day and the legal machinations intended to halt or delay the execution. The use of
    hand-held cameras and off-screen questions by the documentarian is ingenious and very
    effective as a dramatic device. All players, including the victim's parents and
    Jefferson's family, get to say their piece. Public opinion is sampled. Each lawyer gets to
    reveal his or her feelings. Ellenor (normally the consummate technician) says that she
    used to be fervently against the death penalty. Now, after a friend was murdered, she's
    not so sure. She now has a car, she says, but no bumper stickers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The focus is the effect the Jefferson case has on the five
    lawyers. The stress, obviously, is almost unbearable. Their emotions are on a
    roller-coaster as they glimpse some hope and then it is dashed. This is the real strength
    of the Randy Jefferson episode--and of many stories on <i>The Practice</i>: the insights
    into a lawyer's working life and the effect law practice (especially criminal defense) has
    on a lawyer's feelings of self-worth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Jimmy draws the job of being with Jefferson in his death row cell
    during the final day and evening. As always, Jimmy is stuck with the task nobody else
    wants, one that doesn't call for any legal skills. Jimmy has to relate to Jefferson (who
    tries to make it easy for him) and his family. But Jimmy hates the whole business. He
    loathes Jefferson, sympathizes with the victim and her family, and favors the death
    penalty in this case. By the end, though, he has bonded with Jefferson and isn't so sure
    about his views. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">I suspect <em>The Practice</em> won't survive another season. It
    has little chance to draw an audience in its time slot. Its demise would be a shame,
    because (like <i>Law and Order</i> and <a href="mcbealnhayes.htm"><i>Michael Hayes</i></a>)
    <i>The Practice</i> is consistently excellent. Sometimes, as in the Nov. 22th episode, it
    is truly and memorably outstanding.</font></p>

    &nbsp; With much fanfare, <em>The Practice</em> moves to Monday night in January.]</small></strong></font></p>
