    <p><font face="Verdana"><b><i>by Michael Asimow, UCLA Law School </i></b>(September 1998)</font>&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Here come the judges<i>. <a href="http://fox17.citysearch.com/judge_judy.html">Judge Judy</a>, <a href="http://www.thepeoplescourt.com/">People&#146;s Court</a></i>, and <i>Judge Mills
    Lane</i> are gaveling their way right through daytime TV with two more real court
    television shows about to debut. And then there&#146;s the spoof of Judge Judy now running
    on the Playboy Channel.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Leading the pack is <i>Judge Judy </i>with the acerbic Judge Judy
    Scheindlin on the bench. This show is now in its fourth season. Judge Scheindlin was a New
    York family court judge for many years before becoming a TV star. The revival of <i>People&#146;s
    Court </i>is into its second season with former New York City mayor Ed Koch wielding the
    gavel. This fall <i>Judge Mills Lane</i> joined the pack. Judge Lane is a former Nevada
    state judge and boxing referee who labels himself &quot;America&#146;s judge.&quot;</font>&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">According to the Los Angeles Times, in a few weeks <i>Judge Joe
    Brown </i>(starring a Memphis judge) will debut. And, for a trip down memory lane, the
    beloved Judge Wapner (the old star of <i>People&#146;s Court</i>) is about to resurface in
    <i>Animal Court</i> on the Animal Planet cable network. As strange as this sounds, it will
    probably differ little from the other shows, which frequently feature disputes about pets.
    Earlier plans for former LA prosecutor Vince Bugliosi to host another real court show have
    apparently been scrapped.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Judge Judy has received the ultimate tribute&#151;she&#146;s being
    spoofed by &quot;Judge Julie&quot; whose <i>Sex Court </i>is now running on the Playboy
    Channel. Judge Julie dresses in a much more provocative manner than her competition.
    According to <a href="http://www.playboy.com/entertainment/playboy/pbtv/sex_court/get/get.html">Playboy&#146;s
    website</a> , one of Judge Julie&#146;s cases concerns a woman whose boyfriend has a video
    of her between the sheets. She&#146;s trying to prevent him from marketing the video. As a
    dedicated nonsubscriber to this premium channel, however, I can&#146;t give you any more
    information on Judge Julie.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Real court shows involve actual, unscripted disputes between real
    people. A judge hears the testimony; after a commercial break, the judge hands down a
    decision. The judge handles the trial in an inquisitorial manner. There are no lawyers.
    The judge fires questions at the litigants (or the occasional non-party witness) in an
    attempt to get at the truth. The parties don&#146;t get to ask any questions.</font>&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Typically the cases center on sharp disputes about credibility
    with each litigant calling the other a liar. The cases concern relatively small matters
    which can be easily understood but the litigants are passionately involved. Watching all
    three shows, I saw an assortment of the kinds of cases one would expect to see in small
    claims court.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <blockquote>
      <font face="Verdana"><p>A nasty dispute about cell phone charges between a mother and
      daughter (the judge&#146;s staff had researched the bills to see where the calls had
      gone).</font><p>
      <font face="Verdana"><p>A dispute between neighbors about a pit bull that killed a cat.</font>&nbsp;</p>
      <font face="Verdana"><p>A landlord-tenant dispute about whether rent had been paid and
      whether the apartment was damaged.</font>&nbsp;<p>
      <font face="Verdana"><p>A dispute between a restaurant owner (white) and some customers
      (African-American) whom he threw out of the restaurant.</font>&nbsp;</p>
      <font face="Verdana"><p>A dispute in which a model claimed she was entitled to get paid
      for a topless shoot but the defendant claimed that she would get paid only if the photo
      won a contest.</font><p>
    </blockquote>
    <font face="Verdana"><p>The parties are compensated for their appearance on the shows in a
    way that preserves their incentives. <i>People&#146;s Court</i> explains that the
    litigants will share a fund (the size of which depends on the size of the amount in
    dispute). Depending on the judge&#146;s decision, either the plaintiff or the defendant
    will get a larger share of the fund. Thus the defendant doesn&#146;t really have to pay
    the damages and the plaintiff gets paid something for her trouble even though she loses
    the case. Nevertheless the parties have a definite financial stake in the decision because
    the division of the fund depends on the judge&#146;s decision.</font><p>
    <font face="Verdana"><p>There are substantial differences between the shows. Judge Judy is
    extremely strict and maintains careful control of the trial. She does not allow the
    litigants to interrupt one another. She feels free to lecture the parties, especially if
    she senses that someone has acted irresponsibly. Indeed, she often tells them off.</font>&nbsp;</p>
    <font face="Verdana"><p>Judge Koch lets the parties mix it up more&#151;they frequently
    get into shouting matches with each other and seem close to coming to blows on screen.
    However, he tries to joke around with the parties and renders his decision without
    berating them. <i>People&#146;s Court</i> is into gimmicks. You can email your opinion of
    how the trial is going and who should win. Thus we have a currently updated guide to the
    public&#146;s reaction. Attorney Harvey Levin views the trial in shopping malls with a
    dozen or so shoppers who are invited to express their opinions about the litigants and
    about the judge&#146;s decision after it&#146;s handed down. He also dispenses legal
    advice suggested by the dispute (&quot;always get a receipt if you pay your rent in
    cash&#133;&quot;) The litigants also have a chance to express their opinions about the
    verdict after it&#146;s handed down.</font>&nbsp;<p>
    <font face="Verdana"><p>Judge Lane is still developing his style; he seems more strict
    than Koch but less strict than Scheindlin. His show is pretty plain vanilla and lacks
    gimmicks. He does look very tough however, as befits a former Marine, boxer, and boxing
    referee. (Lane was the referee in the infamous Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield ear biting
    fight).</font>&nbsp;</p>
    <font face="Verdana"><p>The question is why so many viewers are tuning into these shows.
    Personally, I find them both annoying and tedious. What am I missing? <i>Judge Judy</i> is
    whacking the competition in Los Angeles and appears twice each weekday. People are
    watching and there are plenty of sponsors. From the point of view of producers and local
    stations, obviously the shows are relatively cheap to stage, at least as compared to a
    soap opera. Yet what&#146;s the explanation for their appeal to viewers? I can think of
    several theories.</font>&nbsp;<p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">People seem obsessed with law and are fascinated by judges and
    trials; perhaps they feel that they will learn something useful for their own lives by
    watching the shows. Perhaps this curiosity was stoked by the endless TV coverage of the OJ
    trial. <i>People&#146;s Court </i>recognizes the function of the shows as self-help
    manuals by dispensing little dollops of legal advice after each case.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Unlike talk shows, the real court shows have resolution. The judge
    always decides the case before our eyes. Somebody wins, somebody loses. But on a talk
    show, bad people can walk away without any consequences and victims don&#146;t get any
    redress. I think viewers hunger for quick, definitive resolutions to big messy problems.</font>&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Another theory is that real court shows should be viewed as game
    shows. When you watch <i>Jeopardy</i> you match wits with the contestants. Here you match
    wits with the judge. Will the judge resolve the credibility dispute the same way you did?
    Did you know the law before the judge stated it? Will he/she apply the law the same way
    you would have applied it? In this sense, the court shows can be viewed as participatory. <i>People&#146;s
    Court</i> recognizes this important point by making itself interactive. You can actually
    register your opinion by sending an email and ordinary shoppers in the mall get to sound
    off about how they would have decided the case.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">A taste for verbal violence is also involved. The litigants get
    really nasty toward each other. And Judge Judy gets really nasty to them. Judge Koch
    doesn&#146;t abuse the litigants but he allows the litigants to yell at each other. Thus
    the same people who like professional wrestling or <i>Jerry Springer</i> may be attracted
    to real court shows. It&#146;s a bit like the pleasure of watching a barroom brawl when
    you don&#146;t have to get punched yourself.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But something else is at work here. A key point is that real
    people are airing real disputes in an unscripted hearing. Viewers seem to have a hunger
    for this sort of reality&#151;to see the problems of people just like themselves. Some of
    it, no doubt, is the pleasure of being a voyeur&#151;you get to poke your nose into other
    people&#146;s personal quarrels.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">More fundamentally, though, I think many people today are quite
    isolated. Daytime TV viewers may feel stuck at home&#151;perhaps unemployed or retired,
    perhaps watching small kids. They may be lonely. They may not know anyone on their street,
    may have nobody to talk to on the phone, may be far from family. If they have a partner at
    all, that person is away for the day. As you watch the commercials on daytime TV for
    vocational schools or lawyers to help in your workers&#146; comp case, you get the feeling
    that a lot of people who are watching wish they could go to work. Real court shows offer a
    vicarious relationship with real people. This may be more enticing than watching actors
    play roles in fictitious stories on soap operas.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">How else to explain the enormous success of <a href="http://www.jennicam.org/index.html">jennicam.org</a>? For those who haven&#146;t
    heard of it, this is one of the most popular sites on the internet. It&#146;s said to
    receive half a million hits per day. A young woman named Jenni works at home as a website
    designer. Cameras are running in her apartment 24 hours a day. And you just watch whatever
    she&#146;s doing; she may be sleeping, eating pizza, dressing, hanging out with her
    boyfriend, or playing with her cat. If you subscribe ($15 per year) you get a new picture
    two minutes. There are said to be ten to fifteen thousand &quot;members.&quot; But you can
    pop in as a &quot;guest&quot; for free and get a picture that&#146;s updated every twenty
    minutes.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Why are people interested in Jenni&#146;s humdrum life? To me, it
    seems inexpressibly boring. I really can&#146;t say, but it must have something to do with
    the fact that Jenni is a real person who has opened up her life to anyone who cares to
    visit. And, people seem to have a hunger for human contact&#151;even contact of this
    third-rate variety. In interviews, Jenni says that she gets a great amount of mail from
    people telling her their life story. Evidently, these people have decided that they really
    know her. [Warning: if you visit this site, avoid jennicam.com which is a hard-core
    pornography site free-riding on Jenni&#146;s success. The correct address is <a href="http://www.jennicam.org/index.html">jennicam.org</a>]&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">And then there&#146;s <i>The Truman Show</i>, one of this
    year&#146;s truly outstanding films. As everyone must know, the premise of the film is
    that Truman Burbank (superbly played by Jim Carrey) is the star of a 24-hour a day soap
    opera but doesn&#146;t know it. Everyone else on the show, including his wife and boss,
    are acting but Truman goes about his life (on a gigantic set) thinking it is real.
    Personally, I found this one of the scariest movies I have ever seen&#151;because the
    premise is so horribly plausible. Especially the part about the huge worldwide audience
    that follows avidly every trivial detail of Truman&#146;s life. At this point, after
    watching the real court TV shows and pondering the success of <i>jennicam.org, </i>it is
    entirely believable that billions of people would actually care about watching Truman get
    up in the morning, eat his breakfast, chat with his &quot;wife,&quot; greet his neighbors,
    and go to work.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">I would like to acknowledge the work of my student Samantha
    Slipock, whose excellent paper <i>&quot;Judge Judy</i> and <i>The People&#146;s Court</i>:
    The Phenomenon of the &#145;Real Court&#146; Television Genre,&quot; drew my attention to
    these shows and furnished some of the material in this article. Her take on the popularity
    of the genre is that it feeds off of the unpopularity of lawyers&#151;people approve of a
    justice system without lawyers in which litigants and the judge come up with justice on
    their own. She also believes that the shows allow people to keep an eye on the court
    system which they distrust. Anyone who wants a copy of Ms. Slipock&#146;s paper can email
    me at </font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF"><u>asimow@law.ucla.edu</u> </font>and
    I&#146;ll send you a copy.</p>
