    <td valign="top"><h1><font face="Verdana">Girl Lawyers and Boy Lawyers</font></h1>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Verdana">by John Denvir, USF Law School </font></strong></em>(November
    1997)</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The new television season throws up two more &quot;lawyer&quot;
    series: <em>Ally McBeal</em> and <em>Michael Hayes</em> And while both series featured
    talented actors in well-written scripts, they also incorporate the most stereotypical
    treatment of gender.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><em>Ally McBeal</em> revolves around the trials (mostly personal)
    of a recent female law school graduate of Harvard Law School who practices with a
    &quot;boutique&quot; Boston law firm. Ally is (of course) talented as well as beautiful,
    but somehow unlucky with men. She really shares more with Mary Tyler Moore than the
    Katherine Hepburn of <a href="TimetoKillAdamsRib.htm"><em>Adam&#146;s Rib</em></a>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">And while law is no more central to <em>Ally McBeal</em> than
    local television news was to <em>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</em>, its images of law are
    both powerful and negative. Ally seems to resigned to the fact that she has entered a
    profession dedicated to greed, and seems comfortable arguing cases she doesn&#146;t
    believe in. In fact, at one points she opines &quot;I&#146;m always more persuasive when I
    don&#146;t believe what I&#146;m saying.&quot; To be fair, her lack of idealism about law
    may stem from the greed and sexism she finds pervasive in the profession. Her partners are
    only interested in money, and often she feels her role as associate is more decorative
    than professional. As she puts it after an evening of smiling at potential clients,
    &quot;three years of law school and what matters most is my teeth.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Law plays a small role in <em>Ally McBeal</em>. It is clearly not
    a &quot;law&quot; show (like <em>Law and Order</em>), but a &quot;relationship&quot; show
    in the <em>Friends</em> vein. Most of the plots appear to revolve around Ally&#146;s quest
    for an appropriate mate. This, I guess, should not surprise us since it is conventional
    wisdom that women are &quot;relation-oriented.&quot; However, in focussing on the
    &quot;personal&quot; rather than the &quot;professional&quot;, the show&#146;s producers
    are knowingly perpetuating a gender stereotype and trivializing Ally&#146;s status as
    serious professional. I don&#146;t think she&#146;s &quot;partner&quot; material.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">If Ally McBeal sees law as a context in which to search for love, <em>Michael
    Hayes</em> sees it as an avenue to justice-- or at least revenge. Michael Hayes (played by
    former NYPD BLUE star David Caruso) is a working class kid who worked as a police officer
    while he attended night law school at St. John&#146;s and now is Acting U.S. Attorney in
    the Southern District of New York. He sees the world as the a manichean struggle of good
    and evil (need I add that he&#146;s an Irish Catholic), and he views the legal process as
    the bludgeon with which to set things matters right. The first show shows him avenging the
    death of a young girl murdered by a mob boss; the second shows him starting a trial in
    which he will avenge the bombing of his boss, the suicide of a good friend, and the
    maiming of his girl friend. Life and law for Michael are one long grudge match.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">This too is another gender stereotype: the lone ranger who brings
    justice to the corrupt town. Caruso draws heavily on his NYPD Blue character, but also is
    in a direct line of descent from Alan Ladd&#146;s <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Shane+(1953)"><em>Shane</em></a> and Clint
    Eastwood&#146;s <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Dirty+Harry+(1971)"><em>Dirty
    Harry</em></a>. So there we have it. &quot;Girl &quot; lawyers play &quot;house&quot;
    while the boy lawyers play &quot;cowboys and Indians.&quot; Will it ever end?</font></p>
