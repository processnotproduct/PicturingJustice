    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana"><i>Ultima Online</i>: Justice in a
    Virtual World</font></h1>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana"><em>by Paul Joseph, Nova Southeastern University Law
    Center </em></font></strong>(January 1998)<i><p>
    </i><p><font face="Verdana">Many forms of popular culture incorporate images of law or
    turn on the resolution of issues of justice. A number of academics have argued, from
    various perspectives, that the presentation of law and justice issues in popular media are
    worth serious attention. Because popular culture is mass culture, an image of law
    contained in a television program, for example, is unlikely to stray far from what would
    be accepted as &quot;probably true&quot; by its audience. In fact, some have also
    suggested that popular culture can serve a teaching function by raising important issues
    and by explaining them in ways which are understandable to the general audience. That is,
    that popular culture can serve as an educational tool. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The initial consumption of popular culture can be a passive
    experience. The consumers are the audience who watch and listen to a pre-programmed
    experience. It is hoped that the audience will think about what they are seeing or hearing
    and will discuss it with others. This may or may not occur. When popular culture materials
    are used in a classroom setting, there is an explicit focus on the issues raised and there
    is an increased likelihood that some form of interaction between teacher and students
    (and, it is to be hoped, among students) will take place.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">A different model of popular culture would be an interactive one
    in which the &quot;audience&quot; has been transformed into participants in a scenario
    which requires them to resolve issues of justice and law for themselves. Such a model is
    the &quot;holodeck&quot; from <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>, in which the
    &quot;players&quot; actually interact with a seemingly real but actually computer
    simulated environment. Similar is the adult playground portrayed in the movie <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Westworld+(1973)"><i>Westworld</i></a>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Some forms of interactivity exist in teaching materials such as
    the computerized lessons in law developed by CALI and some interesting CD-ROM products
    which simulate the courtroom experience complete with objections by the product user and
    rulings by a virtual judge. Limitations on the technology&#150;particularly the limits of
    the program&#146;s &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; and limits on data storage
    space&#150;have tended to impose severe limits on the number of choices which a user of
    the product can actually make. And, of course, these teaching materials are not intended
    for a mass audience. They are teaching tools for those who already have a growing
    technical expertise.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Yet, computerization, and especially computer games, may be
    heading towards the creation of a new popular culture form with the potential for great
    interactivity and which, within the context of <em>play</em>, can confront the user with
    issues of justice and law. This article is a brief report on a very early stage of this
    development.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In most computer games, an individual player matches wits against
    the program&#146;s artificial intelligence. Recent games have added the ability to match
    wits with small groups of actual players connected via modems. But these games are still
    narrow in scope with limited player choices available. They generally have an
    objective&#150;perhaps to kill the evil Daemon, to capture the castle, or to shoot down
    the airplane. When this goal is accomplished, the game is over until the next time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One new offering seems different from the standard computer game
    offering and may move one step toward a truly interactive popular culture medium. It is <i>Ultima
    Online</i>, an on-line game produced by Origin, a division of a giant of computer gaming,
    Electronic Arts. Although set in a familiar medieval fantasy world where magic works and
    strange beasts abound, U.O. is unusual in several significant respects.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">For one thing, the sheer size of the game sets it apart. Literally
    thousands of players from as far away as Germany and Japan can play at one time. In
    addition, the game never ends. That is, the servers run 24 hours a day (with the exception
    of scheduled maintenance), and the game never starts over. Rather, it progresses
    continuously. Players have a great deal of control over what happens in the game. As with
    text&#150;based &quot;MUDS,&quot; players can make changes in the environment which will
    continue to exist and with which other players can interact even when the creating player
    has logged off. For example, if a player builds a house, it will continue to be there even
    when the builder is off-line. Another player might break into the house and steal an item.
    When the original player returns, the item will be gone. Finally, Ultima&#146;s stunning
    graphics and full motion provide the illusion of being present inside the game. The sum
    total of these elements transcends what has gone before in the field of computer games. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><i>Ultima Online</i> is an <em>environment</em> in which players
    (through their character alter-egos) have a great many possibilities in deciding what they
    want to do. They can, of course, go adventuring with the aim of killing evil monsters and
    discovering hordes of treasure, but they can also form relationships, learn new skills,
    buy and sell, build homes, run shops, mine ore, mend armor, and fish. They can also kill
    and they can die. The game is as close as we can yet come to <i>Star Trek</i>&#146;s
    &quot;holodeck.&quot; It is a virtual reality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><i>Ultima Online</i> has existed for only a few months. Sales have
    surpassed 40,000 units. Approximately 25% of those who have signed up are on-line at any
    one time. Thus, there appears to be a continuity in which the same players interact with
    each other on an ongoing basis.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">It was always anticipated that player&#150;controlled characters
    could come into conflict and even kill each other. It should be noted that the
    &quot;death&quot; of a character is not final. A &quot;dead&quot; character can be
    &quot;resurrected&quot; by magic, although the process can result in the loss of some
    acquired skills which the player may have spent many hours developing. In addition, while
    the character is &quot;dead,&quot; its possessions are at the mercy of anyone who might be
    tempted to loot the &quot;body.&quot; Similarly, it is possible to steal possessions from
    a character. The loss may represent many hours of game play and cause a player
    considerable inconvenience. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The game was set up with the assumption that some players would
    tend to steal and kill and others would resist them. In a sense, issues of justice,
    morality, and law were built into the structure of the game. One of the fascinating
    aspects of the game, however, is that, even in its first months of operation, it has
    developed in ways unanticipated by the game designers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">As originally planned, towns were zones of safety where no crimes
    could be committed, but the areas outside of towns, the &quot;wilderness,&quot; was
    unregulated. The mechanism of law and order in towns was simple and brutal.
    Computer&#150;controlled &quot;guards&quot; instantly appear and kill any character who
    attacks another in town, who steals in town, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Almost immediately, however, an unanticipated problem developed.
    New players, who started out with 100 gold pieces and a few saleable possessions, were
    preyed upon by experienced players as soon as the &quot;newbies&quot; left the town.
    Because it appeared to some players that killing these new players was easier than
    obtaining wealth by more legitimate means, the level of such activity was much greater
    than had been anticipated. Players flooded the game staff with complaints, suggestions,
    and demands for reform. That reform is still in the process of being hammered out, but it
    has already brought about a number of changes designed to discourage indiscriminate
    player&#150;killing while not ruling it out altogether.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Under the new rules, many possessions disappear from new
    player-controlled characters when they are &quot;killed,&quot; thus making crimes against
    them less lucrative. In addition, steps were taken to make it harder to identify new
    players as new. Thus, the so called &quot;player-killer&quot; can never know for sure
    whether he or she is attacking a vulnerable opponent. Persistent player&#150;killing of
    &quot;good&quot; characters can result in the offender being identified as such an evil
    character that he or she will be killed on sight by the computer-controlled guards merely
    for entering a town. Essentially, this is a system of &quot;outlawry&quot; in which the
    condemned are forced to live outside the normal channels of society and commerce available
    to everybody else. A system of bounties will give players additional incentives to
    &quot;kill&quot; those who make a habit of indiscriminate &quot;killing.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The &quot;player-killers&quot; have not taken this lying down.
    Some have established player&#150;controlled fortresses from which they venture out to
    kill and to steal. Others have found ways to trick &quot;good&quot; players into becoming
    the aggressors in situations where the guards will kill them, thus doing the
    player-killer&#146;s work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The most interesting recent development has been the bare
    beginning of a &quot;good&quot; player vigilante movement. Some players have styled
    themselves guardians who routinely patrol areas and kill player-killers when they are
    found. Other ad-hoc groups of players have confronted particularly egregious
    player-killers. Such players have been told that their actions are unacceptable and must
    cease. One notorious player-killer was given an ultimatum to change or be hunted down.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Of course, this is only a game. No real person dies. Even so, its
    form and structure, and the apparent intensity of the players lead inevitably to questions
    about what is social and anti-social conduct, what is just and unjust, what is
    &quot;legal&quot; and what is not. The game rules do not clearly answer this question and
    it is the participants themselves who will, to a large degree, decide upon and enforce
    informal means of social control.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">It is my belief that <i>Ultima Online</i> is but a very early and
    crude example of the types of simulated reality games which will be produced in the
    future. As computing power expands and the programmers produce ever more sophisticated
    virtual environments, the new medium of mass on-line virtual reality games may provide a
    new way to raise issues of law and justice&#150;by allowing the &quot;audience&quot; to <em>live</em>
    those issues within the context of an interactive computer game.</font></p>
