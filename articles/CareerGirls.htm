    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1>Career Girls: <em>Leigh Rests on his Laurels</em></h1>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana"><em>Elisabeth Friedman, Western Michigan University </em>(February
    1998)</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Career Girls, directed and written by Mike Leigh, promised to be
    yet another of his intensely character-focused, soul-searching wonders. Again, it was
    created through his close collaboration with the actors, in an attempt to let the realism
    of human interaction shine from the silver screen. Unfortunately, he seems to have let his
    genre run away with him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In this movie, Leigh sets up what could be a very
    thought-provoking and sensitive situation: the six-year reunion of two misfit friends from
    North London Polytechnic, who have since become somewhat successful young professionals.
    The movie follows a standard outline for &quot;reunion&quot; flicks: the activities during
    a weekend in the present interspersed with flashbacks to college days. Between the two, we
    are led to understand that Annie (Lynn Steadman) and Hannah (Katrin Cartlidge) were drawn
    together through their problems (disfiguring dermatitis and neurotic shyness on the one
    hand; a history of childhood neglect and a present of excessive demands by an alcoholic
    mother on the other) in college. They also shared one young man's friendship, and
    another's sexual attentions, during that time. Today the friends seemed to have mostly
    solved their problems (including bad skin), but the difficulties of a past of shared male
    attentions linger on. In a series of coincidences they run into both men, which allows
    them to reflect on the remaining rivalry and affirm their friendship at the end.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The central problem with the movie is that in his attempt to bring
    the women and their friendship to life, Leigh (and perhaps his actor collaborators) has
    gone too far. The physical tics of the college students are overdone to the point that the
    older Annie seems to have almost no connection to the younger (though played by the same
    actress). The vehicle for the resolution of their rivalry, the present-day encounters with
    the men, are so unbelievable the characters themselves are forced to admit it. The lover
    turns out to be a real estate agent, and with apparent unrecognition shows them around an
    empty apartment, leering at what he believes is a lesbian couple. The friend magically
    appears on none other than the steps of their old college digs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">I don't wish to give the impression that this movie is worthless.
    Reunion movies (think <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Return+of+the+Secaucus+7+(1980)"><em>Return of the
    Secaucus 7</em></a>, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Big+Chill%2C+The+(1983)"><em>The
    Big Chill</em></a>, and most recently, <a href="GrossePointeBlank.htm"><em>Grosse Pointe
    Blank</em></a>) are a nice way to hone in on friendships, and it is refreshing to watch
    one that so clearly takes its female characters' lives and platonic relationship
    seriously. Moreover, as usual Leigh gives us decidedly unlikely heroines, and takes us
    through post-adolescent angst as well as mid-30s recovery. There are a couple of choice
    Leigh lines (my favorite from Hannah, gazing down from the balcony of a posh apartment:
    &quot;on a clear day, can you see the class struggle from up here?&quot;) and moments of
    moving connection between Hannah and Annie, both in the past and the present.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But overall, this was one of those movies during which you aren't
    too disappointed when the phone rings, and it just happens to be a good woman friend of
    yours&#151;from college perhaps&#151;who interrupts your video screening for some nice
    chat.</font></p>
