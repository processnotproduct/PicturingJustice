    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">At its best, the law is always about
    more than just maintaining the social order.&nbsp; All the really great tragedies
    concerning law, pit what scholars like to call, &quot;God's law&quot; against the laws of
    men. History is filled with people who have claimed to have disobeyed man's law out
    of&nbsp;a loyalty to some higher purpose. The problem almost always becomes how to tell
    the difference between mere self-interested lawlessness as against disobedience with
    higher moral intent. Thus, while one might be sympathetic to Antigone or Martin Luther
    King Jr., one might be less so to Oliver North.&nbsp; Brian De Palma's latest film, <i>Snake
    Eyes</i>, is another, albeit unlikely, entry into this conversation.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Lest you think De Palma has become
    didactic, let me assure you at the outset that this film operates just as well as a
    thoroughly enjoyable and uncomplicated thriller. For one, there is the&nbsp;fabulous
    performance by Nicholas Cage. Cage is nearly as over the top as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Leaving+Las+Vegas+(1995)"><i>Leaving Las Vegas</i></a>, but
    in this film, he is more comical (at least at first). Despite the &quot;R&quot; rating,
    there is very little of De Palma's trademark violence. Happily, however, the film is still
    vintage De Palma, and harks back to his earlier homage to Hitchcock in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Dressed+to+Kill+(1980)"><i>Dressed To Kill</i></a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Body+Double+(1984)"><i>Body Double</i></a>.</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">In its essence, Snake Eyes is a story
    is about law's connection to honor, dignity, and brotherhood. Heavy-weight boxing is used
    as the metaphor for the kind of male dignity that seems to appeal to directors like De
    Palma. The use of boxing in this manner has almost become a pop culture clich� as stories
    from the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Twilight+Zone%3A+The+Movie+(1983)"><i>Twilight
    Zone</i></a> to <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Raging+Bull+(1980)"><i>Raging Bull</i></a>
    to <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?On+the+Waterfront+(1954)"><i>On the Waterfront</i></a>,
    to <i>Rocky</i> attest.&nbsp; <i>Snake Eyes</i> takes place at a heavy-weight boxing match
    in Atlantic City. Nicholas Cage, plays Rick Santoro, a cynical, sleazy, wheeler-dealer
    Atlantic City police detective. Santoro is a cop on the take, hustling money from small
    time drug dealers, hustling bookies and cheating on his wife while babbling incessantly
    into his cellular phone. De Palma sets him up as a kind of&nbsp;coked-up singles bar
    hipster. In fact, the way that De Palma and Cage set up the Santoro character during the
    first 20-25 minutes of the film is itself worth the price of admission.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Santoro is pretty much the exact moral
    opposite of his best friend, Kevin Dunne. Dunne is a real straight arrow. He is a Navy
    commander now working security for the Department of Defense, his mission is to guard the
    Secretary of Defense. He fails, and it is here, as they say, that the plot thickens. It is
    here, too, that the film shows flashes of brilliance.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br>
    <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br>
    <font face="Verdana">In true Hitchcock fashion, the film now becomes about shifting
    identities and who is watching whom. In fact, if you want a real treat, rent Hitchcock's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Man+Who+Knew+Too+Much,+The+(1956)"><i>The Man Who Knew Too
    Much</i></a>, and pay particular attention to the scene where Doris Day goes to the opera
    house to stop the assassination. The scene in <i>Snake Eyes</i> where the Secretary of
    Defense gets killed is basically the same one. And it works just as well&#151;little to no
    dialogue and lots of long shots showing who sees what. It was, for me,&nbsp; the highlight
    of the film.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br>
    <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br>
    <font face="Verdana">What Santoro sees, for one, is a fighter (Lincoln Tyler played by <a href="http://www.shawbiz.com/stan2.htm">Stan Shaw</a>) taking a dive. Why he takes the
    dive is complicated and best left to the film to explain. But the plot device sets up a
    thematic structure enabling Santoro to get&nbsp; to make a similar choice later in the
    film. When he is finally offered blood money (rather obviously, I might add; the shot is
    literally of a bloody hundred dollar bill), it has less to do with the plot than it does
    with the themes of dignity, betrayal, integrity and male friendship. Santoro is a bad cop,
    and Dunne is his hero. When he realizes that Dunne is bad (he is involved in the plot
    against the secretary), Santoro has an epiphany: There are things that are more important
    than money; friendship, loyalty, and one's own dignity.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Though Dunne believes he is&nbsp;
    breaking the law for a higher moral purpose (one based in thinking not unlike the kind of
    right-wing militarism Ollie North espoused), Santoro is unconvinced. Devastated, Santoro
    feels personally betrayed by Dunne and is moved, for what may be the first time in his
    life, to put someone else's interests ahead of his own. In so doing, he is lead to uphold
    the law. That this does not really transform him into a good cop is, to De Palma's credit,
    revealed in the denouement of the film where Santoro basically gets punished for all that
    he's done before his epiphany. His decision to become good means that he has to pay the
    piper. Not surprisingly, it is a woman who de-centers the male bond.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Julia Costello (played by <a href="http://e3.eonline.com/Facts/People/0,12,24340,00.html">Carla Gugino</a>) is also
    fighting for a principle&#151;truth. Though Santoro hides and protects Costello, one gets
    the impression that she is really quite beside the point. Santoro doesn't seem to care as
    much about saving her as he does about proving to himself and to Dunne that honor,
    integrity and truth are still possible even in the face of betrayal. The law, too, is
    little more than a vehicle to explore these themes.</font></p>
