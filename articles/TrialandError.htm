    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1><font face="Verdana">Trial and Error on film</font></h1>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana"><em>By Robert L. Waring </em>(February 1998)</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Now on video, <em>Trial and Error</em>, an entertaining, although
    not first rate film, stars Michael Richards (Kramer on <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?%22Seinfeld%22+(1990)"><em>Seinfeld</em></a>), Jeff
    Daniels, Rip Torn (a lawyer in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Defending+Your+Life+(1991)"><em>Defending Your Life</em></a>,
    which demonstrated that lawyers do have a role in the hereafter), and Charlize Theron (a
    lawyer's wife in <a href="devilsad.htm"><em>The Devil's Advocate</em></a>). &nbsp;
    Richards, who excels at physical comedy, isn't convincing in more serious scenes. &nbsp;
    Daniels, by contrast, never quite succeeds in the comedy scenes.&nbsp; On a brighter note,
    the R&amp;B soundtrack is excellent, as is the magnificent eastern Sierra scenery. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The basic premise is that a lawyer (Daniels) assigned to handle a
    criminal trial involving a con-man (Torn), is unable, due to the excesses of his bachelor
    party, to make a required court appearance.&nbsp; His Best Man (Richards), an out-of-work
    actor, fills in for him, and is eventually forced to carry on the impersonation for the
    entire trial.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The film serves a number useful purposes for lawyers.&nbsp; First,
    it offers inspiration to those frustrated lawyer-screenwriters who believe they can write
    a better script than some of the fare (such as this) produced in Hollywood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Second, <em>Trial and Error</em> offers practical advice on why
    lawyers should not attempt to use their profession skills to defuse bar fights.&nbsp; (The
    participants may hate lawyers more than they hate each other.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Third, the film offers a stop-and-smell-the-roses message to those
    in law (or any profession) who have become so trapped by their success that they secretly
    long to escape the rat race.&nbsp; In this case, a tattooed waitress (Theron) provides the
    roses. &nbsp; Another idea along this theme is that if you feel your career or
    relationship is going down the toilet, visit a junkyard armed with a shotgun and blast old
    toilets to get some relief.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Fourth, the film is provocative in at least one respect.&nbsp; An
    number of years ago, the writer George Plimpton attempted to prove that a novice (himself)
    could pull off a convincing performance as an NFL quarterback in a real game.&nbsp; <em>Trial
    and Error</em> asks whether an actor can conduct a trial more effectively than a real
    lawyer.&nbsp; The answer is a qualified yes.&nbsp; Richards gets so into playing a lawyer
    that he watches Gerry Spence videos for inspiration&nbsp; and even buys a fringed leather
    coat so that he can look like Spence.&nbsp; In one of many scenes where Daniels is
    freaking out over Richards' courtroom antics, he screams, &quot;I do not pose and preen, I
    do not put perjured testimony on the stand and I do not make a mockery of the American
    Justice System.&quot;&nbsp; Richards' deadpans, &quot;You have your style and I have
    mine.&quot; &nbsp; This style includes a creative attempt at the &quot;Twinkie&quot;
    defense.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">On a final note, the film is guilty of further encouraging a
    frequent theme in post-OJ legal films: the &quot;noble&quot; thing for defense counsel to
    do where he or she believes the client is guilty is to throw the case so that the
    defendant gets his due punishment.&nbsp; In <em>Trial and Error</em>, this view is
    eventually manifested in the non-lawyer sensibilities of an actor pretending to be a
    lawyer (Richards), although the real lawyer also indicates that this is the correct thing
    to do numerous times in the story.&nbsp; As I have stated in another commentary (<a href="devilsad.htm"><em>The Devil's Advocate</em></a>), asking defense counsel to replace
    the function of the jury is a very dangerous idea that will further weaken justice in our
    criminal justice system and encourage public backlash against the otherwise legitimate
    best efforts of many criminal defense lawyers.</font></p>
