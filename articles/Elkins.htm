    <p><font face="Verdana"><em><strong>By <a href="http://www.wvu.edu/~lawfac/jelkins/lawyersfilm.htm">James R. Elkins, West Virginia
    University</a> </strong></em>(January 1998)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">I sometimes hear the suggestion that lawyer films coming out of
    Hollywood are anti-lawyer and that this anti-lawyer perspective is linked in some way to
    the anti-law mood that has seized so many of our fellow citizens. It&#146;s true enough
    that we get some rather negative images of lawyers in film, as a fellow film-critic put
    it, you are likely to see on the screen a lawyer who would sell his grandmother in order
    to get a conviction. Is it possible that we are misreading the negative images?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Before I examine the notion that lawyer films are basically
    anti-lawyer, I want to question the idea that the anti-law mood in the country is related
    to the anti-lawyer sentiment in Hollywood films. If the two moods&#151;anti-law and
    anti-lawyer&#151;are joined at the hip, then I&#146;ve been misguided in the idea that the
    anti-lawyer sentiment was valuable and instructive. I should make clear I do not share the
    right-wing anti-law (anti-government) hysteria that grips us, emerging in the form of the
    politically repressed. (The return of the repressed is never a pretty sight!) I have spent
    enough time over the past two decades in travels throughout Asia, Indonesia, South and
    Central America, Mexico, Africa, and China to return with a deep and abiding respect for
    governments in the United States (local, state, and national) that make life reasonablely
    tolerable if sometimes aggravating. For those who demand less government I recommend a
    week in Bangkok to get a flavor of what it might be like to live with government reduced
    to its police function. With less law the powerful have a field day (as if they don&#146;t
    with a full plate in the most law-ful of societies) ...really... isn&#146;t that the idea
    of having less law, so the powerful can have their way without interference? Let the
    powerful and the lawless rule, where does that leave those who simply want to live, work,
    love, play, see their children grow old. No...it&#146;s certainly not anti-law that
    captures my fancy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">How, then, can I contend that the anti-lawyer mood is valuable
    while the anti-law impulse is troublesome? Let me begin with the comments of deX&#151;this
    is his Web signature&#151;a rather controversial participant in a web
    &quot;film-philosophy&quot; forum. I reproduce here, a posting on this subject, in
    response to some of my comments (you will note that deX doesn&#146;t bother to use
    capitals):</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;ultimately, i think that most popular legal films do not
    simply offer us the &#145;sell your grandmother&#146; view. rather, in an attempt to
    acknowledge the populist conceptions of corruption and somehow defuse and demythologise
    law (read &#145;damage control&#146;), they start with grandmother sales as the negative
    against which a positive alternative of the triumph of true justice is achieved by
    following the changes undergone by a romantic and ideal character who is usually nothing
    short of pure ethix in the flesh. in such dramas the Law, more often than not, is
    constructed as the ultimate instrument for true change and the best place to make a real
    difference despite corruption.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;in my experience what most people walk away from a legal
    drama pic or tv series thinking is not that lawyers sell their grandmas, but that law is
    simply interpretation. there are those who interpret it for their own selfish means and
    those who interpret it in such a way as to reinvent the world into a better place for all.
    what astounds me in most of these dramas is the apparent impartiality and under treatment
    of the judges and jurors with whom the actual decisions lie.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">deX is not a lawyer but he knows something about lawyer films. We
    see lawyers cast in a negative light because they are given an opportunity to walk up to a
    line that says DO NOT CROSS/DO NOT GO BEYOND THIS POINT and what do they do? They cross
    that line. They walk across it as if it were not there, as if it were written in Farsi.
    Indeed, walking across it, they put on a casual air (who me? what line?) as if crossing
    such a line were the most casual thing in the world. But we film viewers know the line is
    there; we assume, based on everything we know that the lawyer MUST know the line is there
    and has been crossed. What kind of reality is it, what kind of fictional world does the
    lawyer live in, that permits the kind of line crossing that we see in lawyer films?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Is it not this ability of the film viewer to see the line and read
    the DO NOT CROSS sign and the failure of the lawyer to heed the line, that makes for a
    negative image? Who, one wants to ask, gives the lawyer the god-almighty power to ignore
    the kind of lines the rest of us are punished for crossing? Is there something in the
    character, the training, the selection of these people who become lawyers that make them
    unable to see what the film viewer can see? And how could Hollywood lawyer films portray
    this line crossing in such a deliberate and persistent fashion if lawyers in the
    non-cinema world (if there can be such a place) do not do just this kind of line crossing
    which the lawyer film dramatizes?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">If there is a lawyer film genre, and I tend to believe there is,
    then the lawyer film, must, in part, address the question: How is it that otherwise
    intelligent, trained people can be so blind? And by what measure of magic and character
    have we film viewers gained such acute vision that we can know and see what the lawyer
    does not? We may think we know more than we do. Our fascination with lawyers may at one
    level be rooted in the viewer&#146;s moral superior vision, but at a different level I
    think fascination (and insatiable appetite) for lawyers and the dramas that swirl around
    them (and in them) is rooted in the realization that lawyers engage in the forbidden: they
    go (and get paid for the going) to places that speak of real danger. The lawyer is a sight
    to behold because he knows the Devil&#146;s work firsthand. In the film <a href="devilsad.htm"><i>Devil&#146;s Advocate</i></a> the young talented lawyer is good at
    his work and seems to have a special talent, a way of understanding jurors that his
    colleagues do not have. He is sufficiently talented that he is given a chance (as are so
    many of the talented) to back away from his talent or use it to take him as far as he can
    go. Lawyers know (and litigate) the excess, they see it up close, and cannot spare
    themselves from it. They cross-over and take up with the &quot;Devil.&quot; Crossing over
    is what we come to see in lawyer films. Lawyers, in film and in the non-cinema world,
    traffic in underground matters (the broken, the shady, the false, the fraudulent, the
    criminal&#151;all manner of Id stuff) and make a good living doing it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">This compact that film lawyers and their non-cinema world
    counterparts make with the devil creates good drama. Is it not the tale of good and evil
    revisited? Lawyer films portray the on-going drama between good and evil&#151;isn&#146;t
    this what a big trial is about?&#151;but worked out on a scale and in a context of
    individual lives (clients, lawyers, judges). Good and evil, placed in the context of
    skillfully contrived lawyer dramas, make us edgy because good and evil do not come clearly
    labeled. Good men and women go astray. Those who go astray find their way home. It is this
    subtle mix of superior vision (the film viewer knows who is good and who is evil) and the
    not-knowing (the film viewer&#146;s assumptions are up-ended) that make for good drama.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">There is an element of the lawyer film drama that bears that
    further exploration&#151;power. Lawyers, who for the most part do not have real power, are
    close to power. Watching lawyers, we (viewers) get a bit closer to power (with all its
    glory and its evil) because we know that lawyers are of the people. Lawyers are more
    agent, salesman (often enough selling the kind of medicine we know as
    &quot;snake-oil&quot;) than they are born to power. Yes, a few lawyers acquire it by
    association, money, or delegation, but ultimately lawyers are trained to get close to
    power and know of it without actually having it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">We are all, I think, curious about power: how it works, tempts,
    corrupts, and some, including some lawyers, can get close to power without be ruined by
    their exposure. It is in seeing, in the life of lawyer protagonists, and their skilled
    defense of the misuse of power, and then, in the opposition to power and its defenders by
    those possessed of conscience acting on behalf of those who have been done an injustice,
    that we learn about power.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Basically, we entertain lawyers as villains all the more to
    celebrate the virtue of which they are so capable, yet fail to live up to. We disdain
    those to whom we have held out hope, the spouse who betrays our love, the abusive parent
    entrusted with the care of a vulnerable child, an admired public figure shown to be
    lacking in virtue. We know that without law and the lawyer of conscience, the skilled and
    passionate lawyer, the lawyer who battles as wounded healer, we will have no defense
    against the powerful. So we want lawyers to get close enough to power, to know its ways
    and vulnerabilities, to have become so much a part of it, that this knowledge and skill
    can be used to maintain a more inhabitable world. We want someone, anyone, lawyer,
    political, local businessmen and women, who will speak truth to power&#151;and would not
    the viewer if he or she but had the courage? Power opposes truth and lawyers know this and
    have the wherewithal&#151;sometimes&#151;to do something about it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The thing about lawyers (and they most certainly are not the only
    folks in society who do this) is their ability (if not their practice) to speak truth to
    power and live to speak another day. Most of us know it takes more courage than many
    lawyers will have to speak truthfully about what they know (or even, for that matter to
    speak openly and truthfully to clients when no one but the client is listening). Maybe, we
    shouldn&#146;t expect lawyers to be anymore courageous than the next man or women, but we
    do. The kind of courageous speaking I have in mind is certainly not a routine matter;
    lawyers are most definitely not trained in American law schools to know about power and
    that we might oppose it. Law students are not warned that they will be given the
    opportunity to oppose power and many of them will not possess the courage, skill, and
    psychological and communal resources to do what they know needs to be done. No, it&#146;s
    not a mundane sort of thing this speaking in opposition to power (and those who have it).
    Talk to Anita Hill or anyone who talks back to power and you will hear the same tale
    repeated as mantra: the powerful will try to destroy you if they cannot corrupt you or
    coopt you. The powerful know only how to use power leaving destruction in their path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">We see so little courage in the non-cinema world (where our
    culture routinely marginalizes those who speak in non-conforming ways) that we turn to
    film, lawyer films included, to witness a world in which wild/id/energy can be recognized
    as a form of truth. As an afficionado of anti-lawyer sentiments in popular culture, I
    don&#146;t think we are fully conscience of how much we depend on film and television for
    our instructions on the ways of power and its destructive potential. (Of course, there is
    a counter-pull, an ideology within lawyer films and television lawyer dramas that
    immobilizes us, even as we learn the condition we are in.) I think we watch film (and
    television) to escape the smoothing sense of powerlessness we experience and see being
    living around us. There is, in seeing the powerful opposed and defeated in the world of
    lawyer films, a suggestion that power and its corruption can be comprehended and defeated.
    Lawyer protagonists come to grips with power, either power out in the world, or the sense
    of powerless in their own lives, and that is what the film viewer most desires.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">We see lawyers in film, e.g., <i>Devil&#146;s Advocate</i>,
    succumb to power because the lawyer is seduced by his own talent and the lure of the big
    time/big city. He wants to push himself, and his talents, to let them take him as far as
    he can go. We (viewers) know that this talent used unreflectively is a vice and that he
    will be the last to know that his prized virtue has become an empty shell. Is it
    anti-lawyer to show how a talent can lead a lawyer astray?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">We don&#146;t watch anti-lawyer films to participate in the
    anti-law sentiment in this country. Indeed, lawyer films are not, it turns out so much
    anti-lawyer, as they are an opportunity to participate vicariously in dramas that upend
    our lives, the sense that the drama of good and evil has not been finally settled, that
    the outcome, even when resolved in the film, is still in doubt for it&#151;the great
    drama&#151;must be restaged again and again and again. We do not, and the lawyers in film
    do not, finally prevail over evil by acting virtuously, but by surviving to fighting
    another day. To have and understand our heros, film lawyer heroes and everyday heros, we
    must know the reality of failure and the possibility of tragedy, and perhaps its
    inevitability.</font></p>
