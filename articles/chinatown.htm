    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1>Chinatown</h1>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><em><strong>by John Denvir, USF Law School</strong> </em>(March
    1998)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One of the weaknesses of a legal education is that it teaches us
    to view law from a microcosmic perspective&#151;what rule applies to the facts presented
    in the hypothetical fact pattern. Many films take this same perspective, limiting
    &quot;law&quot; to what transpires in a courtroom . But law operates far beyond the
    courtroom as one important ingredient in the larger culture. For example, most of our
    daily activities presuppose that we inhabit a political space in which the &quot;rule of
    law&quot; reigns, a society certainly not perfect, but eminently perfectible. Some films
    adopt this larger perspective. For instance, the <em>film noir</em> genre subverts the
    &quot;rule of law&quot; assumption, forcing us to reexamine myths about law and America
    which our commercial culture usually conceals. Roman Polanski&#146;s <em>Chinatown</em>
    (aided by a superb screen play by Robert Towne) is such a film.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">We can view <em>Chinatown</em> from two different perspectives. We
    can see it as a &quot;small&quot; story about the experiences of Jake Gittes (Jack
    Nicholson), a 1930's private investigator who gets involved in a murder case and a
    romantic tangle with one of his clients. His attempts to solve the murder and protect the
    woman backfire and he actually contributes to a scenario in which not only does the
    murderer goes free, but the woman is also killed. The foregoing is all true, but only the
    surface of a more interesting film.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">We can also see <em>Chinatown</em> as a parable about reform in
    America. The film takes place in the late 1930's as FDR pulled America out the depression.
    Interestingly, it takes place in a Los Angeles which has little to do with either the smog
    receptacle of the 70's or the lush tropical paradise of many other Hollywood films;
    Polanski&#146;s L.A. is a beautifully clean bright desert which extends right down to the
    ocean. In fact, the pristine light of this desert city plays a role in <em>Chinatown</em>
    similar to Monument Valley in a John Ford western&#151;a mythic stage for set for the
    combat of the forces of good and evil.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Good&quot; here means the populist reformist ideology we
    associate with the best parts of the New Deal&#151;a government of, for and by the people.
    It is most clearly symbolized in the film by Hollis Mulwray, the water commissioner who
    thinks the &quot;water belongs to the people&quot; and is murdered attempting to fight a
    dam project which will rob orange farmers of their land and Angelenos of their scarce
    water resources. &quot;Evil&quot; is symbolized by Mulwray&#146;s former business partner
    Noah Cross (John Huston) a rich, powerful incarnation of the ruthlessness of capitalism,
    crazy in his determination to control the future for no better reason than to show he can
    do it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">We might see Jake Gittes as the &quot;last liberal.&quot; He is
    part of the new middle class arising in the 30's. He&#146;s a snappy dresser in his white
    suits and Florsheim shoes and justly proud of the Venetian blinds which he has just had
    installed in his office. Most of Gittes work is in the marital area, a fact about which he
    is a little defensive. But he sees himself very much in the populist mold, &quot;helping
    people in trouble&quot; in contrast to bankers who foreclose on people&#146;s homes. Yes,
    Gittes is very much the American liberal&#151;someone who wants to do good and do well at
    the same time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Gittes is no fool. He&#146;s a slick character who feels he&#146;s
    really in the &quot;know.&quot; We see several illustrations of his cleverness. For
    instance, we are impressed when he steals the business cards from an official&#146;s
    office so as to be able to impersonate him later to gain access to &quot;off limits&quot;
    sites. Or we marvel at his ingenuity in using a feigned sneeze to drown out the sound of
    tearing out a page of official records from another office, or his trick of bashing in one
    taillight of a car he wants to follow at night. Gittes is one smart guy. In fact, he
    laughs derisively when someone accuses him of being a &quot;innocent man.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But as the story transpires, we find out that he is just
    that&#151;innocent in the sense of naive. Noah Cross warns him that he doesn&#146;t have
    any idea of what he&#146;s really dealing with, but Gittes dismisses the comment. Yet, it
    is his inability to conceive of the depth and breadth of the Cross&#146;s depravity which
    makes Gittes and the woman he&#146;s trying to protect such easy prey.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Part of Gittes naivete is his tied to his All-American
    individualism. He&#146;s the classic American male loner. This translates into an
    inability to trust anyone. Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) begs Gittes to trust her just a
    little, but Gittes can&#146;t. He has to figure out the riddle for himself. When he
    finally does figure it out, it&#146;s too late for both Evelyn Mulwray and himself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The movie&#146;s message is a bleak one. Noah Cross has no trouble
    handling liberals like Hollis Mulwray and Jake Gittes. They think the system can be made
    to work by sincerity and intelligence. Cross knows the real system in America is money.
    Police officers, judges, legislators all eventually name their price or leave the playing
    field. In the end the alliance between capital and political corruption rules as it has
    always ruled. Polanski and Towne want us to compare the clean light of <em>Chinatown</em>
    to the dull haze of the Los Angeles of 1973 (when the film was made) still recovering from
    the Watts riots.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Are they right? If so, our beloved &quot;rule of law&quot; is a
    cruel hoax. But hopefully the future is not a film noir. We can read morals in <em>Chinatown</em>.
    The reformer of the Twentieth First Century will have to realize that there&#146;s no room
    for naivete or individualism . The victories won (the air quality is better in LA in 1998
    than it was in 1973!) are the consequences of hard-nosed political strategies implemented
    by groups of citizens who understand that the internal values of corporate capitalism are
    antithetical to both democracy and any meaningful conception of the public good. Only
    movies have plots. We make up the future as we go.</font></p>
