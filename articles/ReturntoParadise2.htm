    <p><font face="Verdana"><em><strong>By: Khaled Abou El Fadl, Visiting Professor at the
    UCLA School of Law</strong></em> (October 1998)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small><strong>[Editor&#146;s note: The following commentary
    reveals some plot details. Readers who have not seen the film may want to bookmark this
    site and return to read this commentary after they have seen the film.]</strong></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">I agree with Michael Asimow and Stan Ross that <i>Return to
    Paradise</i> is an excellent film. It is beautifully made and it does raise critical
    ethical issues concerning justice and the limits of professional responsibility. But even
    so, the film raises serious moral questions about how we, as a society, see and construct
    the foreign &quot;other.&quot; In this regard, at many levels, the film is offensive not
    only to Malaysians, but also to Muslims in general. It is precisely because the film is so
    powerful, that its effect is particularly offensive.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Throughout the film, as the camera looks over the urban Malaysian
    landscape, one hears the Muslim call to prayer. A connection is immediately formed between
    the unfolding plot in Malaysia and the Muslim factor. The photography associated with the
    distant call to prayer emphasizes the alien and inaccessible nature of Muslim culture.
    Malaysian and Muslim culture are rendered foreign, distant and exotic.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Next, the film exploits the all-too-familiar stereotypical
    construct of &quot;qadi justice&quot; as impulsive, emotional and unrestrained by
    principle or precedent. After the repentant and humbled main character, Sheriff, shows up
    at the clemency hearing, the Malaysian Chief Justice declares that this principled and
    ethical young man has restored the Justice&#146;s faith in humanity. At that point, the
    Chief Justice calls for a recess after which, pursuant to the plea agreement, he would
    commute Lewis&#146; death sentence. But during the recess, the Chief Justice happens to
    read an article which appears in an American newspaper. The movie makes it clear that the
    article is critical of Malaysian justice. Returning from the recess, the Chief Justice is
    unable to restrain his anger, and after a lengthy tirade against America, he reneges on
    the plea bargain agreement and sentences the extremely sympathetic character of Lewis to
    death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately, this is entirely consistent with the stereotypical
    image of &quot;qadi justice&quot; or the Muslim judge who acts largely on emotion, and who
    suffers sharp mood swings based on the particular emotional stimulants of the moment.
    Importantly, it also affirms the image of a judge who puts politics before principle and
    who, like the politics he represents, is volatile and unpredictable. Sheriff, who happens
    to be American and not a Muslim, restores our faith in humanity by doing the right thing.
    The Chief Justice, on the other hand, has a highly political and even tribal understanding
    of ethics and justice. Ultimately, Lewis will die not because of his own sins but because
    of the sins of his tribe ( i.e. the American people or their culture).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Right before Lewis is dragged away to be hung in an extremely
    painful and heart-wrenching scene, the film shows the Malaysian prison guards performing
    Muslim prayer. There are two points here. First, as is the case with the vast majority of
    Hollywood movies, the Muslim prayer performed on-screen has little resemblance to actual
    Muslim prayer. This is not a minor point. One would think that considering the number of
    movies that show Muslims praying, that someone would eventually get it right. Rather,
    Muslims are shown prostrating up and down repeatedly emphasizing the alien and exotic
    nature of Muslim culture.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Second, Malaysia is only about 50% to 55% Muslim. There is no
    reason for the film to assume that the prison guards who would carry out the inhumane
    execution would necessarily be Muslim. Furthermore, secular Muslim countries avoid hiring
    prison guards who are religious or who are practicing Muslims. For pragmatic reasons,
    governments in Muslim countries are always concerned that a religious prison guard would
    sympathize with imprisoned Islamists or Muslim fundamentalists. From conversations with
    Malaysians, my understanding is that the same holds true for Malaysia. In any case, by
    showing the guards in prayer immediately before the execution, a strong and emotional
    association is created in the mind of the viewer between the cruelty and injustice of the
    impending event and Muslim practices and religiousity. Furthermore, having created this
    emotional nexus between the symbols of Islamic culture and brutality, all the inhumane
    sufferings of Lewis become symptomatic of the nature of Islamic justice. As such, the
    film, largely by inference, reinforces the stereotype that Islamic justice is
    unpredictable, brutal and unforgiving.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In summary, I agree that as a work of popular culture this film
    raises intelligent and engaging questions about law and justice. But as we applaud such
    efforts, it is important that we do not applaud the tendency of some works of popular
    culture to reduce the foreign &quot;other&quot; into a prejudiced and ethnocentric
    stereotype.</font></p>
