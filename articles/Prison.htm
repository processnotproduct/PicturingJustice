    Prison Movie</font></h1>
    <font face="Verdana"><p><strong><em>Dr. Paul Mason</em></strong> (August 1998)</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Two dilemmas exist concerning prison movies: first, hardly any
    research has been undertaken in the area and secondly, there has been little attempt to
    define the prison movie. Paradoxically, whilst the genre may not be instantly
    recognisable, there are many prison movies that stick in the memory. <em>I Am A Fugitive
    from A Chain Gang</em> (1932), based on the real life events of Robert Burns from his book
    <em>I Was A Fugitive from A South Georgia Chain Gang !</em>, was an extraordinary film
    depicting the harrowing experience of James Allen (Paul Muni) who escapes the chain gang
    only to live in constant fear of being caught. In a powerful final scene, Allen says a
    last goodbye to the woman he loves - Helen (Helen Vinson):</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font face="Verdana"><p><font face="Verdana">Allen: But I haven&#146;t escaped,
      they&#146;re still after me, they&#146;ll always be after me. I&#146;ve had jobs but I
      can&#146;t keep them - something happens, someone turns up. I hide in the rooms all day
      and travel by night: no friends, no rest, no peace...keep moving that&#146;s all
      that&#146;s left for me. Forgive me Helen, I had to take a chance to see you tonight, just
      to say goodbye.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Helen: Oh Jim, it was all gonna be so different</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Allen: It is different, they&#146;ve made me different. (hears a
      noise and, startled, whispers) I&#146;ve gotta go </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Helen: I can&#146;t let you go like this, can&#146;t you tell me
      where you&#146;re going (shakes his head) Will you write ? (shakes head again) Did you
      need any money ? (shakes head, backing away from her and staring wildly) But Jim, how do
      you live ? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Allen: I steal</font></p>
      </font>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Fifteen years later Jules Dassin&#146;s <em>Brute Force</em>
    (1947) offered a bleak representation of prison life. Of the many brutal scenes in the
    film, the most graphic is undoubtedly the death of a prison informer. He is forced into
    the pit of a drop hammer, surrounded by other inmates carrying blow torches. Naturally the
    hammer falls, and the prison guards need to find a new grass. Along with the tense
    protracted negotiations between warden and inmate in <em>Riot In Cell Block Eleven</em>
    (1954) and Burt Lancaster tending to his canaries in <em>Birdman of Alcatraz</em> (1962),
    the prison movie is best remembered for inmates battling with the prison authorities. Paul
    Newman as Luke Jackson is determined to do his two years as hard time in <em>Cool Hand
    Luke</em> (1962). Jackson refuses to submit to authority, facing unmerciful beatings from
    the guards and inmates alike, and memorably wins a bet to eat fifty hard boiled eggs. For
    his non-conformity, Steve McQueen in the title role of <em>Papillon</em> (1973) does two
    lengthy spells in solitary confinement, forced to consume insects to survive the second
    spell; while Paul Crew (Burt Reynolds) refuses to throw the cons versus guards football
    game in <em>The Mean Machine</em> (1974) realising his sentence will be increased and his
    life made a misery by the Warden.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Prison movies veer wildly from the ridiculous: <em>Lock Up</em>
    (1989) (Stallone does Rambo in a prison yard) and <em>Chained Heat</em> (1992) (Bridget
    Nielsen prances about as a leather clad lesbian prison warden) to the sublime: Daniel
    Day-Lewis as Gerry Conlon fighting for his freedom in <em>In The Name Of The Father</em>
    (1994) and Kevin Bacon and Christian Slater fighting against Alcatraz and the authorities
    in <em>Murder In The First</em> (1994). What follows here is a look behind the bars at the
    significance of the prison movie. First, we must return to the issue of defining the
    genre.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana">The Prison Movie As Genre</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The term 'prison movie' is both a nebulous and problematic one. It
    is not a term used in everyday discourse like 'gangster film', 'musical' or 'western' is
    used and yet most of us would describe <em>Midnight Express</em>, <em>Birdman of Alcatraz</em>
    and <em>Papillon</em> as 'prison movies'. Only Querry (1973), Nellis &amp; Hale (1981) and
    Crowther (1989) have written about the prison movie and none of them attempts to define
    the genre. It is perhaps the difficulty in definition which explains why so little has
    been written about the prison film despite over three hundred having been made since 1910.
    The biggest problem with prison films is deciding how much of a film has to be set in
    prison to be classed as a prison film. As Nellis &amp; Hale (1981) point out:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font face="Verdana"><p><font face="Verdana">scenes of imprisonment occur in all different
      types of...film...like <em>A Man For All Seasons</em>, swashbuckling melodramas like <em>The
      Count Of Monte Cristo</em> and even in westerns, <em>There Was A Crooked Man</em> for
      example. (Nellis &amp; Hale 1981, p.6)</font></p>
      </font>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Conversely, a film about prison does not necessarily have to be
    set in one. David Hayman's film <em>Silent Scream</em> (1990) concerns the suffering and
    mental anguish brought on by incarceration, yet this is not predominantly set in prison. <em>We're
    No Angels</em> (1955), <em>Breakout</em> (1975), <em>In The Name Of The Father</em> (1995)
    and <em>Sleepers</em> (1996) could all be seen as concerned with prison, yet in all of
    them a significant part of the film takes place outside the prison walls. Further more,
    Laurel &amp; Hardy in <em>The Hoose Gow</em> (1929), Elvis Presley's <em>Jailhouse Rock</em>
    (1957) and <em>Porridge</em> (1978) whilst all mainly set within the walls of a prison are
    merely star vehicles with prison as a backdrop. Having considered these problems, I
    settled on the following definition of a prison movie - 'a film which concerns civil
    imprisonment and which is mainly set within the walls of a prison or uses prison as a
    central theme'. Whilst not without its flaws, not least of which being the well documented
    problem of delineating genre , I think it is a working definition allowing a discussion of
    prison movies. Before looking at two specific issues in prison movies, I will deal briefly
    with broader thematic patterns .</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana">Escape, Battle and Riot</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Along with the prison as machine and inmates first experience of
    prison (discussed below), there are of course other themes prevalent in the prison film -
    not least of which is the prison escape documented in numerous films such as <em>Prison
    Break</em> (1938), <em>Crashout</em> (1955), <em>Breakout</em> (1975) and, perhaps most
    memorably <em>Midnight Express</em> (1978). The constant battle with authority too
    punctuates most prison films. Often depicted as a battle to survive, inmate defiance has
    been central to the prison movie. Robert Stroud's refusal to be institutionalised in <em>Birdman
    Of Alcatraz</em> (1962) is a prime example of such a battle. There is a constant struggle
    throughout the film between the Governor and Stroud culminating in Stroud's tirade against
    the prison system:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font face="Verdana"><p><font face="Verdana">you want your prisoners to dance out the
      gates like puppets on a string with rubber stamp values impressed by you with your sense
      of conformity, your sense of behaviour even your sense of morality...When they're outside
      they're lost - automatons just going through the motions of living but underneath there's
      a deep deep hatred for what you did to them...The result? More than half come back to
      prison.</font></p>
      </font>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The battle is sometimes physical with brutal exchanges between
    officers and inmates (<em>McVicar</em> (1980), <em>Scum</em> (1983) <em>Lock Up</em>
    (1989) for example). While at other times it is expressed in mental victories over the
    system - broadcasting music over the exercise yard tannoy from the Governor's office in <em>The
    Shawshank Redemption</em> (1995); deliberately losing the big race in <em>The Loneliness
    Of The Long Distance Runner</em> (1962) and getting Alcatraz closed down in <em>Murder In
    The First</em> (1995). The target for inmate battles is often represented as a huge
    faceless system of which the guards and the Warden are only part: inmates must fight the
    machinery of punishment. </font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana">House Of The Dead: the prison machine</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Central to the prison movie is the concept of the prison as a
    machine: the 'system' with its impenetrable sets of rules and regulations which grind on
    relentlessly. The effect of such a mechanistic depiction of punishment is to highlight
    both the individual fight for survival and the inherent process of dehumanisation which
    comes with incarceration in the system. The monotony and regulation of prison life is most
    often depicted by the highly structured movement of prisoners. From prison films of the
    1930s and 40s like <em>Numbered Men</em> (1930), <em>The Criminal Code</em> (1931), <em>San
    Quentin</em> (1937), <em>Men Without Souls</em> (1940) and <em>Brute Force</em> (1947)
    through to recent movies like <em>Dead Man Walking</em> (1995) and <em>The Shawshank
    Redemption</em> (1995) shots of inmates trudging along the huge steel landings, up and
    down stairwells to and from their cells has been used to convey the system within prison:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font face="Verdana"><p><font face="Verdana">Rows of cell doors open simultaneously and
      hundreds of prisoners tramp in unison to the yard. In the cavernous mess hall, they sit
      down to eat the mass-produced fodder their keepers call food. The camera tracks along a
      row of prisoners to reveal faces mainly individuated by the manner in which they express
      their revulsion at the meal. (Roffman &amp; Purdy 1981, p.26 on a scene from <em>The Big
      House</em>)</font></p>
      </font>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One of the most memorable examples of this depiction of routine
    came in the Mervyn LeRoy directed <em>I Am A Fugitive From a Chain Gang</em> (1932). After
    his first night's sleep in the camp, James Allen (played by Paul Muni) awakes to the sound
    of the chains which bind the inmates together being pulled along the bunks and out of the
    dormitory. With heads bowed the inmates sit with their legs over the bunks waiting for the
    chains to disappear out of sight after which they stand up and march out of the dorm and
    onto trucks where they are transported to the mines to hammer rocks. All of this is
    accompanied by the deafening sound of rattling chains and guards shouting abuse at the
    men.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Many prison films continually repeat shots of inmates doing the
    same tasks which acts both as a link between scenes and as a reminder to the audience of
    the mundane regime of prison. In <em>San Quentin</em> (1937) for example we are regularly
    shown the massive exercise yard filled with inmates; in <em>The Pot Carriers</em> (1961)
    inmates are frequently seen lining up to collect food; and in <em>McVicar</em> (1981) many
    of the conversations take place as prisoners walk either up or down stairwells or from
    their cells. This uniformity in movement not only underlines the highly structured routine
    of the prison but extends the machinery image further. The motion of inmates, in contrast
    to the solid silence of the walls which contains it, mirrors the workings of a machine -
    prisoners are the cogs that whir around, driving the huge mechanism of punishment
    unswervingly onward.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Indeed, in some films the camera pans round the prison interior,
    dwelling on landings, stairwells, bars and cell doors, stressing the quasi-industrial
    nature of the prison. In <em>Wedlock</em> (1990) the audience follow new inmate Magenta
    (Rutger Hauer) around the high-tech maximum security prison to which he has been sent. The
    camera sweeps around the dripping silver pipes, huge fans and metal columns accompanied by
    an insistent humming noise. <em>Two Way Stretch</em> (1960), <em>Midnight Express</em>
    (1978) and <em>Silent Scream</em> (1990) also feature lengthy internal shots of the prison
    while prison movies featuring Alcatraz (<em>Alcatraz Island</em> (1937), <em>Birdman of
    Alcatraz</em> (1962), <em>Escape From Alcatraz</em> (1979) and two TV movies <em>Alcatraz:
    the Whole Shocking Story</em> (1980) and <em>Six Against The Rock</em> (1987)) all dwell
    on their grim surroundings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">As well as its physical presence, the prison film shows the
    inflexible rules of the machine:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font face="Verdana"><p><font face="Verdana">'I know 'em. There the same in all Pens. They
      tell you when to eat, when to sleep, when to go to the privy'. (From <em>Birdman of
      Alcatraz</em> (1962)) </font></p>
      </font>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Although used primarily to illustrate injustice, the hard and fast
    prison rules serve to emphasise the unyielding processing of inmates through the penal
    system. This is expressed through seemingly trivial regulations such as no inmate may
    touch the prison radio in <em>The Ladies They Talk About</em> (1933); no talking during
    hard labour in (amongst many others) <em>Road Gang</em> (1936), <em>Papillon</em> (1973)
    and <em>Scum</em> (1983); inmates to refer to each other only by their prison name in <em>Wedlock</em>
    (1990) and so on. Breach of such regulations is often punished by long periods of solitary
    confinement, a penalty often represented as harsh given the original offence (<em>Papillon</em>
    (1973) and <em>Murder In The First</em> (1995) for example).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The injustice suffered by inmates at the hands of the prison
    machine is used by some films to make political points. This was particularly true of
    films made in the 1930s with prison represented as a symbol of 'the system': the cause of
    the despair and recession in 1930's America. Films such as <em>Hell's Highway</em> (1932)
    and <em>Blackwell's Island</em> (1939) show prison as 'the ultimate metaphor of social
    entrapment' (Roffman &amp; Purdy 1981, p.26) with the emphasis on the brutality of prisons
    and chain gangs robbing men of their individuality and freedom:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font face="Verdana"><p><font face="Verdana">the evil in the men's prisons appears to have
      been transformed into some larger entity. More often than not, that larger entity takes
      the form of a political or big city &quot;machine&quot;. The effect of this was to
      encourage the audience to ... vent whatever animosity they might be able to muster on ...
      the &quot;system&quot; that seemed, to the thirties audience, to control the very life of
      every honest, hard working (or unemployed) man in America. (Querry 1976, p.159)</font></p>
      </font>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The representation of the prison as a machine in cinema is
    fundamental to the prison movie. For it is from this idea that the other themes flow:
    escape from the machine, riot against the machine, the role of the machine in processing
    and rehabilitating inmates and, entering the machine from the free world as a new inmate.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana">On Entering Prison</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One method frequently employed by prison films to stress the
    systematic nature of the prison experience is the emphasis on its effect on inmates. In
    particular the dehumanising process which turns men into prisoners, numbers and
    statistics. This process begins with the routine new inmates first go through when they
    enter the prison. When Gerry Conlon is first taken to prison in <em>In The Name Of The
    Father</em> (1995) he hands over his clothes which are placed in a box by a stern looking
    prison officer. Stripped naked, he is then hosed down in cold water and, covered with
    delousing powder. His clothes are replaced by prison issue uniform and he is pushed into
    his cell. The dehumanising process begins. A similar process occurs in both <em>Numbered
    Men</em> (1940) and <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em> (1996) but versions of this routine
    are present in nearly all prison films. Their significance centres on the prison's control
    of the body. Inmates stripped, examined and washed accentuate the transformation from
    outsider to insider.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">There are also parallels here with public executions. Executions
    at the gallows and guillotine were visible displays of the sovereign&#146;s ultimate
    control over his subjects. This mastering of the body of the condemned, while not ending
    in the taking of it, is present in the routine on entry to prison. Perhaps most symbolic
    is the cutting of the hair seen in <em>The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner</em>
    (1962), <em>Papillon</em> (1973) and <em>Midnight Express</em> (1978), historically an
    attack on liberty and personal autonomy and, of course, visually the most noticeable
    difference between inmate and free man. The speed and mechanical implementation of these
    rules regarding the entry of a new inmate is the first, and perhaps therefore the most
    striking, example of the regulated institutional nature of prison the viewer sees. The
    machine begins to roll.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">This new-inmate procedure has another function other than
    highlighting the process of turning men into prisoners. As viewers, we have limited
    knowledge of prison and hence when a character enters prison, we too share their ignorance
    and fear. As an audience we are subjected to the harsh regime of prison life, stern
    officers and claustrophobic cells. Cinema is aware of our ignorance and often uses it to
    elicit sympathy for the new inmate: the naively of &quot;Red&quot; Kennedy (Humphrey
    Bogart) in falling for an inmate prank in <em>San Quentin</em> (1937) and freshly
    convicted James Rainbow trusting a well-known tobacco baron in <em>The Pot Carriers</em>
    (1962) for example. As part of the new arrival, inmates often meet with a violent
    introduction from guards. Chain gang films like <em>Road Gang</em> (1936) and <em>I Was A
    Fugitive From A Chain Gang</em> (1932) depict guards whipping inmates new to the regime of
    hard labour. While in <em>The Mean Machine</em> (1974) Paul Crew (Burt Reynolds) is beaten
    by Head Guard Captain Kennauer and in <em>Murder In The First</em> (1996) Henry Young
    (Kevin Bacon) had his foot sliced with a razor by Chief Warden Glenn (Gary Oldman).</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Verdana">The Appeal Of The Prison Film</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">If one could total up all the hours of screen time that have been
    devoted to imprisonment, all the years of effort that have been put into making prison
    films, and if one could count all the people that had seen them, one might be tempted to
    wonder if it had all been worth it. Nellis &amp; Hale (1981,p.44):</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One could argue that it was worth it, if only because particular
    prison experiences have come to light because of a film. However the question remains
    whether the prison film ever created 'an atmosphere more conducive to prison reform'
    (Nellis &amp; Hale (1981, p.44). There are perhaps two reasons for this failure. The first
    concerns some of the films that comprise the genre. Those prison movies which used the
    horrors of imprisonment for titillation and shock value, indifferent to any wider
    reformist stance. Most at fault were the exploitative films about women in prison made in
    the 1970s including the Women's Penitentiary trilogy: <em>The Big Doll's House</em>
    (1971), <em>The Big Bird Cage</em> (1972) and <em>Women In Cages</em> (1972). Consequently
    those prison films with a genuine reformist stance are viewed as simply more refined
    versions of their crass counterparts. The second reason for the prison film's failure to
    encourage reform is more political - that the only reason any prison film contributes to
    the penal debate is because passages already exist for it to happen. In the case of <em>I
    Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang</em> (1932), Nellis &amp; Hale (1981) point out the
    publicity at the time concentrated on how un-American chain gangs were and how they
    resembled the barbarous acts of nations given a bad press at the time, such as the French
    on Devil's Island. Hence the billboard poster advertising the film:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font face="Verdana"><p><font face="Verdana">Watch the crowds as they come out !
      Women...with tears in their eyes ! Men...ready to fight ! (Quoted in Querry 1975, p.28)</font></p>
      </font>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Despite the apparent failure of the prison film to change the
    penal system, its popularity is unquestionable. Root (1982) argues that the attraction of
    the prison film lies in something intangible:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font face="Verdana"><p><font face="Verdana">It isn't immediately obvious why prison films
      should occupy such a prominent place with the film going public. Most prison films...don't
      have glamorous locations, rarely involve international stars and usually have very little
      sex in them. (Root 1982, p.14)</font></p>
      </font>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The appeal of films concerning prison lies in a combination of
    factors. These include the 'deterrent factor' - making the audience think twice before
    committing a crime; the 'graphic and extreme sadism' (Root 1982, p.14) particularly
    prevalent in films like <em>Scum</em> (1982) and <em>Midnight Express</em> (1978); and the
    identification with revolt against authority as we are encouraged to revolt with the hero
    against his inhumane treatment: to stop the prison machine. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Perhaps most appealing to the audience is the prison film opens up
    the world of the prison. The audience have the opportunity to share in the criminal world,
    to move in circles of illegality from the safety of their cinema seats. This
    viewer-experience is positively encouraged by the film: the audience is locked up with the
    inmates, hears of the escape plan, talks to the officers and exercises in the yard. It is
    perhaps in this that the real appeal of prison film lies. </font></p>
