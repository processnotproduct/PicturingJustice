    <td valign="top" height="566"><h1>Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills
    (1996)</h1>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><strong><em>by Stan Ross, University of New South Wales School of
    Law </em></strong>(August 1998)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">This is a unique and unusual film. What makes the documentary
    important is the amazing fact that the filmmakers were given the liberty to film everyone
    related to the cases. This included the accused and their family, the family of the
    victims, behind-the-scenes conferences with the lawyers and sessions between the lawyers
    and the judge. It is not unusual today to have filming in court, but I have not come
    across any documentary that gives detailed interviews with the accused and all the lawyers
    and allows filming of conferences of clients and their lawyers and those of lawyers and
    the judge in his chamber. Furthermore the film is brilliant in the way the filmmakers
    present so many different points of view.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">This is an original HBO production, that although quite long (150
    minutes), has little trouble in maintaining your interest. The documentary concerns two
    murder trials and was produced and edited by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky. We are
    graphically shown scenes from the murders of three young boys near a small Arkansas town,
    who were sexually assaulted and mutilated. I found some of the scenes too vivid and the
    production is recommended only for a mature audience and not for those with weak stomachs.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The documentary is divided between the two trials. The first trial
    deals with a 17-year-old, Jesse Misskelly, who we are told, has an IQ of 72. Jesse was
    supposedly present at the scene of crime and witnessed Damien Echols, aged 18 and Jason
    Baldwin, aged 16, kill and mutilate the boys. Jesse appears to be mentally incompetent,
    not understanding what he is being asked, which is evident in that some of the facts of
    the confession are shown to be incorrect. This casts doubt on the value of his confession,
    which we are told, was obtained after 10 hours of questioning by the police. It thus seems
    unbelievable that he is found guilty and sentenced to 40 years.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Jesse is the only eyewitness to the crime. At the scene of the
    crime all the clues, including a large amount of blood lost by the victims, had been
    washed away. Thus the prosecution&#146;s case against Echols and Baldwin is made more
    difficult because Jesse&#146;s confession is not admissible at the second trial. The
    prosecutors rely on the testimony of two girls who overheard Echols saying he had killed
    the three boys and fibers from one of the victim&#146;s clothes that were similar to
    fibers found on clothes in Echols home. Jesse refuses to testify, even though he is
    offered a lighter sentence in return, and the prosecution has to fall back on hearsay
    evidence and experts&#146; testimony. The fact that neither the prosecution nor the
    defense call the only eyewitness, Jesse, to testify reveals a glaring weakness in our
    system of justice. He was the witness nobody wanted to call.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Even with what appears to be little evidence the jury brings back
    capital murder convictions. What seems in the film to convince the jury is the
    prosecutions&#146;s evidence that the Echols and Baldwin dress in black, listen to
    Metallica&#146;s music and are involved in a satanic cult, the Wican religion. The
    filmmakers show a so-called expert (a mail order doctorate with no exams) giving evidence
    as to the power of the blood of young children and that this is an important in this form
    of worship. It appears from a number of the interviews that the whole community is
    preoccupied with Satan. Thus the reverberations of the Salem witch trials (recently
    portrayed in the film of <i>The Crucible</i>) are obvious.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The court-appointed lawyers in both cases are not shown in the
    most complimentary light. Even with a lack of evidence and a not too reliable confession,
    all three of the accused are found guilty. The defense lawyers appear to employ wrong
    strategies and appear to fail to elucidate certain essential information. They also seem
    to confuse the issues. Even with the supposedly poor defense one comes away with a feeling
    that there is reasonable doubt. My rational mind expected the jury to return a not guilty
    verdict because of the lack of evidence. My gut reaction was that they were guilty, but
    that is not how juries should make their decisions. The problem is many jurors do follow
    these gut reactions and do not carefully weigh up the evidence. Thus without substantial
    evidence the three are found of capital crime. Misskelly received 40 years, Baldwin life
    imprisonment and Echols the death sentence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">I left the documentary with a feeling that perhaps some of the
    depicted failure of defense counsel could be directed at the filmmakers who edited out
    essential legal material. My suspicions were confirmed in reading the appellate judgments
    of the two cases. One glaring omission was that the filmmakers do not show us anything
    from the penalty hearing in the Echols and Baldwin case. In <i>Echols v State</i>, 936
    S.W.2d 509 (Ark. 1996), the Arkansas Supreme Court uses evidence from this hearing to
    support the view that the jury was correct in its decision. For example Echols&#146;
    psychologist testified on cross-examination that Echols had &quot;an all powerful God-like
    image of himself.&quot; He admits the medical records show Echols said that there are two
    classes of people - wolves and sheep and wolves eat sheep. Echols also explains that by
    drinking blood of others he obtains more power and strength. The Court gives us
    information that makes the prosecutors&#146; expert witness on occultism highly qualified,
    while in the film he is shown to be poorly qualified. This conclusion is drawn from the
    fact that he has had 26 years of experience in dealing with former occult members, written
    four books on the subject and has been called as an expert witness in three state courts,
    one federal court and in courts in two foreign countries. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In<i> Misskelly v State</i>, 915 S.W.2d 702 (Ark. 1996) the Court
    rejects the arguments concerning lack of competence concerning the confession. It appears
    that only 4 hours had passed between Jesse being advised of his rights and his giving his
    first statement. The Court also says someone with a 72 IQ can still give a voluntary
    confession especially since Jesse was almost 18 when he signed the confession. I felt the
    Court did not adequately deal with the inaccurate facts in the confession and ignored the
    total time Jesse was questioned.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The documentary places the American justice system on trial and
    again the system appears to fail. Although the trial was moved 100 miles away from where
    it took place, the pre-trial media coverage must have influenced most, if not all of the
    jurors. The media, as in the OJ trial, appear to be irresponsible, but the filmmakers
    should also be held responsible for leaving out important material and by manipulating
    some of the evidence. They make a strong suggestion that the stepfather of one of the
    victims may be responsible for the crime because of the knife he gives them which has
    traces of the stepfather&#146;s and this victim&#146;s blood. Even with this criticism the
    documentary is an important development in looking at our criminal justice system with its
    unique coverage of all parties involved in the process. It would also be a very useful
    teaching tool for teachers of criminal procedure and effective in clinical programs.</font></p>
