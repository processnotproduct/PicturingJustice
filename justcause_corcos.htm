                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Christine Alice Corcos<br>
<br>
<br>
                  Pax TV, one of the family networks that specializes in feel good
                  shows, has launched as part of its Sunday lineup <i>Just Cause</i>,
                  a &quot;legal drama&quot;featuring an innocent ex-con who earns
                  her law degree from an &quot;Internet law school&quot;  and badgers
                  an uptight, conservative and conventional Harvard alum and name
                  partner at a San Francisco law firm into hiring her as a paralegal
                  and helping her seek a pardon from the governor. Have you read
                  enough clich&eacute;s yet? The show actually airs on the WTV
                  (Women's Television Network) which suggests that while television
                  may be anti lawyer it isn't anti woman lawyer. Well, perhaps.<br>
                   <br>
                  <img src="images/justecause.jpg" width="266" height="69" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The show's premise is that Alexandra
                  De Monaco (played by perky newcomer Elizabeth, or Lisa,  Lackey)
                  was framed by her sleazy insurance company lawyer husband who
                  then absconded with five million dollars and her daughter. Even
                  after five years of wrongful incarceration, Alex is still perky
                  about life and the legal system, since she attended law school
                  over the 'net for five years and graduated &quot;at the top of
                  her class.&quot; She is such a good jailhouse lawyer in fact
                  that she helps out both the other prisoners and the guards. In
                  gratitude, one other con gives her a cross, which she wears,
                  quite prominently, in every episode.           </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Released on parole, Alex sets
                  off perkily through San Francisco on a search for a job. Her
                  parole officer, a non-perky sort, finds her a job with a cleaning
                  service (this features prominently later in the two hour pilot
                  episode) but she has bigger plans. She approaches name partner
                  Hamilton Whitney III (Richard Thomas) for assistance with clearing
                  her name and eventually convinces him to hire her in a kind of
                  Erin Brockovich position (in which she mimics Brockovich's tenacity
                  and smarts, though not her dress or language). Alex then proceeds
                  to uncover the truth about the death of a corporate officer who
                  intended to blow the whistle on some shady dealings at his firm
                  (the name Enron drifts through the dialogue), fend off initial
                  hostility from one of the senior female lawyers (an Asian-American!)
                  and attentions from both one of the senior male lawyers and the
                  defendant corporation's sleazy counsel, and break through Whitney's
                  reserve by taking him to a diner at the airport (You go, girl!)
                  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Throughout, she obeys only
                  those rules set out by the parole board, cheerfully ignoring
                  what Whitney instructs her to do. She breaks into the defendant
                  corporation's offices with the assistance of her friends from
                  the cleaning crew and catches employees shredding documents that
                  should have been turned over during discovery. She races into
                  the courtroom at the last minute to present the judge with an
                  incriminating memo written by the deceased corporate officer.
                  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">She is the epitome of the renegade
                  hero who justifies ignoring those rules that get between her
                  and what she considers to be justice. This notion has been attractive
                  in fiction, film and history for years, but it makes a mockery
                  of the law. Alex insists she wants to be a lawyer, but only for
                  those folks she considers as innocent as herself, and apparently
                  she is the decision maker with regard to innocence.  <br>
                  Apparently, Whitney has no trouble buying into Alex's crusade
                  to better mankind and right the wrongs of the universe. In the
                  second episode, <i>Human Trials</i>, Alex discovers that a drug
                  company has been illegally using human subjects in clinical trials
                  for a new medication. She agrees to help one of the victims.
                  At the same time the company's parent corporation approaches
                  Whitney offering to hire his firm to handle some extensive and
                  lucrative deals. Their offer is intended to prevent Whitney and
                  his colleagues from taking the victim's case, or secondarily
                  from using information discovered through its representation
                  of the parent corporation against the drug company. <br>
                  Through a series of convoluted and confusing discussions the
                  show presents viewers with the conflict of interest dilemma,
                  once again casting the legal profession as a whole as the culprit
                  which has created ethical rules of conduct that prevent victims
                  from getting justice. How does Whitney get around the problem?

                  He allows Alex to take the corporation's file from the office
                  and arranges to have the police tipped off that she has cocaine
                  in her vehicle. Of course she does not, but the district attorney
                  conveniently seizes the files and reads them, revealing the depth
                  of the corporation's evil intent.  The episode ends happily with
                  the victim making good progress toward recovery, the evil corporation
                  in hot water and Alex ever more securely on the road to possible
                  bar admission. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The show never suggests the
                  possibility that, if a conflict exists, that another, equally
                  competent, firm could handle the victim's case. Such a firm would
                  certainly eventually discover the problem with the drug trials,
                  since while Alex may be bound by ethical rules, the other non-lawyers
                  involved in the case who are not employees of the firm are not.
                  Nor does it explain why, even if Whitney cannot be charged with
                  releasing private information about his client (the corporation)
                  Alex cannot. She has, after all, acted directly in contravention
                  of the rules binding her firm, and the rules that would bind
                  her in any case were she an attorney.<br>
<br>
                  But the law is not ultimately the subject of <i>Just Cause</i>.
                  The series overtly poses some interesting questions about the
                  possibility of reconciling law and justice, but it does so from
                  the point of view of religion, philosophy, and ethics rather
                  than law. Of course it is not the first to do so, nor in its
                  trite presentation of good and evil is it particularly deft in
                  its presentation. The quite obvious symbolic casting of John-Boy
                  Walton as the head of the law firm and the extremely pretty and
                  lively actress who plays the heroine is intended to draw the
                  viewer into the notion that the law can and should be used in
                  the service of good, and that good is something we all agree
                  on. What the show does not do is consider whether a law firm
                  that takes only those clients that clearly fall on the side of
                  the angels will stay solvent. That would be an interesting ethical
                  dilemma for the show to consider. <br>
<br>
                  But <i>Just Cause</i> is really a fantasy about the battle between
                  good and evil, not primarily a legal drama. It is a morality
                  play, with the courtroom as the stage. Since we know that bad
                  guys often get off and good guys sometimes are convicted, the
                  law is an excuse to allow the writers to explore larger issues
                  of natural law and higher morality and ethics. The unspoken message
                  is that the law is amoral and that some lawyers have no ethics,
                  not a particularly original notion.  If this show succeeds it
                  will be on the strength of its attractive stars and its simple
                  moral message, not because of any originality in its concept,
                  writing, or presentation. It seems determined to miss a wonderful
                  opportunity to explore more deeply the role of religion and ethics
                  in the life of the lawyer and the law, the opportunity that a
                  series like <i>The Practice</i> uses to great advantage. It is,
                  frankly, Lawyers Lite.<br>
