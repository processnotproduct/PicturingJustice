      <font face="Verdana"><p><strong>ANALYZE THIS! JOHN GRISHAM'S LAWYERS FORM A MEGAFIRM
      &nbsp; </strong>By Michael Asimow</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font color="#008080"><big><big><big><strong>L</strong></big></big></big></font>ast
      night I dreamed that I was in a big conference room with all of the lawyers from John
      Grisham's novels and we were trying to form a new law firm. It looks like we've got most
      of the bases covered.</p>
      <p>For our tax department, we'll pick up the terrific lawyers from Bandini, Lambert &amp;
      Locke, so well<img src="images/grisham2.JPG" alt="grisham2.JPG (7773 bytes)" align="right" hspace="1" vspace="20" width="213" height="338"> described in <i>The Firm</i>. These lawyers are untroubled by any notions of
      tax ethics; indeed, they won't let our clients pay any taxes at all. Besides, they'll kill
      anybody who tries to leave the firm. Maybe Mitch McDeere will return with his superb
      client skills and stolen money. For our personal injury defense practice, we'll pick up
      the insurance defense lawyers from <i>The Rainmaker</i> and the tobacco defense team from <i>The
      Runaway Jury</i>. They won't hesitate to commit all manner of discovery abuse and jury
      tampering. For our real estate department, we'll join up with those swell guys described
      in <i>The Street Lawyer</i> who never hesitate to throw helpless people out of their homes
      with fraudulent unlawful detainer actions. </p>
      <p>For our personal injury plaintiff's practice, we'll bring back <i>The Rainmaker's </i>Bruiser
      Stone from his Caribbean siesta. We'll also invite his paralawyer, Deck Shifflet, who
      taught us so much about the niceties of ambulance chasing. For general business
      litigation, we've got those lovable fellows from <i>The Partner</i> who think nothing of
      committing massive fraud on the government and cutting one another out of the fees. This
      is the kind of get up and go we can really use. </p>
      <p>And now--we've got a probate department! The lawyers from Grisham's newest book <i>Testament</i>,
      are vicious sharks. They know how to boost the hourly rates (as high as $600 per hour) and
      they think nothing of paying a key witness to testify falsely. </p>
      <i><p align="JUSTIFY"></i>Of course, a few of Grisham's lawyers won't be welcome in our
      new firm. We're inviting them to leave the conference room now. For example, Rudy Baylor
      of <i>The Rainmaker</i> is too idealistic. But after all, this chump was straight out of
      law school and didn't know how to practice real law. I don't think there'll be room for
      Darby Shaw whom we met as a law student in <i>The Pelican Brief. </i>Darby just won't play
      along with normal strategy in environmental cases like assassinating inconvenient Supreme
      Court justices or law professors. Besides, Rudy has left the practice and Darby never
      finished law school. Neither did Nicholas, the resourceful jury fixer in <i>The Runaway
      Jury. </i>Ellen Roark from <i>A Time to Kill </i>is probably done with law school by now,
      but she seems to believe in justice, so has no place in our new firm. <p>
      <p>There will be no room in this law firm for lawyers who want to work for nothing. So
      tell Reggie Love to forget about joining. After all, in <i>The Client, </i>Reggie
      represented this kid without getting paid. And so long Adam Hall; you wasted many billable
      hours trying to get your granddad off Death Row <i>The Chambe </i>and didn't get paid a
      dime. We certainly won't welcome those fools in <i>The Street Lawyer</i> who work for
      peanuts for homeless people. None of that sort of pro bono nonsense in our new firm! I
      don't think Jake Brigance from <i>A Time to Kill</i> will be interested (he actually cares
      about his clients and works without a retainer), though his buddies Harry Rex Vonner and
      Lucien Wilbanks would fit right in. In fact, Harry Rex might be just perfect for the head
      of our family law department. </p>
      <p>So what's with Grisham, anyway? He seems to hate lawyers, particularly if they are
      trying to make a living practicing law. In book after book, practicing lawyers are
      horrible, greedy slime-sucking crooks. Often, they get outfoxed by Grisham's heroes who
      tend to be lawyers who are working for little or nothing, or by untainted law students or
      fledgling associates. While this theme seems to resonate nicely with the book-buying,
      lawyer-hating public, it has worn very thin with me. </p>
      <p>Grisham's first book , <i>A Time to Kill</i>, was quite good. The second, <i>The Firm, </i>wasn't
      bad (although it lacked an ending). After the smashing success of <i>The Firm</i>, Grisham
      kept right on churning out bestsellers, but they seem hastily dashed off. The plots are
      thin (really more like movie concepts). Their unidimensional characters mouth cardboard
      dialogue. </p>
      <p>The newly released <i>Testament</i> reads like a screenplay in progress tricked up as a
      novel. It concerns a cranky billionaire who hates his six children (with much
      justification). He executes a holographic will<i> </i>cutting them off just before diving
      out the window. The will leaves his fortune to a previously unknown illegitimate daughter
      who is a missionary in Brazil. The legitimate kids hire lawyers to contest the will. The
      lawyers (and their clients) are as nasty a group of hyenas as have ever appeared between
      hard covers. An attorney with severe alcohol problems sets out to find the missing heir
      and has adventures in Brazil. That's about it. Save your money. </p>
      <p>Now a will contest, featuring spoiled rotten children represented by greedy lawyers,
      can make for a wonderful book. Witness David Margolick's <i>Undue Influence</i> about the
      Seward Johnson donnybrook, a book with infinitely greater nuance, better plot, and far
      more interesting characters than Grisham's <i>Testament</i>. </p>
      <p>I woke up from my horrible dream in a cold sweat, relieved that I wouldn't have to hang
      out with the scummy Grisham lawyers after all. Most of the lawyers I know are decent, hard
      working, community-minded people, who care deeply about their clients. Most make a good
      but not spectacular living practicing a tough profession in a harsh, competitive
      environment. They are neither demons nor saints. Unfortunately, they have no place in John
      Grisham's world. </font><dl>
