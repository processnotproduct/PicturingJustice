                  YOUR FATE: FOX'S <i>THE JURY</i></font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">With few exceptions, the jury
                  gets shortchanged in popular culture.  In countless trials in
                  the movies and on TV, the verdict supplies the necessary suspense
                  element in the story. When the judge asks the twelve strangers
                  whether they have reached a verdict, we never know whether the
                  defendant will get a lethal injection or be escorted out the
                  courthouse door to freedom.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/jury.jpg" width="145" height="150" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">But
                  the narrative function of the jury goes far beyond generating
                  suspense. The standard trope in courtroom drama is to treat the
                  viewers as if they themselves are the jurors who are called upon
                  to reach a verdict.  They watch the trial (well, the best bits
                  of it anyway) as if they were sitting in the jury box and they
                  reach their own conclusions about which witnesses are telling
                  the truth or lying.  Since the consumers of the film or TV show
                  are intended to see themselves as jurors, they never learn much,
                  if anything, about the actual jurors.  Such knowledge would only
                  get in the way of feeling like a juror yourself.  Thus the focus
                  in courtroom drama is on the defendant, the lawyers, the judge,
                  the victims, the witnesses-but not on those out-of-focus faces
                  in the jury box.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Of course, there have been
                  some important exceptions.  By far the most famous is <i>12 Angry
                  Men</i>, Sidney Lumet's great 1957 drama which is now nearing
                  its 50th birthday.  (The Showtime 1997 remake wasn't at all bad).
                   Another big exception is the stunning 2002 BBC miniseries <i>The
                  Jury</i> which focused almost entirely on the jury deliberations
                  in a difficult multiracial murder case.  Unlike <i>12 Angry Men</i>,
                  the BBC's <i>The Jury</i> seriously explored all the personal
                  problems that the jurors brought with them to the courthouse.
                  <i>Runaway Jury</i> was a pretty decent thriller centering on
                  a juror with an agenda. But what else can you think of? Aside
                  from a couple of pretty average jury tampering movies (<i>The
                  Juror, Trial by Jury</i>), and a dumb Paulie Shore comedy (<i>Jury
                  Duty</i>), and occasional snippets of deliberation (as in <i>The
                  Rainmaker</i>), the movies have pretty much stayed out of the
                  jury room. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">All of which brings us to the
                  new Fox series, <i>The Jury</i>.  Each week, twelve new actors
                  serve as the jury while the same cast members function as lawyers,
                  judge, and bailiff.  (This will be a boon to the NY acting community).
                   We'll be sitting in the jury room with the jurors as they sweat
                  out their decision in a difficult criminal case. Occasionally,
                  the action cuts to scenes from the trial so we catch up with
                  what the jury has seen (we also see some plea bargaining which
                  the jury, of course, doesn't get to see).  One interesting feature
                  is that viewers out there in TV land are asked to vote on the
                  case  (<i>The People's Court </i>uses the same gimmick) which
                   requires us to pay attention and try to commit to one result
                  or the other.  Finally, after the verdict is delivered, we see
                  what really went down at the crime scene. In the initial episode,
                  <i>Three Boys and a Gun</i>, we discover that the jury blew it.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">You know what?  I liked this
                  show.  I liked it because it felt like real jurors wrestling
                  with real cases. They all had their own perspectives, their own
                  biases, just like real jurors do.  They're people from different
                  ethnic groups, different social classes, who would never find
                  themselves together in the same room under other circumstances.
                   And they didn't always behave very well. Two of them spent the
                  night together and violated the judge's order by watching TV
                  news.  One speculated that the defendant must have had a record
                  since he was a juvenile being tried as an adult.  Others guessed
                  about what would happen to the kid if he is sent to adult prison.
                  Things got pretty heavy when one of the jurors accused the holdout
                  juror of being a Latina sticking up for a Latino defendant. 
                  But they did a fair, responsible job, based on what they had
                  heard.   It wasn't pretty, but it worked.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It's amazing, really.  Almost
                  everybody does whatever they can to avoid jury duty.  Those who
                  actually serve (only a fraction of those who were summoned) may
                  be good citizens or they may just be fearful of the consequences
                  if they flake.  They have been conscripted to serve against their
                  will, torn from their jobs or businesses or from their homes,
                  and receive only a pittance for their services.  It's the last
                  place they want to be. They must hang around the jury room for
                  hours or days waiting to be called.  They are herded around the
                  courthouse like cattle.  They are subjected to intrusive questions
                  and are unfairly challenged because lawyers think they won't
                  be fair or because they violate the lawyers' stereotypes. They
                  are bored to tears while sitting through tedious testimony or
                  inaudible sidebars.  They have to deal with their fellow jurors
                  who they may think are complete idiots. Yet, both anecdotal evidence
                  and scholarly studies show that jurors are dead serious about
                  their job. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Jurors are just about the last
                  bastion of direct democracy in our country.  They actually bear
                  the responsibility to apply the law in individual cases, involving
                  long prison terms, the death penalty, or huge amounts of money.
                   For practical purposes, their decision is final. Elites don't
                  make these critical decisions, ordinary folks do. Most of the
                  time, the individual has almost no voice in how things are run.
                   You can vote, of course, but you're one of millions.  Your legislator
                  or your president or governor try to manipulate you but couldn't
                  care less what you actually think. Your life is controlled by
                  powerful officials such as police, tax collectors, or bureaucrats.
                   The jury room is just about the only place where you-just you-get
                  to govern.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So two cheers for Fox's <i>The
                  Jury</i>.  OK, the deliberations got a little tedious and some
                  of the jurors (and the bailiff) were annoying.  But the show
                  effectively simulates real people struggling hard to do the right
                  thing, arguing passionately with their fellow jurors, handing
                  out justice in tough cases the best that they can. That's the
                  very core of our legal system. Maybe it's not the greatest system
                  in the world, but it's all we've got.  The people whose hard
                  work and sacrifice makes the jury system function should be celebrated
                  in pop culture far more often than they have been. <br>
