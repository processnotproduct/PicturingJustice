                  The Triumph of Stereotypes</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Katie Reese</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The 1962 version of <i>Cape
                  Fear</i> depicts a battle between good and evil where a virtuous
                  lawyer must abandon the positive law for the natural law in saving
                  his family from the menacing figure of unjustified revenge. 
                  Alongside substantial legal critique of a lack of protection
                  for victims, the 1962 film reveals patriarchal discourse on gender
                  relations and the nuclear family.  In 1991, Martin Scorsese remade
                  <i>Cape Fear</i>.  His is not merely a revisiting or homage to
                  the first film but is an attempt at an actual reconstruction,
                  or what  Michael Arnzen describes as metanarrative .  Arnzen
                  explains 'metanarrative' in terms of postmodern deconstruction
                  and plurality.  The postmodern effect of a metanarrative is to
                  take the meanings of a known story and to invert them into entirely
                  new meanings, subverting the original message. Scorsese attempts
                  to implode the message of stereotyping in the first film but
                  his efforts are rendered ineffectual because he merely replaces
                  this same message with a modernized version of the same stereotypes
                  of  patriarch, family women, mistresses, and prison inmates that
                  inhabited the first film.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/cape fear 4.jpg" width="116" height="171" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The family dynamic
                  is no longer the harmonious &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; family
                  of the first Bowdens, but now includes the displaced teen with
                  budding sexuality and the dysfunctional communication that one
                  expects in the late Eighties and early Nineties. Similarly, our
                  notions of the terrifying menace vary with our understanding
                  of social stereotypes. In the 1962 version, we know that Max
                  Cady is the villain from our initial introduction to him at the
                  courthouse. When he passes by a woman who drops her book, Cady
                  deliberately does not pick it up for her. Later in the film in
                  a meeting with Sam, he orders twelve-year-old scotch twice, a
                  very ungentlemanly way of ordering.  In both instances, breaking
                  normative codes of masculine etiquette tells the viewer that
                  he is a menace. For a modern viewer, the stereotypes of the 1962
                  film are laughable but the question must be posed if the second
                  film has done anything to overcome those stereotypes. <br>
<br>
                  Scorsese's Cady, although updated in stereotyping, does nothing
                  to challenge stereotypes of the psychological villain or of prison
                  culture of the early Nineties. Even Cady's underwear involves
                  a stereotype. When taken in for questioning and intimidation,
                  police strip search Cady, revealing slinky, red, animal patterned
                  underwear indicative of the nature of a sexual predator. Similarly,
                  Cady's prison posters depict Stalin and Christian iconography
                  of vengeance, and his books consist of revolutionary philosophy
                  and the Bible. The imagery here plays on the viewer's ability
                  to recognize these sorts of academic symbols and reveals Scorsese's
                  attempt to create an elevated villain of psychological complexity.
                  The Christian vengeance becomes an important part of his plot
                  against Sam and is reiterated by the tattoos covering his arms
                  and back, but these are merely indicative of a terrifying stereotype
                  of religious zealots of the South combined with the tattooed
                  nature of prison culture and assumptions about hardened inmates.
<br>
                   <br>
                  Richard Sherwin contends that Scorsese's film is much more complicated
                  and revealing than Thomson's as Scorsese emphasizes the similarities
                  between Sam and Cady in their aggression toward women and in
                  their ability to kill.  Although this attempt to the blur the
                  lines of hero and villain is clearly made, Scorsese ultimately
                  reinforces Sam as the legitimate patriarch just as Thomson did
                  for Gregory Peck thirty years earlier.  Despite some complication
                  with moral ambiguity in the legal profession and reference to
                  Sam's infidelities, Sam clearly does the &quot;right&quot; thing
                  throughout the film.  In fact, these changes and fall from grace
                  have more to do with stereotypical depictions of the time and
                  what we expect to see on screen in lawyers and in family dynamics
                  of the early Nineties than with imploding our conception of Sam
                  as hero.  The second scene of the movie after Dani's prologue
                  presents Sam with a lawyer client at the courthouse.  An interchange
                  between them reveals that Sam manipulated the law for his friend's
                  interests, but the manipulation actually does justice.  In the
                  middle of a divorce settlement, the son-in-law hid assets to
                  avoid fairness and the extension that Sam obtained for the law
                  partner's daughter allows them to privately investigate to protect
                  those assets and to protect the natural law in equal distribution
                  of divorce assets.  Similarly, there is minor moral discomfort
                  when Sam reveals to his partner how he buried the promiscuity
                  report, but, while there is this professional ambiguity, Sam
                  redeems himself by leaving the public defender's office to take
                  up civil practice, thereby repenting of any wrong done in not
                  being true to his profession. <br>
                   <br>
                  Also, while there are allusions to the fact that Sam makes major
                  mistakes and is not the pure hero that Gregory Peck was, this
                  is neither emphasized nor directly shown on screen, and the implication
                  is that Sam is actually a good guy and hero. His infidelities
                  never occur on screen.  There is the flirtation with Lori but
                  he tells her at the car that he cannot continue to flirt with
                  her, reemphasizing his role as husband and father.  She appears
                  at the bar upset that he has stood her up while, unbeknownst
                  to her but beknownst to the viewer, he works on protecting his
                  family. There is relief in knowing that he is more committed
                  to his family than he is to the &quot;other woman.&quot; <br>
                  Similarly, after establishing that only he can win against Cady,
                  Scorsese does not allow the viewer to blame Sam for Cady's death.
                  Sam fights Cady to the death in a somewhat primordial battle
                  of masculinity but then the viewer is not even given the opportunity
                  to condemn him for smashing Cady's head with the rock because
                  natural forces do it for him and Sam remains morally blameless.
                  Mitchum's death is certainly more satisfying than Gregory Peck's
                  Sam sending Cady to prison but the idea is the same; neither
                  director  can bring himself  to truly stain Sam's hands. Essentially,
                  Sam retains the role of patriarch, the unblemished hero. In the
                  end, Sam defends his family at all costs and wins.  Danielle
                  has a moment of mental and physical acuity to douse Cady in lighter
                  fluid and Leigh almost succeeds in her cunning play at getting
                  Cady to empathize with her but Sam is the protector of his family,
                  the successful patriarch and, ultimately, he must protect the
                  family for this to be a legitimate victory. <br>
<br>
                  Just as the attempt to complicate Sam holds little weight, so
                  does the attempt to make Cady more sympathetic to the viewer.
                   He cannot be a true avenger with whom the audience identifies
                  because his is the 'straw man' reaction, a reaction not to injustice
                  but to deserved punishment.  Scorsese could have presented a
                  different legal twist like an identification or actual consensual
                  problem but he did not because that could create empathy in the
                  viewer for Cady.  Perhaps the most terrifying scene in the film
                  and the closest that Scorsese gets to humanizing Cady is when
                  Cady lures Danielle into the school theatre.  The imminent physical
                  threat to her makes the viewer squirm in terror and then when
                  we realize that he will not harm her, the mental manipulation
                  and connection that he makes with her is a powerful menace, and
                  is both more tantalizing and terrifying than the initial physical
                  threat. However, as Francis Nevins has pointed out,  Scorsese
                  drops this very successful manipulation of the character and
                  the audience when Cady becomes an invincible horror clich&eacute;,
                  riding under the car and later refusing to die.  His charming
                  discourse on life and emotion is not, as Sherwin suggests, wisdom
                  nor truth learned from suffering. Rather, the viewer always knows
                  that his prophecy is that of Judas Iscariot, the ultimate blasphemer.
                   And whatever sympathy we glean from the knowledge that he would
                  have gotten off at trial for a crime that he was guilty of is
                  completely negated by the ridiculousness of what ensues in his
                  pursuit of the Bowdens and in his quest to make Sam &quot;understand
                  loss.&quot; Scorsese does not present us with the disintegration
                  of the wholly other as the postmodern metanarrative requires,
                  but Cady is rather a hyped-up, stock horror character. <br>
<br>
                  One of the most obvious stereotypes of the 1962 <i>Cape Fear</i>
                  is that of the image of the helpless, domestic woman. For example,
                  Sam thanks God for the fact that Peggy's innocence and fragility
                  has never been witness to the harshness of the male courtroom
                  and cross-examination.  Scorsese had the opportunity to deconstruct
                  this image of the domesticity but he did not and his film instead
                  perpetuates female oppression.  Leigh has a job but she does
                  not leave the home. Likewise, their luxurious home is certainly
                  not provided for from her salary but from that of the true breadwinner,
                  the patriarch. Leigh's femininity is also a character weakness.
                   Sam refers to her fragility when they argue about his past lovers.
                   She calls him arrogant for staying in the marriage for her sake
                  but there is an inclination to believe this assertion. <br>
                   <br>
                  This is a conflict between men in which women have no place to
                  interfere in the conflict as more than objects. In both films,
                  they are not people but just weapons against Sam. This is even
                  more apparent in the 1991 film when Sam actually has a personal
                  relationship with Lori.  Because he knows her, and even has a
                  romantic connection with her, Lori's rape is directly a message
                  and weapon against Sam. Thomson's Cady uses Diane Taylor as a
                  weapon too, but this is an indirect message without the same
                  kind of menace that comes from entering one's personal sphere
                  and from taking a woman that the audience knows and likes and
                  changing them into nothing more than an objectified threat to
                  our masculine hero.<br>
<br>
                  Similarly, while the dysfunctional family unit replaces the utopian
                  1962 Bowdens, Scorsese upholds the nuclear family by reinforcing
                  the inviolability of women within the legitimate family.  Just
                  like Diane Taylor, Lori can be raped and beaten because she is
                  the mistress, not the wife.  Cady meets Leigh at the mailbox,
                  enters the house when she is home alone and has every opportunity
                  to violate her but does not. Similarly, Dani is most vulnerable
                  when she is with him in the theatre.  When he does not harm or
                  even fully seduce her, the viewer remains terrified but ultimately
                  knows that he will never truly harm her.  Her virginity and role
                  as daughter of Sam make her invincible against the threat of
                  violation.<br>
<br>
                  The presentation of women as victims and domestic objects in
                  Scorsese's film does not even attract the legal criticism that
                  the 1962 film extends. The legal premise that the promiscuity
                  report was admissible is nonsensical as rape-shield laws have
                  been common in the United States since the mid-Seventies. Similarly,
                  acquittal could not have been certain had there been a simple
                  medical analysis of her injuries providing circumstantial evidence
                  of a lack of consent. Contrastingly, the 1962 film actually engages
                  in criticism of real laws prejudicing women.  When Cady explains
                  to Peggy that coercion of her sexual consent through a bargain
                  not to harm Peggy would be considered legitimate consent, he
                  is legally correct for that time period. Similarly, Diane Taylor
                  fears that her name will be published for her family to read
                  and that a small sentence and lack of enforcement of restraining
                  orders will leave her with an increased risk of retaliation.
                   The film criticizes the system's reluctance or inability to
                  protect victims.  Some of these elements appear in the 1991 version,
                  but, without any basis in actual law, they lack poignancy and
                  voice for women. When we condemn Sam for burying the report,
                  we effectually, give credence to the notion that denying such
                  voice and protection for female victims is legitimate.<br>
<br>
                  Scorsese's only real success at inversion is in his deliberate
                  casting of Gregory Peck as the buffoon prosecutorial lawyer and
                  Robert Mitchum as the police enforcer.  Sherwin calls this &quot;postmodern
                  hyperreality&quot;.  Similarly, the opening sequences and uncertainty
                  in Dani's prologue paired with the negative inversion of light
                  in Leigh's bedroom create indeterminacy between reality and fantasy.
                   The entire aesthetic of the film has a postmodern flavor that
                  is compelling but fails to deconstruct enough to become a metanarrative
                  because of its inability to step out of stereotypes set by the
                  first <i>Cape Fear</i>. Stereotypes reinforce the moral framework
                  of gender and power relations, and the ultimate closure in the
                  film with the death of Cady and the cyclical return to Dani's
                  reminiscence affirm that all is well with the world.  There is
                  no inversion here.<br>
