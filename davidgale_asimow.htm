                  LIFE OF DAVID GALE</i> ISN'T THAT BAD</font></b><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I've been browsing the reviews
                  of <i>The Life of David Gale</i> on the Internet Movie Data Base.
                   Most are scathingly negative.  It's as if the critics felt personally
                  offended by the picture.   I thought the picture wasn't that
                  bad and I've been trying to understand why so many eminent critics
                  detested it.  </font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/davidgale.jpg" width="180" height="129" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">David
                  Gale</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is an up front
                  anti-death penalty picture.  It's nowhere near as good as <i>Dead
                  Man Walking</i>, <i>Breaker Morant</i>, or <i>The Green Mile</i>
                  but it's better than other pictures in that subgenre such as
                  <i>Last Dance</i> or <i>The Chamber</i>.   It has a clever double
                  twist ending which is entirely appropriate to the political message
                  of the movie and the personality of the characters.   I won't
                  betray the ending here since many readers haven't yet seen the
                  film.   My wife and  I didn't guess the ending (although a lot
                  of critics claim it was obvious to them right from the beginning).
                    The ending to <i>David Gale</i> certainly was an improvement
                  on the typical one in death penalty movies.  Most of these films
                  end with a gory execution scene; we are treated to watching the
                  condemned (whom we've come to sympathize with whether they're
                  innocent or guilty) get the lethal injection, gas, rope, bullet,
                  or juice.   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Certainly, the thriller aspects
                  of the picture are weak.  The unsuccessful last minute heroics
                  to save the prisoner were absurd and wholly superfluous.   The
                  brilliant parody of such antics in <i>The Player</i> fits <i>David
                  Gale</i> to a T.  The character of journalist Bitsey Bloom (Kate
                  Winslet) was poorly written and weakly conceived and Winslet's
                  acting was not convincing.   Other thriller aspects of the film
                  (such as finding the audiotape or Bitsey's research into what
                  really happened at the murder scene) are also silly or overdone.
                   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But you know what?  In addition
                  to the clever ending, the film has some strong aspects.  Some
                  of the acting was terrific.  I thought Kevin Spacey as the condemned
                  David Gale was excellent (but then I always like Spacey's work).
                    I liked the way the character was written and developed--the
                  long terrible slide from respected philosophy professor, family
                  man, and anti-death penalty activist  into unemployed bum, shoved
                  along by a devastatingly faked rape charge.  Even better and
                  more interesting was the always capable Laura Linney as the victim
                  and fellow death penalty activist Constance Harraway.   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Most important was the anti-death
                  penalty message.  We're in Texas, home of the assembly line death
                  penalty.  The enthusiastically pro-capital punishment governor
                  is shown up as a boob and a political whore.  Many of the problems
                  of Southern death penalty justice are on display here, including
                  inept defense lawyers, endless delays while prisoners sit on
                  death row, hopeless last minute appeals that stretch the judicial
                  system out of shape, overwhelmed death penalty opponents, and
                  innocent men who are condemned to death because of judicial error.
                    We visit death row and watch the clanking bureaucratic processes
                  by which the death penalty is actually administered.   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Recent public opinion polling
                  indicates that  public support for the death penalty is starting
                  to slip as people understand the many practical flaws and the
                  staggering expense of the death machine.  The ABA has called
                  for a moratorium.  George Ryan's heroic action in granting a
                  moratorium and then clemency to everybody on Illinois' death
                  row because of the hopeless defects in the system has impressed
                  many people.  Death penalty films like David Gale bring that
                  message home to millions of people who are compelled to reconsider
                  their position on this momentous issue after seeing the film.
                   By combining the political message with a thriller plot structure,
                  a lot more people will see the film.   That's good, right?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So what's with the critics?
                   Surely David Gale wasn't all that bad, despite its acknowledged
                  failures as a thriller (how many thrillers are really all that
                  thrilling anyhow?  Damned few)  Did the critics resent having
                  the anti-death penalty message shoved into their faces once again?
                   Are they a little bored with it, perhaps?   Or does it make
                  them a bit uncomfortable?   Do they feel that, in these times
                  of terror and insecurity, we shouldn't undermine public confidence
                  in law enforcement or in the good judgment of our executive officials?
                    Well, maybe I'm being unfair here and the critics just thought
                  it was another lousy, stupid movie (like so many they're compelled
                  to endure).   Yet, in my view, the picture was good but not great,
                  and it packed a powerful political punch.  You have to wonder
                  what is going on with the critics.</font></p>
