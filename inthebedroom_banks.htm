                  And <i>In The Bedroom</i></font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
                  by Taunya Lovell Banks<br>
                  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Todd Field's film <i>In The
                  Bedroom</i> reminds me why I periodically lend friends my dog-eared
                  copy of HOW TO PARENT ADULT CHILDREN. Sometimes we are forced
                  to sit back helplessly and watch our adult children head for
                  disaster. Almost from the outset, <i>In the Bedroom</i> effectively
                  conveys this sense of foreboding. So immediately did I bond with
                  Ruth Fowler (Sissy Spacek) and Dr. Matt Fowler (Tom Wilkinson),
                  the parents of Frank Fowler (Nick Stahl), whose romance with
                  Natalie Strout (Marisa Tomei) forms the core of the film's story,
                  that by the end, I was ready to abandon the rule of law.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/bedroom.jpg" width="190" height="130" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">From
                  the opening scene, Field gives the viewer many clues to prepare
                  us for the tragic turn of events. First clue, there is the summer
                  romance between Frank, the college bound youth so full of promise,
                  and Natalie, the slightly older working class woman with two
                  adorable young boys. Second clue, when Natalie professes her
                  love, Frank answers only, &quot;I know.&quot; Third clue, Natalie
                  also has a spooky estranged husband, Richard (William Mapother).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Finally, Field effectively
                  uses the camera to convey both a physical and familial tranquility.
                  <i>In The Bedroom</i> is set in an incredibly beautiful Maine
                  fishing community. We meet the Fowler family at a summer barbeque
                  that suggests a surface familial tranquility that soon explodes.
                  Thus, near the film's end, the tranquil town setting that forms
                  the backdrop for the concert by Ruth Fowler's choral group, rings
                  false. Even Matt Fowler is too disturbed to stay for the concert.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the first part of the film
                  we are forced to watch helplessly the events we know in our hearts
                  will unfold. Then we are left mutely grieving in a darkened theater
                  at Frank's senseless death and the Fowler's loss. So fully have
                  we been drawn into this family that our own hearts are breaking.
                  We have entered an emotional labyrinth.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Field deftly puts us inside
                  the skin of Frank's parents while simultaneously making us spectators
                  to the potential unraveling of the Fowler marriage. They are
                  unable to grieve together, or even talk to each other about their
                  loss. The Fowlers, your quintessential law-abiding parents -
                  true believers in the rule of law -- are frustrated by the realities
                  of our criminal justice system. Then the prosecutor tells them
                  that the evidence will not support a murder charge, and that
                  the killer might even convince a jury that Frank's death was
                  an accident. Their alienation grows with the seeming indifference
                  and impatience of the prosecutor pictured jingling the change
                  in his pocket. The breakdown in the Fowlers' faith in the criminal
                  justice system mirrors the breakdown in their own marriage.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">When the killer is released
                  on bail, we are reminded what it is like to live in the same
                  small community as your son's killer. The stunning beauty and
                  comforting tranquillity of this coastal Maine community is shattered.
                  The killer is everywhere, it seems, except prison. As a result,
                  we can almost feel Ruth Fowler's fear and revulsion, but what
                  can she or Matt do?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As we know from numerous real-life
                  examples, criminal defendants with money or wealthy parents can
                  delay being brought to justice. Money also can temper the degree
                  of punishment. While it is hard not to be seduced into cheering
                  for Matt Fowler's solution to his anguish and crumbling marriage,
                  as a lawyer, I am deeply troubled by the film's final message
                  -- self help, the arbitrary use of power.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Yet allusions to the rule of
                  law, defined by BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY as &quot;the supremacy
                  of regular, as opposed to arbitrary power,&quot; are everywhere
                  in the first part of the film. The law dictates the terms and
                  conditions of a child visitation arrangement that Richard Strout
                  disregards with impunity. Nothing happens when Richard breaks
                  into Natalie's house, nor later when he trashes the house. Frank,
                  with his father's support, disregards his mother's demand that
                  he call the police following a severe beating.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The law, whether in the form
                  of the police or a court order while available, is never used.
                  Yet vigilante justice is not the answer to a criminal justice
                  system that is slow, often inept and too often favors wealthy
                  or well-connected criminals. Director Todd Reid understands and
                  effectively plays on the strong human instinct for revenge because
                  it makes great drama. At the same time Reid's scenario sends
                  potentially harmful messages to a public already alienated from
                  the criminal justice system. The need to thwart, or at least
                  defuse, humans' instinct for revenge is one reason why the criminal
                  justice system must operate in ways that instill public confidence.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the end it is unclear whether
                  Reid is arguing for or against the rule of law. Viewers are left
                  wondering whether the outcome would have been different had either
                  Frank or Natalie resorted to the available legal remedies. Also
                  left ambiguous is the import of Matt's final comment about the
                  photograph on Richard's wall. Did Natalie knowingly set Frank
                  up? The final ambiguity is whether Matt Fowler's final act redeems
                  his marriage or creates an irreparable tear. Ambiguity in a film
                  is not necessarily bad, but <i>In The Bedroom</i>, while good
                  viewing, sends a somewhat mixed message about the battle between
                  the rule of law and rules of the heart.</font></p>
