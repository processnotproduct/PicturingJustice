      <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">by Lynn Wolf</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">In these tumultuous
      post-election (or pre-election, depending on one�s point of view) days,
      we hear considerable commentary by the pundits about the effects of
      television on politics: the bungling of the networks� prognosticators,
      the intensity of political &quot;spin&quot; in which the networks are
      willing accomplices, and even the occasional positive remark about
      television�s ability to &quot;educate&quot; its viewers about the nature
      of the democratic system�its enduring values as well as its flaws and
      complexities. And despite the ubiquitous and seemingly protracted nature
      of the Bush-Gore presidential controversy, this idea of the media as
      disseminators of &quot;civics lessons&quot; to under-informed Americans is
      hardly a new idea. Information broadcast on television, for good or ill,
      does indeed make its mark. Ask any reasonably attentive ten-year-old what
      &quot;electoral college&quot; means, for example, and you might be amazed
      to hear a more accurate response than you ever would have received a year
      ago. After all, most junior high schools and high schools no longer offer,
      much less require, Civics courses, and so the media do supply some
      compensation: along with warnings about the dangers of consumer scams and
      Internet chat rooms, the coolest new MP3 music, and the best new toys and
      video games for the holiday season, kids (and adults) can pick up quite a
      bit of partisan and non-partisan information about politics in America.
      &quot;Well,&quot; say weary parents and other over-worked citizens,
      &quot;it�s better than nothing.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">If television offers us
      its abbreviated semblance of an &quot;education&quot; on politics, it also
      bombards us with what might be called an overdose of
      &quot;information&quot; about the justice system. Programs focusing on
      crime, criminals, police investigations, and trials are packaged for
      viewers in a variety of attractive formats, ranging from the court shows
      of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and &quot;Judge Joe&quot; to various &quot;Crime
      Story&quot;-type dramatizations of real-life criminal cases. The
      &quot;Unsolved Murder&quot; shows offer staged theoretical versions of
      crimes, and invite viewers to assist in criminal investigations by
      providing &quot;tips&quot; about the specific cases being dramatized. Some
      police-centered shows, such as &quot;N.Y.P.D. Blue,&quot; combine stories
      about crimes with insights into the personal lives of the policemen and
      policewomen investigating those crimes. Several of the detectives on the
      critically-acclaimed (but now syndicated) &quot;Homicide&quot; had an
      intriguingly metaphysical perspective on crime and criminals, if not on
      the concept of justice itself.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Perhaps the most
      consistently popular and long-established version of the<img border="0" src="images/lo.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="253" height="182"> police drama
      derives its drama not from the personality quirks of the police
      investigators, but on the entire process of dealing with crime�from
      accusation to adjudication, and all of the stages in between. NBC�s
      enormously popular &quot;Law and Order&quot; is an amalgamation of
      criminal investigation and prosecution; its approach eschews the personal
      lives of its investigators and prosecutors in favor of stories that
      centered on crimes, accused perpetrators, and legal proceedings.
      Television viewers are obviously pleased with this approach; since the
      program�s debut season, it has consistently maintained high ratings and
      garnered numerous Emmy awards.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Is it the
      &quot;education&quot; <u>Law and Order</u> broadcasts to its viewers that
      makes this show such a favorite, or is the appeal located in the
      &quot;ripped-from-the-headlines&quot; nature of its dramas? Judging from
      the network trailers for upcoming episodes, the show�s producers believe
      it to be the latter�which, of course, is not exactly surprising. In the
      past few seasons we have seen <u>Law and Order</u> episodes based on
      familiar high-profile cases, ranging from foreign diplomats involved in
      vehicular homicides to murdered society matrons, art dealers,
      coed-prostitutes and illegitimate newborns. Most of the time, the
      dramatized versions have fictionalized character names and slightly
      altered the situations or circumstances, but the story lines usually
      correspond to the allegations and/or facts of cases whose details are
      already well known by the public. The general routine for a typical
      episode consists of a few rounds of interviews, a confrontation or two
      with various suspects, at least one arraignment, and then some glimpses of
      the private and public machinations of the prosecutorial system. The
      climax of each show often has an unexpected twist�though that twist
      might be quite consistent with the original results of the case in
      &quot;real life&quot; after which the episode has been patterned. This is
      compelling drama�no doubt about that.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The program this week
      (November 29), however, gave this viewer pause. It was even more blatantly
      &quot;ripped from the headlines&quot; than usual�bringing the phrase
      &quot;thinly disguised&quot; to new levels of transparency. Dick Wolf and
      associates expended considerably less effort than their norm at slapping
      even a modicum of camouflage onto the alleged crime, the victim, or the
      accused. Perhaps this increased verisimilitude was deemed appropriate
      because the real-life basis for this episode was a 20-year-old murder case
      involving Michael Skakel, the 40-year-old nephew of Ethel Kennedy�and
      thus a member (divorce notwithstanding) of a family long regarded
      possessively by Americans as their &quot;property&quot;-- the illustrious,
      tragedy-plagued Kennedys. Added to the irresistible Kennedy draw was an
      extra dollop of lurid celebrity interest: the </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><img border="0" src="images/skakel.JPG" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="139" height="148"> murder victim of this
      long-unsolved crime was Martha Moxley, the young teenaged daughter of a
      wealthy Connecticut family and a neighbor (perhaps more) of Skakel�s. As
      in the real case, the charges against Skakel, now middle-aged, came after
      decades of whispered suspicions, as a result of &quot;new&quot;
      information supplied by a former acquaintance who disclosed Skakel�s
      purported &quot;confession&quot; to the murder; the statement, the
      informant alleges, was made during a group therapy session for drug
      addicts of which the informant and Skakel were both members. The <u>Law
      and Order</u> version�in which the murder defendant was also a
      middle-aged man, also named Michael-- conceded the prosecution�s lack of
      physical evidence, true in the real case as well. The dramatic script
      explained away this problem, first theorizing and then proving a plot
      whereby the murder weapon had been removed from the police property room
      years before by corrupt police on the payroll of the wealthy father of the
      accused. That wealthy father, by the way, was not only the arrogant,
      powerful head of a famous American &quot;dynasty&quot; but was also an
      ambassador�sound familiar?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">All this would not be a
      problem�nor would it be at all out of the ordinary for a program that
      candidly proclaims its stories as versions of high-profile cases we�ve
      known and loved�except that in this case, Michael Skakel has been
      accused, but he has not yet been tried. In this week�s drama, the
      character Michael confessed to being a murderer. In real-world
      Connecticut, the case awaits the ruling of a judge who must decide a
      question not contemplated at all in the dramatization (too complex an
      issue for a one-hour resolution, perhaps?): whether or not Skakel may be
      tried as a child (which he was, in the eyes of the law, at the time of the
      alleged murder, a fact fervently asserted by his defense attorney) or as
      an adult (a possibility to which his defense attorney is predictably
      opposed). Should the judge decide that Skakel can be charged as a child,
      the local prosecutor has said that he will likely drop the charges--there
      being no provisions for housing a convicted adult in any existing children�s
      penal facilities. If the judge rules that Skakel can be tried as an adult,
      however, the case will almost certainly go to trial; in the intervening
      years, Moxley�s family has elicited a groundswell of support for a trial
      that would finally bring closure to their tragedy. The reality of a murder
      trial: that will be the occasion when the justice system will run headlong
      into the palpable consequences of dramatic fare &quot;ripped from the
      headlines.&quot; A television show with as estimable a Nielsen rating as
      has <u>Law and Order</u> --watched regularly by millions upon millions of
      viewers-- is highly likely to have been watched by any number of
      prospective jurors. Will these good citizens claim, during voir dire, that
      they can be neutral and that they have not pre-judged the case? Probably.
      Perhaps they will even believe it themselves. Are we so certain that
      jurors can be neutral if they have watched this particular <u>Law and
      Order</u> episode, or even after they have heard their friends discussing
      it? Our justice system, and particularly our jury system, ask us to put
      aside our human emotions temporarily in order to assure a fair hearing for
      an accused person, but, as many high-profile trials have made abundantly
      clear in the last few years, human emotions may be the one element we are
      unable to turn on and off at will, even when we most wish to do so. Should
      Michael Skakel wind up in front of a jury, however well-intended they may
      be, any guarantee of a fair and unbiased outcome in his trial seems
      fragile or doubtful at best, and at worst, impossible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Is there an answer?
      Certainly there cannot and should not be any chilling of creative artistic
      impulses. Nor should anyone attempt to somehow sever the media from real
      life issues., for it is true that the media--particularly television,
      given its emotional impact--have the potential to inform, engage and
      otherwise stimulate people�s imaginations about and consideration of
      crucial societal issues, conflicts and concerns, and even to encourage
      civic conscience and meaningful justice. Perhaps, however, the creators of
      popular &quot;real-life-crime-drama&quot; should recognize fully the
      potential consequences of their power and use it with more caution. They
      might, for example, take a few more dramatic liberties (something they are
      often eager to do), but this time in terms of their of reality. They might
      inform people about our justice system without subverting it--by being
      careful to maintain the distinction between dramatizing reality that has
      occurred and pre-determining reality before it occurs.</font></p>
