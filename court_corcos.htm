            <p><center><font face="Verdana">The writers try to make graceful
            virtues out of very awkward dramatic necessities. They need to
            inform the audience that, for example, an even split on the Court
            means the appellate decision is upheld. They need to create some
            dramatic tension between Nolan and her colleagues, showing that
            she will not be a cypher on the Court. But all things being equal,
            and good writers can make them equal, why not use the opportunity
            to present accurate information about the Court? Why not educate
            the public while entertaining it? <br>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The temptation to compare CBS'
                  Supreme Court series <i><a href="firstmonday_corcos.htm">First
                  Monday</a></i> and ABC's <i>The Court</i> is great, especially
                  since both shows boast talented casts and impressive production
                  pedigrees. Like <i>First Monday</i>, <i>The Court</i> treats
                  us to experienced actors who really know how to get the most
                  out of their material and scripts that confront issues important
                  to all of us. But the ABC drama's premiere highlights some important
                  differences. For one, <i>The Court</i> also includes some characters
                  who serve as outside commentators on the action--a helpful dramatic
                  device that provides viewers with a contrast to the academic
                  discussion that could plague the show. For another, the writing
                  is better than on <i>First Monday</i>-more pointed, tauter, less
                  mannered and cliched. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/court2.jpg" width="204" height="166" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">That said, I have some reservations
                  about the first episode, &quot;Life Sentence&quot;, and they
                  arise not so much from the legal issue presented, but from the
                  behavior of the new Justice, Kathleen Nolan (Sally Field, and
                  not to be confused with the actress, Kathleen Nolan). The issue
                  discussed is important-whether &quot;three strikes&quot; laws
                  that mandate a life sentence for the convicted are constitutional
                  under the Eighth Amendment. Many of Nolan's comments and activities,
                  taken individually, are unlikely but possible. Taken together,
                  they suggest that we will have to take her judicial abilities
                  on faith, because she is truly wet behind the ears.<br>
<br>
                  First of all, Nolan has no track record as a judge, a point mentioned
                  several times in the episode. Why is she attractive to the President?
                  She's a moderate and she's a popular politician (Governor of
                  Ohio, an important state in Presidential elections). Reality
                  check: The last politician appointed to the Court was Earl Warren,
                  also a governor (from California). He was so political that he
                  went along with the internment of Japanese-Americans during the
                  Second World War. <br>
                  Nolan also seems absolutely astonished that she is the President's
                  nominee, and seems not to understand that in order to get confirmed
                  one must convince a majority of Senators that one should be confirmed.
                  A successful politician, as she is purported to be, would have
                  no problem understanding that fact. What is the point? That she
                  doesn't really want the job? Or that she wants it, but not at
                  the cost of her soul?<br>
<br>
                  Certainly that is seems to be the theme of some of the scenes,
                  such as the one in which she objects to making courtesy visits
                  to influential Senators who could assist her confirmation. Her
                  maverick stance is admirable, but it doesn't get votes in real
                  life. And I simply cannot believe that such a rebel, charming
                  though she is, would have been elected as Governor of Ohio. Indeed,
                  Nolan's sole claim to the President's attention is that she is
                  a high-profile Governor, and she would have been elected based
                  on her ability to achieve consensus (I used to live in Ohio.
                  The politics can be brutal-trust me). Either she is a consummate
                  politician, who gets what she wants done by carefully crafting
                  coalitions, or she is an independent thinker, who does not. Both
                  in one person, the second emerging as her true self when she
                  sees the possibility of a lifetime appointment (her &quot;life
                  sentence&quot;) are possible, but seem more like a Hollywood
                  fiction.<br>
<br>
                  The nominee eventually memorizes her lessons well with the help
                  of the President's advisors, who coach her in classic responses
                  to hot button questions: &quot;I cannot express an opinion on
                  that issue. To do so would be to suggest that I had prejudged
                  the case.&quot; Is she really so naive that she does not already
                  know that? Ohio like many other states elects its judges and
                  every election year there is much debate over what judge candidates
                  &quot;really&quot; think on any issue, versus what they can actually
                  say.<br>
<br>
                  Nolan shows up after her confirmation at her new Chambers, and
                  asks her clerks, who are partying late in the evening (a tradition
                  instituted by her beloved predecessor) to help her get up to
                  speed on a case due to be discussed and decided in conference
                  the next day. The now orphaned clerks have been farmed out to
                  other Justices pending the swearing in of a new member of the
                  Court. Nolan tells them she will talk to them in a few days about
                  their futures but for right now she needs their assistance. She
                  sends the two male clerks off to get the briefs and tapes of
                  oral argument and asks the female clerk (Nicole DeHuff) to help
                  her box up the dead Justice's belongings. That they would still
                  be there laid out on the desk seems unlikely. That Nolan would
                  ask the one female clerk to help her carry out household chores
                  seems odd. (Unless she thinks that guys can't put stuff in boxes
                  carefully).<br>
<br>
                  I can understand that Justice Nolan would like to hear the oral
                  arguments on the case, but why right away? By tradition, Justices
                  not on the Court at the time of oral argument do not deliberate
                  on cases. Why create a dramatic situation in which Nolan, a &quot;newbie&quot;
                  who lacks both allies and any history of judicial decisionmaking,
                  has to buck 200 hundred years of tradition? And why present her
                  as successful, in that she manages to push the Chief Justice,
                  in a few minutes of uninspired discussion, into scheduling reargument
                  of the case? Is the point that she is &quot;her own woman&quot;,
                  not for sale to anyone?<br>
<br>
                  Of course, a lot of this discussion is for the benefit of the
                  viewing audience. The writers try to make graceful virtues out
                  of very awkward dramatic necessities. They need to inform the
                  audience that, for example, an even split on the Court means
                  the appellate decision is upheld. They need to create some dramatic
                  tension between Nolan and her colleagues, showing that she will
                  not be a cypher on the Court. But all things being equal, and
                  good writers can make them equal, why not use the opportunity
                  to present accurate information about the Court? Why not educate
                  the public while entertaining it? <br>
<br>
                  Likewise, the writers try, and mostly succeed, in making the
                  controversy over the &quot;three strikes&quot; issue understandable
                  to viewers who might otherwise think no discussion was necessary.
                  Journalist Harlan Brandt (Craig Bierko)'s use of the experiences
                  of both Nolan and the woman sentenced to life in prison is an
                  effective method of posing important questions about the responsibility
                  of society to provide equal access and equal opportunity-never
                  mind equal justice. <br>
                  Many of the plot twists seem destined to be played out in future
                  episodes, such as the exact nature of Nolan's relationship with
                  onetime student Brandt, the &quot;real story&quot; behind the
                  mysterious &quot;Nolan mess&quot; that Brandt uncovers in a trip
                  to Nolan's home town (Cleveland), and Nolan's real position on
                  privacy issues and abortion. As a practicing Catholic she might
                  be expected to be against the death penalty and against abortion;
                  her guarded comments in the first episode suggest the opposite.
                  And, unlike most female lawyers on tv, Nolan has a supportive
                  husband. Like Queen Elizabeth II, who was up a tree in Kenya
                  when she succeeded to the British throne, Nolan's husband is
                  up the side of a mountain and inaccesible when she gets the call
                  to Washington. Of course he should be supportive-it's his second
                  marriage and she apparently has helped him raise his children,
                  but they have none of their own as one Senator offensively points
                  out during her confirmation hearings. Hubby (and by the way,
                  she doesn't use his name professionally) knew she was a career
                  woman when he married her, and he's Catholic, also--two reasons
                  that he's morally bound to hang around. The possibility of some
                  marital tension down the road adds to the details that make Nolan
                  a much more interesting character than Joe Novelli, her counterpart
                  on First Monday. It remains to be seen what the series will do
                  with them.<br>
<br>
                  The rest of <i>The Court</i> cast is excellent, from Diahann
                  Carroll as a liberal colleague looking for allies to Chris Sarandon
                  as a similarly left-wing justice seemingly unaware of the scorn
                  in which some of his brethren hold him, to Pat Hingle as a conservative
                  intent on holding the line against crime. Miguel Sandoval is
                  the Hispanic representative on the Court. As an aside, I am always
                  amazed at the number of Hispanics, blacks and women represented
                  in the television and movie judiciary; it's a much higher percentage
                  and has been, historically, than is true in real life. Here popular
                  culture does us a favor by giving us images of what we could
                  be.<br>
<br>
                  Betsy Tyler (Christina Hendricks), the aspiring journalist, already
                  has a lot of dimension as a woman making her way in a male-dominated
                  profession, much as Nolan does. Her colleague, the sour Harlan
                  Brandt, however, seems furious that his legal career did not
                  give him the job satisfaction he seems to think himself entitled
                  to. He affects a loner attitude toward his boss and societal
                  rules--he may think he's dangerously attractive and inspiring,
                  but he's childish and cliched. I hope this character develops
                  some depth, particularly because his narrative voice is so important
                  to the stories.<br>
<br>
                  With ABC's <i>The Court</i>, television has a second chance at
                  presenting the Supreme Court to American viewers in an interesting
                  and educational as well as entertaining way. The writers need
                  add weight to Field's character, especially since she is so pretty
                  in the conventional sense, and older viewers still remember her
                  from her 1960s television series: Justice Gidget or Your Honor
                  Sister Bertrille both bring up images they will have to work
                  hard to erase. For that reason, I would have preferred an actress
                  who projects more &quot;weight&quot; as the incoming justice,
                  if only to add credence to the conceit that she was the President's
                  only choice for the vacancy. But perhaps casting Field as Nolan
                  points out a difficulty that women Supreme Court justices have:
                  reinventing themselves, particularly for those who remember them
                  as law students, law professors, or politicians. The contrast
                  between her patient acceptance of the Chief Justice's sophomoric
                  joke at her expense during her first Justices' conference and
                  her assertiveness in other scenes makes me think that the writers
                  will actually spend some time exploring the problems that women
                  professionals in general have in a man's world. <i>The Court</i>
                  gives us Sally Field as Justice Nolan, and on balance--I like
                  her. I really, really like her.</font></p>
