            <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Fight lawyerpity</font></b></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by John Denvir</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I once feared that my greatest
            contribution to human knowledge would be the coining of the term
            &quot;webitor.&quot; But now I think I am on to something much
            larger, the term 'lawyerpity&quot; (the &quot;l&quot; is always
            in the lower case and the accent is on the second syllable).
            It denotes a feeling of relief that no matter how much a mess
            you have made of your life, at least no one can ever accuse you
            of being a lawyer.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the old days, popular culture
            often admired lawyers and sometimes feared them. Once in a while,
            they were even objects of affection like good old Atticus Finch.
            But after a short transitory stage where lawyers were objects
            of contempt and ridicule, now we are seen as objects worthy of
            pity, and, worse yet, projects for redemption.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I think that future cultural
            historians will mark <i>Liar, Liar</i> as the first entry in
            the lawyerpity genre; <i>Boston Legal</i> and <i>Courting Alex</i>
            are two current examples. I myself was introduced to lawyerpity
            by the movie <i>The Shaggy Dog</i>, a story in which a lawyer
            has the good fortune to become a dog. Before his metamorphosis
            he was the perfect lawyerpity icon, the fool who thinks he's
            cool.</font></p>

            <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/shaggydog.jpg" width="115" height="133" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The
            Shaggy Dog</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> begins with
            Assistant District Attorney Dave Douglas (Tim Allen of the sitcom
            <i>Home Improvement</i>) trying a big case he hopes will catapult
            him into the DA's job. The defendant is a high school teacher
            animal rights advocate who is accused of torching a drug company
            that uses animals for research purposes. The defendant is innocent,
            but neither that fact nor that the defendant is his teenage daughter's
            favorite teacher discourages Douglas from using the case to advance
            his career.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Lawyer Douglas is not a very
            sympathetic character. He ignores his wife and two kids and doesn't
            even like dogs. Then Douglas gets lucky. He is bitten by a dog
            and the canine DNA particles morph him into a shaggy sheepdog.
            It's in the canine state that he finds wisdom, realizing that
            his son should act in the school musical rather than attempt
            to play football like Dad did in high school and that his daughter
            is a courageous animal rights advocate, not a potential sex addict.
            He also realizes that he loves his wife. Who says you can't teach
            an old dog new tricks? After clearing the innocent defendant
            of the crime and capturing the real villain (charmingly played
            by Robert Downey, Jr.), Douglas puts his career on hold and takes
            his family for a vacation in Hawaii. I warned you about the redemption
            thing.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The current <i>The Shaggy Dog</i>
            is a remake of a 1959 film of the same name In the earlier film,
            the father was a dog-hating mailman; now he's a lawyer. In <i>Boston
            Legal</i>, Denny Crane (William Shatner) is a Neanderthal trial
            lawyer who sexually propositions almost every woman he meets.
            In <i>Courting Alex</i>, Alex (Jenna Elfman) is a workaholic
            attorney who works in her Dad's firm where she is kept safe from
            personal happiness. The important fact to remember about lawyerpity
            products is that the lawyer is not merely the object of ridicule.
            He or she is also an opportunity for the audience to experience
            pity and compassion. Therefore, poor Denny is dying of Mad Cow
            Disease and manages to male bond with his law partner Alan Shore
            (James Spader); and we all hope that someday (maybe in season
            five) Alex will get it together to have a normal love life. But
            these warm feelings experienced by the audience carry a high
            price for members of the legal profession-lawyerpity.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It's not happenstance that
            these pitiful characters are lawyers. It's how popular culture
            now pictures the profession. Lawyers are focused on financial
            success and prestige in their professional life, but this apparent
            success is undercut by the fact that they are clueless in the
            realm of personal relationships where popular culture tells us
            true happiness resides. Yet redemption is possible, even for
            lawyers.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">While redemption is tempting,
            I think the profession should reject it and fight back. What's
            so great about personal relationships anyhow? A Beemer will outlast
            your average relationship by a large margin. And there's no resale
            value in an old relationship anyway. Besides a lot of happy people
            are overweight; most of the other ones don't dress well. Who
            wants happiness when you can have success? Let's face it. Happiness
            is for losers. Lawyers rule! lawyerpity is libel. I say &quot;Let's
            sue the bastards.&quot;<br>
