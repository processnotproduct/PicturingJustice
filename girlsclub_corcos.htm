                  recent Stanford Law School graduates, the fairly conservative
                  Sarah Mickle (Chyler Leigh), the resolutely tough Lynne Camden
                  (Gretchen Mol), and the relentlessly adorable and mature Jeannie
                  Falls (Kathleen Robertson), share a lovely apartment and brand
                  new careers at a conservative, highbrow, San Francisco mega-firm
                  run by Nicholas Hahn (Giancarlo Esposito) and his cohorts: a
                  sleazy sexually harassing type (&quot;Spencer Lewis,&quot; played
                  by Brian Markinson) and a &quot;tough broad&quot; type (&quot;Meredith
                  Holt,&quot; played by Lisa Banes). These young women desperately
                  want to be part of the &quot;club&quot; that runs the legal system,
                  the club that does not value &quot;girls.&quot; The question
                  is, how desperately? Desperately enough to disband their own
                  &quot;club&quot; (i.e. to abandon their sisterhood)? Desperately
                  enough to play along with the law firm's unwritten rules about
                  accepting unwanted attentions from the male partners and clients?
                  Desperately enough to accept criticisms that may or may not be
                  warranted? Desperately enough to accept second chair (or second
                  fiddle) when they think they deserve better treatment?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">David E. Kelley poses these
                  questions as part of a larger consideration of the treatment
                  that pretty, smart and relatively inexperienced women get in
                  the legal workplace. By itself this is an important issue, but
                  Kelley trivializes much of it. The sexual harassment that Jeannie
                  undergoes is now a clich&eacute;-<i>The King of Queens</i> satirized
                  it this week in an episode in which a partner's four-year-old
                  son repeatedly grabs Carrie's breasts while she is babysitting
                  him (at work, no less). Just as she gets up the courage to tell
                  the partner, the little boy switches his affections to another
                  secretary in the firm whose charms are more&#133;um&#133;pronounced.
                  In <i>Girls Club</i>, Sarah discovers that another associate
                  (&quot;Rhanda Clifford&quot;, played by Christina Chang) is out
                  to torpedo her: the associate convinces her that their supervising
                  partner likes things done a particular way, but this turns out
                  not to be the case. The cynical managing partner assigns Lynne
                  to a capital murder case, for which she is clearly not emotionally
                  or professionally ready, in order to &quot;test her mettle,&quot;
                  then causes her to doubt herself even more by revealing that
                  a predatory and manipulative (female) D.A. has complained that
                  she is &quot;infatuated&quot; with her client. The leading female
                  partner in the firm has the nickname &quot;The Praying Mantis&quot;,
                  apparently because the associates perceive her as an intellectual
                  and professional stalker.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Indeed, the associates have
                  nicknames for nearly everybody, including their colleague Mitchell
                  Watson (known as &quot;the Worm,&quot; apparently because he
                  busies himself trying to win over the partners-maybe &quot;the
                  Weasel&quot; would have been more apt), and the male partners
                  and senior associates, known as &quot;dicks.&quot; This seems
                  to be the extent of their attempt to avenge themselves on what
                  they perceive to be the general unfairness of the system at Hahn,
                  Lewis and Holt. And it indicates the major problem with the show,
                  which is that it portrays women who were smart enough to get
                  through Stanford Law successfully and be hired by such a firm
                  as not smart enough to understand that a lot of things in life
                  and the workplace are unfair, and that very few people, even
                  those with enough power and influence to stand up to the wrongdoers,
                  will step up to the plate to right that unfairness. In addition,
                  has school taught these women nothing? Did they not check out
                  the reputation of the firm before they accepted offers? Where
                  did they learn that snapping back at hiring partners is acceptable
                  after a month on the job (if ever)? I have on occasion run into
                  students who think that disrespect toward their professors is
                  a constitutionally protected right-whatever academic dean in
                  charge of students at the time soon disabuses them of that notion
                  and whatever career services professionals are in the building
                  let them know that such behavior on the job leads not to a job
                  offer but to a pink slip.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The enduring problem that Mickle,
                  Camden and Falls face is a simple one: does one burrow into the
                  system and try to change it from within, or does one walk away
                  and try to change it from without, while maintaining the moral
                  high ground? These young women want to have it both ways: they
                  want to be part of the club before they have paid their dues,
                  and they want to change the club even though they are in the
                  minority and don't have the votes. They have, in effect, the
                  same attitude as does Ally McBeal, and they run into the same
                  problems.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Now, Lynne, Sarah and Jeannie
                  actually do have some engaging and attractive characteristics.
                  They are loyal to one another. They are committed to the practice
                  of law (even if they still haven't quite figured out how it squares
                  with the practice of life). They dress nicely (probably too nicely
                  for first year associates still paying off law school debt).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Of course some of the things
                  that happen in the first episode of <i>Girls Club</i> are both
                  ugly and realistic. Some associates do try to sabotage their
                  colleagues. Some male partners are unrepentant, testosterone-soaked
                  sharks who see every XX that comes through their doors as juicy
                  prey. Some female partners have developed carapaces and philosophies
                  that rival those of 100-year-old desert tortoises. Some partners
                  do set new associates up to fail. But all in the same law firm
                  within one month? Yikes. I don't demand absolute truth from my
                  television shows, but so much fantasy is off-putting. The deck
                  is so completely stacked against this trio of professional minnows
                  that they're unlikely to make it through another week in these
                  predator-infested waters, never mind the three or four years
                  it takes for a law firm to make back its initial investment in
                  a new associate.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Maybe that explains all the
                  whining. Sarah is upset when, rather than firing her over some
                  highly inappropriate and gay-bashing comments she makes to Rhanda,
                  Hahn sentences her to ten weekends of therapy and anger management.
                  She insists to her roommates that she is not homophobic-well,
                  perhaps, but anyone who uses a derogatory term referring to gender
                  in the context of a professional conversation (even an angry
                  one) loses the presumption of innocence. Lynne vows that Hahn
                  won't make her cry and she tells him so, leading with her brave
                  little chin. Does she think she is standing up to him, and that
                  he doesn't &quot;get it&quot;? Cute. And why is she standing
                  up to him? Yes, he assigned her to what he thought was a losing
                  case. But why, after rehearsing her opening for days, does she
                  panic and completely forget it? Lucky for her and Sarah, both
                  Hahn and Holt are grownups who won't hold their childishness
                  against them until there's simply no other choice.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Jeannie has a more significant
                  problem, and one that is not of her own making. One of the male
                  partners is harassing her, and making his desire for her extremely
                  obvious. Why does Jeannie fail to confront him? Far from demonstrating
                  her wimpiness, this failure actually shows that even though she
                  is surprised and upset, she, unlike her friends, has some political
                  savvy. Confronting him without having lined up some assistance
                  from other partners in the firm and some witnesses to his behavior
                  is just foolhardy. It is a career-ender. She would be fired.
                  No other law firm, having notice of the reason (and any other
                  law firm would certainly manage to uncover the reason), would
                  hire her. The presumption of innocence here is with the male
                  partner, not with her. How can she address the problem? Either
                  Meredith Holt or Nicholas Hahn seems to be the best bet to assist
                  with Jeannie's complaint. While Hahn might seem to want total
                  obedience and total silence from the associates, his subdued
                  and careful explanation of the death of Lynne's client indicates
                  that he is not a monster. Holt may seem tough as nails, but she
                  does offer the girls some useful advice: &quot;close your door
                  if you're going to gossip&quot;; &quot;don't make enemies out
                  of people who bear you no ill-will&quot;; and &quot;don't call
                  your colleagues names.&quot; This is the kind of advice our mothers
                  have always given us, and even if Holt is not a den mother and
                  doesn't see herself as one, she still seems to believe that part
                  of her role as a name partner is to shepherd this clueless group,
                  who seem never to have heard of Betty Friedan or Simone de Beauvoir
                  or the fight they championed, through what remains of the social
                  and political land mines facing the feminist infantry.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">That the heroines of the show
                  spend a lot of time writing briefs and doing research is realistic,
                  and I'm glad to see that the &quot;grunt work&quot; of lawyering
                  has some prominence. But a good deal of the plot is just weak,
                  and serves to put the women in peril for no other reason than
                  the custom that we apparently can never see capable and successful
                  women lawyers on television. Lynne is doing well with her case
                  until her supervising partner tells her of a nasty remark made
                  by the D.A. Assuming that he finds it necessary to tell her,
                  why doesn't he assure her that he doesn't believe it? Why doesn't
                  he sit second chair with her, once he realizes that the D.A.
                  is worried about losing, Lynne is rattled, and that this client
                  actually has a chance? It is a capital murder trial, after all.
                  Rainmaking is extremely important in law firms. If Sarah really
                  has brought in the client over whom she and Rhanda are bickering,
                  is it likely that the partners will fail to recognize that, especially
                  since the client may have something to say about his/her representation
                  at the firm? Her partner assigns Jeannie to an ugly and frivolous
                  suit against a hapless physician because the complainant is the
                  sister of another partner. Why not just take the case himself
                  and quietly dispose of it as a favor to his colleague (especially
                  since Jeannie could so easily have mishandled the situation)?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As I have noted, Sarah and
                  Lynne, and to some extent Jeannie, just &quot;don't get it&quot;--
                  unlike Mitchell Watson, who tells Sarah to &quot;look for a lateral&quot;
                  move before she gets fired. He sees the handwriting on her wall
                  and is generous enough to share it with her. I don't see any
                  ulterior motives in his frank assessment of her position. What
                  I see is political astuteness and some free advice. Here's my
                  free advice to David E. Kelley: either explain to us how such
                  relentlessly silly women got hired in the first place (their
                  looks can't totally account for that, and I am not convinced
                  by the repeated comments by the partners to these associates
                  that in spite of the criticism they actually are capable), and
                  account for the law firm's continuing success in the face of
                  such obvious mis-management, or give the Trendy Trio brain and
                  personality transplants. Get them with the program, or get them
                  to their own law firm, where they will sink or swim-very likely
                  the former, just like this show.</font></p>
