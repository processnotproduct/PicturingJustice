                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Judge J. Howard Sundermann<br>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There are so many good legal
                  films made, why does it seem impossible to make a good one about
                  domestic relations lawyers?  The recent <i>Intolerable Cruelty</i>
                  was a disaster and <i>Laws of Attraction</i> is no better.  <i>Kramer
                  v. Kramer</i> was an excellent film but it was really more about
                  the relationship between the father and his son than about the
                  attorneys and legal issues in the case.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/attraction.jpg" width="114" height="168" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><i>Laws of Attraction</i> is the
                  classic Hollywood romantic comedy formula, where two people seem
                  to hate each other at the beginning of the movie, but slowly
                  discover that they are in love by the end of the film.  It seems
                  to be modeled loosely on the old film <i>Adam's Rib</i> with
                  Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, but is not nearly as good.<br>
<br>
                  In <i>Laws of Attraction</i> the two main characters are both
                  divorce lawyers on opposite sides of various cases.  Pierce Brosnan
                  as Daniel Rafferty is raffish and relaxed and never seems to
                  have his tie on properly.  He does his part reasonably well given
                  this script.  But the usually reliable Julian Moore, who is good
                  in dramatic roles, is miscast and seems ill suited to comedy.
                   She plays an uptight attorney and seems none too bright for
                  someone who is introduced as having finished first in her class
                  at Yale.  She seems closer to Elle Woods in <i>Legally Blonde</i>
                  than the Hepburn character in <i>Adam's Rib</i>.<br>
<br>
                  The plot is that these seemingly ill matched people oppose each
                  other in court, but at some point go out together and get totally
                  drunk.  In the morning they wake up and find that they are married.
                   They are presented as getting along well for a while, but then
                  a small incident persuades the Moore character that she wants
                  to get a divorce of their own. <br>
<br>
                  The filmmaker try's to spice up an otherwise dull screenplay
                  with locations and side characters.  For some unexplained reason,
                  Brosnan, the top-notch divorce lawyer in New York, has his office
                  over a Chinese restaurant in China Town.  The two also make a
                  trip to a castle in Ireland, but neither location helps much.
                   One side character is good, Francis Fisher as Moore's mother.
                   She is a vain ex-beauty who when asked if she is really fifty
                  six years old replies, &quot;Parts of me are.&quot;  The two
                  primary divorce clients, one a rock star and the other a dress
                  designer, are just annoying. <br>
<br>

                  blockbusters.  <i>    <br>
