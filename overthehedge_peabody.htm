                  Hedge</i></font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Bruce Peabody</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There are several reasons why
                  you might squirm while watching <i>Over the Hedge</i> (2006).
                  It might be the cacophony of sound that accompanies the film,
                  including the grating voices of the animal protagonists, the
                  shrill replies of their human nemeses, and the constant beeping,
                  whirring, and grinding of suburban technology run amok.  It might
                  be the five year old next to you, shifting to get a better view,
                  or noisily playing with the swinging theater seats.  Or, perhaps
                  you might find yourself unsettled by the film's disturbing echo
                  of cautionary themes first sounded by Jean Jacques Rousseau in
                  the eighteenth century.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Rousseau's writings celebrated
                  what he depicted as the simplicity and basic goodness of the
                  indigenous societies of America and Africa, while lamenting the
                  corruption and venality of civil society.  &quot;Man is born
                  free,&quot; Rousseau famously suggested, and &quot;yet everywhere
                  he is in chains.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/over the hedge.jpg" width="119" height="156" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Over
                  the Hedge</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> portrays
                  a similarly stark dichotomy between the pastoral existence of
                  animals - limited in their goals (largely eating and hibernating)
                  and requiring few means to achieve these ends - and the complex,
                  frenetic, and vacant lives of the film's human characters.  Dividing
                  these two worlds is &quot;the hedge:&quot; a literal, explicit
                  barrier between a pre-society &quot;state of nature&quot; and
                  the contemporary social order.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The hedge is a partition, but
                  it also represents a choice - an invitation to consider what
                  way of life, individual character, and personal attributes we
                  might wish to adopt.  And it is here that the comparisons between
                  <i>Over the Hedge</i> and Rousseau become most interesting. 
                  For both the philosopher and the film that resonates with his
                  ideas make a somewhat surprising choice: ultimately forsaking
                  both the perceived excess and immorality of society and the simplicity
                  and relative isolation of the state of nature. In Rousseau's
                  case, the law serves as the vital medium for promoting a kind
                  of &quot;third way,&quot; based on articulating and enforcing
                  the common interest or &quot;general will&quot; of society, in
                  a  manner that allows citizens to be both virtuous and social,
                  distinctively human yet uncorrupted.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Rousseau, like other thinkers
                  of his era, invited his readers to imagine a &quot;state of nature&quot;
                  before society, before culture, before technology or trade. 
                  According to Rousseau, humans in this state, like other animals,
                  operate &quot;antecedent to reason.&quot;  They are also isolated
                  from one another, possess little imagination, have no sense of
                  property or time.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Although these might not seem
                  to be most obvious preconditions for enjoying the good life,
                  to Rousseau these elements served as the foundation for an existence
                  that was peaceful, free, equal, and decent.  A person in the
                  state of nature &quot;lives within himself&quot; - he or she
                  is not preoccupied by reputation or the &quot;opinion of others.&quot;
                   Individuals are free and equal prior to society, because they
                  are physically and psychologically unburdened.  Their wants are
                  few and easily satisfied, and they are largely ignorant of the
                  existence or fortune of others.  When those in the state of nature
                  do interact, Rousseau tells us, they possess a pre-rational instinct
                  of &quot;pity&quot; or compassion that induces them to avoid
                  causing suffering.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Over the Hedge</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> begins with a group of animals who
                  live in a world with many of the characteristics of Rousseau's
                  natural state.  Awakening from their five month hibernation,
                  the motley group instinctually begins hoarding roots, nuts, and
                  whatever other morsels they can gather around them.  In short
                  order, they encounter RJ, the raccoon, who urges them to turn
                  from their simplicity to the wonders that lie over the hedge.
                   The turtle, Verne, immediately experiences a &quot;tingling&quot;
                  in his tail, warning him of the dangers associated with both
                  RJ and his promise of unbounded bounty.  But Verne is unable
                  to articulate his misgivings further, and the other animals are
                  swayed by RJ's reasoned, honeyed promises.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So, with Verne sputtering and
                  objecting all the way, the group passes through the once forbidding
                  and fearful hedge and enters a new housing development on the
                  other side: El Rancho Camelot Estates.  As RJ unctuously puts
                  it, &quot;what was once mere wilderness is now 54 acres of man
                  made, manicured, air conditioned paradise.  Welcome to suburbia,
                  the gateway to the good life.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But is it?  According to Rousseau,
                  civilization comes with great costs.  Indeed, the cultivation
                  of reason, language, technology, commerce, and other forms of
                  &quot;progress&quot; that accompany and usher in society, contribute
                  to a physical, emotional, and moral degradation of our species.
                   The &quot;sociable man&quot; lives only &quot;in the opinions
                  of others&quot; with the result that we become preoccupied with
                  status, wealth, and property - not for the contentment they produce,
                  but for how they temporarily quench our &quot;burning desire
                  to be talked about.&quot;  In civil society, we overindulge to
                  demonstrate our wealth and implicit superiority, and, as we become
                  increasingly dependent upon the specialized skills and services
                  of others, our bodies and souls turn &quot;feeble, timid, servile&#133;soft.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The degenerating effects of
                  society, observed by Rousseau are rendered vividly in <i>Over
                  the Hedge</i>.  As the animals first step into the sprawling
                  suburban subdivision, they encounter Gladys, a hideous, gorgon-like
                  figure who communicates in screeching commands to the cell phone
                  adhered to her ear.  As president of the home owner's association
                  she is obsessed with the appearance of her compound, and, consequently,
                  the misdeeds of neighbors who do not follow a strict real estate
                  code that ensures uniformity of appearance.  Gladys is a restless,
                  despicable figure who conjures forth Rousseau's image of a &quot;civilized&quot;
                  people who are &quot;endlessly&quot; tormented in their &quot;search
                  of ever more laborious occupations.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In general, the humans in <i>Over
                  the Hedge</i> have lost their harmonious connection to nature,
                  and instead strive to conquer and reshape it.  Their homes and
                  lawns are coarsely landscaped, and full of implements and machines
                  to keep nature at bay and in submission.  Poisons, pesticides,
                  traps, and bug zappers recur throughout the film, and a professional
                  exterminator is a major (and villainous) figure.  Just as with
                  Rousseau, these efforts to keep nature at a distance take a toll
                  on the vigor and health of humans.  Consider the following exchange
                  as RJ acquaints his companions with basic features of their new
                  world: </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">RJ: <i>That is an S.U.V; humans
                  ride in them because they are slowly losing their ability to
                  walk.</i></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Lew the Porcupine: <i>Wow it's
                  huge! </i></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Hammy the Squirrel: <i>How
                  many people fit in there? </i></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">RJ: <i>Usually, one.</i></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Society's inversion of what
                  Rousseau called the healthful, &quot;simple&#133;and solitary
                  way of life that nature ordained for us&quot; is perhaps seen
                  most consistently in <i>Over the Hedge</i>'s satirical depiction
                  of food and its consumption.  Rousseau marveled at the degree
                  to which pre-social humans could readily satisfy their hunger
                  and other appetites in a manner compatible with their fitness
                  and vitality.  In contrast, Rousseau observed his contemporaries
                  indulging in &quot;over-elaborate foods&#133;which inflame and
                  overwhelm them with indigestion.&quot;  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">These dynamics are neatly captured
                  in <i>Over the Hedge</i> by the sly raccoon, who observes that
                  while the animals &quot;eat to live&quot; the humans &quot;live
                  to eat!&quot;  Humans, RJ explains, spend an enormous amount
                  of energy procuring, transporting, processing, preparing, and
                  throwing away food.  Gesturing, respectively, to an antacid tablet
                  and a treadmill he remarks: </font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">&quot;That's what they eat
                  when they've eaten too much food&#133;[and] that gets rid of
                  the guilt so they can eat more food.  So, you think they have
                  enough? Well, they don't. For humans, enough is never enough!
                  And what do they do with the stuff they don't eat? They put it
                  in gleaming silver cans, just for us!&quot;</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The animals of <i>Over the
                  Hedge</i> are not themselves immune from the polluting effects
                  of civilization.  As noted, RJ is conniving, false, and selfish
                  in his efforts to save himself.  Hammy, the hyperkinetic squirrel,
                  and the others are smitten by the taste of donuts, Girl Scout
                  cookies, cheese dust, and other admitted &quot;junk.&quot;  And
                  in the context of society, even Verne, dismayed by RJ's charisma
                  and influence over the group, becomes jealous, and dismisses
                  his friends as being &quot;too stupid and na&iuml;ve&quot; to
                  see through the raccoon's designs.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">To this point, both Rousseau
                  and <i>Over the Hedge</i> seem inclined to the following conclusion:
                  while there exists a clear dividing line between nature and society,
                  our traditional understanding of which order is more moral and
                  &quot;civilized&quot; is simply wrong.  The invited implication
                  seems to be that we ought retreat to a simpler, less ordered
                  existence, purged of the taint of human culture.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But <i>Over the Hedge</i> follows
                  this path only to a point.  Upon uncovering RJ's deceit, the
                  other animals do not abandon him to the wrong side of the hedge
                  (and certain annihilation).  Instead, they decide to protect
                  and save him, in part by utilizing some of the very technologies
                  (sophisticated animal traps, the exterminator's van, and even
                  caffeinated soda) and distinctive traits (rationality) associated
                  with civilization.  The animals survive by pluck, planning, and
                  co-opting society's conditions and creations - not by atavism.
                  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By the film's conclusion, the
                  animals retreat back to the state of nature, but they are changed.
                   Their family (albeit an unconventional one based on affection
                  and choice not biology) remains the basis for a grounded moral
                  order, but now it includes RJ, a figure inextricably linked with
                  the world of humans and the creations and institutions of society.
                   Indeed, the very last scene of the film depicts RJ teaching
                  his children how to raid food from a candy dispensing machine
                  - perpetuating his reliance on the manufactures of civilization,
                  but at least within the safe confines of his expanded family
                  unit.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Rousseau, on the other hand,
                  calls for us to erect an entirely new community in which &quot;the
                  advantages of a state of nature would be combined with the advantages
                  of social life.&quot;  He believes that it is possible to refine
                  and use the characteristics, talents, and tools that make us
                  distinctively human - reason, speech, agriculture, morality,
                  self-consciousness, enduring relationships - without losing our
                  humanity. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But how do we steer a middle
                  course?  Rousseau's answer is construct a social and political
                  order based on what he calls the &quot;general will&quot; - the
                  genuinely common interests of the citizens.  For Rousseau, the
                  best form of government is one that passes laws that are recognized
                  by the people as being freely chosen and of their own authorship.
                   And this will only occur if the law actually embodies the general
                  will - as opposed to representing the mere aggregation of different
                  and divided individual interests, passions, and factions (what
                  Rousseau calls &quot;the will of all&quot;).  By adhering to
                  and recognizing law based on the general will, we can be &quot;forced
                  to be free:&quot; free because we are no longer enslaved by the
                  artificial wants of others; forced because our own, private,
                  narrow interest incline us to want a different, particularized
                  set of policies that favor us.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But the general will can only
                  be discovered when a nation sets aside its petty and disparate
                  interests, deliberates, and comes to recognize and experience
                  collective needs.  In Rousseau's account, it is law that serves
                  as the essential conduit, expression, and enforcer of the general
                  will.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So what are we to make of all
                  this?  To some degree we recognize the potential social ills
                  posed by Rousseau and <i>Over the Hedge</i>, and we embrace their
                  respective &quot;solutions:&quot; attempting to delineate a general
                  good through our politics and law, and identifying the family
                  as a special forum for cultivating virtue and decency.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But like the hedge itself,
                  these solutions are both partly separated from and integrated
                  into society - and they are consequently fraught with problems
                  and tensions.  The family is hardly insulated from the consumerism,
                  jealousies, and insecurities that course through the civilization
                  around it; and we don't really have the option of retreating
                  to a natural sanctuary in same way as the Hedge animals.  And
                  if Rousseau's vision of a political and legal system based on
                  the general will strikes you as more than a little vague, romantic,
                  and even dangerous, you aren't alone.  Rousseau has been frequently
                  criticized as anything ranging from an ungrounded idealist to
                  an apologist for totalitarianism. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Americans seem to have adopted
                  their own distinctive solutions to the problems identified by
                  Rousseau, based on inducing or creating virtue through contrivance
                  and structure.  Through the separation of powers, a complex representation
                  scheme, and a system of ambitious leaders countervailing one
                  another, we give rise to a political and legal system in which
                  even the most selfish must justify their actions in terms of
                  the common interest. And through the large scale or scope of
                  our nation we supplement these institutional checks with a diverse
                  and divided nation that is intended to only come to agreement
                  on measures consistent with, as The Federalist Papers put it,
                  &quot;justice and the general good.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Has it worked? Again, the narrative
                  of <i>Over the Hedge</i> gives us reason to pause.  While the
                  animals retreat back to their natural existence, largely unsullied
                  and undamaged, the humans are left behind, frayed, flummoxed,
                  and wounded by their own technology and anxieties.  The lingering
                  smiles and laughter of the animals - and of the children leaving
                  the movie - are not our own.<br>
