            <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I AM NOT REALLY A PRESIDENT,
<br>
            BUT I PLAY ONE ON TV</font></b></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by John Denvir</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I think all the discussions
            about whether Michael Moore's  arguments in <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i>
            are valid or not miss the point. Moore is not a lawyer; he's
            a filmmaker.  We would demand factual accuracy and logical consistency
            from a lawyer, but films deal in images, not logic, and attempt
            to affect our views at a deeper level of human experience.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/fahrenheit.jpg" width="180" height="111" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">If
            we try to reduce the Moore's film to a logical argument, it's
            less than wholly convincing. Do we really think that the primary
            reasons for the invasion of Afghanistan was the building of an
            oil pipeline or an opportunity to divert attention from the Saudi
            royal family's connections with 9/11?</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Yet I would claim the film
            is a complete success in its larger purpose of undermining Bush's
            credibility as a political leader. Moore accomplishes this through
            the magic of images, cleverly juxtaposing hundreds of pictures
            of Bush, the smug rich kid, with hundreds of other images of
            the everyday Americans (and Iraquis) who have paid  a terrible
            price for his both his arrogance and his ignorance. <br>
            	<br>
            The portion of the film on Saudi Arabia may not effectively tie
            the sheikdom to 9/11, but it does allow Moore to show through
            use of film clips that supposed &quot;regular guy&quot; George
            Bush is actually a rich boy who likes to &quot;pal&quot; around
            with members of the Saudi royal family.  It turns out that the
            present Saudi Ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar,
            is an old friend of the Bush clan, even to the point of having
             been given the nickname &quot;Bandar Bush&quot; by the family.
            Not many Reagan conservatives will feel comfortable with that
            image. <br>
            	<br>
            But Moore's most damning images are of Bush himself.  For instance,
            we often see him in costume: cowboy, weekend golfer, fisherman,
            hunter, and, of course, the famous Tom Cruise &quot;Top Gun&quot;
            outfit. But three images in particular are particularly effective.
             One, of course, is the now famous shot of the President in golf
            regalia who, after urging leaders of all nations to aid in the
            war against terrorism, turns to the camera he thinks is turned
            off and says &quot;Now watch this drive.&quot; A second is a
            scene where we see Bush informed by an aide that the second World
            Trade Center has been attacked.  He does nothing for seven minutes
            more presidential than watch as a group of first graders read
            a children's book.  One senses FDR had a different reaction to
            hearing of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  Finally we have
            a frontal shot of the President as he is made up before a televised
            speech.  He appears to be playing an eye contact game with the
            someone behind the camera. &quot;Goofy&quot; is the adjective
            that comes to mind.  </font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It's important to note that
            the innuendo here is not that Bush is an &quot;evil&quot; man,
            only a slightly silly one.  But when this image is played against
            those of the victims of his policies in the second half of the
            movie, a feeling akin to disgust sets in. First, we see the civilian
            casualties in Iraq as Iraqui mothers cry for vengeance against
            the American bombs that have destroyed their homes and killed
            their children.  Then we see the effect of the war on American
            soldiers who were injured there and now vow to fight to make
            sure Bush is not re-elected. But most affecting of all is a long
            sequence showing the grief of a working class Michigan mother
            who had encouraged her children to enlist in the military to
            serve their country and advance their careers. We now see her
            read from the last letter sent by her now dead son condemning
            the war that made him go to Iraq for no good reason.  The mother's
            raw grief and anger incarnates Moore's fundamental accusation.
             How could we have allowed this superficial man wreak such havoc
            with the lives of decent Americans? <br>
            	<br>
            Is <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i> fair? Not in the least. Does it add
            to the national debate?  You bet it does.  It gives new meaning
            to the phrase  &quot;the personal is political,&quot; meaning
            now that we should look beyond the Bush's abstract claim to &quot;fight
            terrorism&quot; to see how this product of privilege's policies
            have affected ordinary Americans.   <br>
