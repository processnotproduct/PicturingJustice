<br>
                  <i>Antigone, Trifles, A Jury of Her Peers </i>and<i> Presumed
                  Innocent</i>. What do these literary pieces; a Greek tragedy,
                  an early twentieth century play and short story, and a contemporary
                  film have in common? The common thread between them is that they
                  depict women who where compelled to murder, or defy the law.
                  As the title of my article suggests, one of the women did something
                  good. Antigone's act of defiance represents a good deed, a moral
                  act that moved critics to describe her as the &quot;heroine of
                  civil disobedience&quot;. An act of civil disobedience that eventually
                  produced legal and political reform. Minnie Wright represents
                  the bad in the title; she allegedly murdered her husband in <i>A
                  Jury of Her Peers</i>. The admitted murderess in the film <i>Presumed
                  Innocent</i> definitely represents the ugly in her carefully
                  planned murder of her husband's former lover.<br>
<br>
                  There are many legal issues in the texts and film. Natural (divine)
                  law and positive (man made law or law of the state/polis) law,
                  civil disobedience and male/female perspectives of the law are
                  central issues in a discussion of Antigone. Physical/psychological
                  abuse or domestic violence and an exclusively female jury's perspective
                  of murder are the central focus of <i>Trifles</i> and <i>A Jury
                  of Her Peers</i>. <i>Presumed Innocent</i> is, unfortunately,
                  about everything that is wrong with the legal system and questions
                  the relationship between law and justice. <br>
<br>
                  The law and life are inseparable. And that is precisely why there
                  are so many novels, plays and films based on legal issues or
                  with lawyers as central characters.<br>
<br>
                  <b>Antigone<br>
                  <i>The Story and Setting<br>
                  </i></b><br>
                  Modern psychologists and clinical sociologists use the phrase
                  &quot;dysfunctional family&quot; to describe a family unit which
                  suffers from serious problems such as alcohol or drug abuse or
                  incest. Antigone, the main character in this ancient Greek tragedy,
                  comes from such a family. Her father, Oedipus, once king of Thebes
                  and solver of the riddle of the sphinx (what walks on four legs
                  in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?
                  - man) As Mark Howenstein puts it, Oedipus &quot;<i>...</i>comes
                  to realize the underlying horror of his existence. Throughout
                  the play his insatiable hunger for knowledge propels him down
                  a dreadful path of self-discovery. His relentless inquiry into
                  the causes of King Laius' death reveals that he has unknowingly
                  killed his father and married his mother, and has incestuously
                  begotten four children by her. Overcome by disgrace, he gouges
                  out his eyes and goes into exile, attempting to escape the misery
                  that he alone has wrought.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After wandering for years in
                  exile with Antigone, Oedipus finally settles at Colonus, a sacred
                  grove, an appropriate place to die and find peace for his wretched
                  soul. Creon, Antigone's uncle, tries to lure Oedipus back to
                  Thebes to no avail. Oedipus dies, so no longer needing to care
                  for their father, Antigone and her sister Ismene return to Thebes.
                  Antigone's brothers, Polynices and Eteocles, fight for control
                  of the kingdom and slay one another in combat. Creon succeeds
                  to the throne. Eteocles died fighting for his country and is
                  thus entitled to a proper burial. Creon issued an edict which
                  forbade anyone to bury Polynices. His body is left exposed to
                  the elements, to rot and be eaten by beasts and birds because
                  he fought against his native city and is deemed a traitor. <br>
<br>
                  Antigone is left with a moral dilemma. Should she abide by her
                  familial obligation to her brother and the holiest laws of the
                  gods which require one to bury one's deceased kin? Or obey the
                  edict - man made law of king Creon? Haemon, Creon's son and Antigone's
                  fianc&eacute;, contests the law, but Antigone boldly and openly
                  defies it. She buries Polynices. Creon plans Antigone's punishment
                  and banishes her to a sealed cave to die a slow and agonizing
                  death. Later, Creon reverses himself, buries Polynices and orders
                  Antigone's release from the cave. But his change of heart came
                  too late. Antigone hangs herself in the cave, and when Haemon
                  finds her body he stabs himself. Creon's wife, Eurydice, commits
                  suicide upon learning of her son Haemon's death leaving only
                  Creon and Ismene to agonize over all the deaths in the family.<br>
<br>
                  <b>Multiple Legal and Philosophical Issues<br>
                  </b><br>
                  Legal thinkers, scholars and philosophers continue to analyze
                  Antigone and its numerous themes. In Costas Douzinas' philosophical
                  article on ontological and psychoanalytical ethics he maintains
                  that:</font><br>
                  &quot;<font size="-1" face="Verdana">Antigone is as important
                  for the exploration of the origins and the force of law as Oedipus
                  is for the foundation of identity. We are all aware of the jurisprudential
                  and speculative readings of Antigone. The tragedy concerns the
                  unfolding of a series of conceptual juxtapositions, embodied
                  and represented by the two diametrically opposed protagonists.
                  The key conflict may be that between divine and human law, or
                  between law and justice, family and state, or individual and
                  society; but its narrative presentation always follows the same
                  path. <br>
                  ...But it is Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus, who has guided
                  the steps of philosophy and psychoanalysis to the primal scene
                  from which jurisprudence emerges, and from which it never leaves.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A mainstay of the law and literature
                  curriculum, Sophocles' Antigone is among the purest examples
                  of natural law theory. It contains the moral absolutism that
                  underscores natural law theory and suggests dramatic contrasts
                  with legal positivism, the dominant force in modern western law.

                  <b>Trifles and A Jury of Her Peers<br>
                  </b><br>
                  True life events are often the source of plays, novels and movies.
                  Susan Glaspell based the play <i>Trifles</i>, which was a year
                  later transformed into the short story <i>A Jury of her Peers</i>,
                  on an actual case. Decades later in 1981, it was adapted by Sally
                  Heckel into an Academy Award nominated film. The actual case
                  was the 1901 trial of Margaret Hossack, in <i>State v. Hossack</i>,
                  89 N. W. 1077 (Iowa 1902). Hossack was convicted of murdering
                  her husband with an axe while he was sleeping in bed. There was
                  evidence introduced at the trial of Mr. Hossack's physical and
                  emotional abuse of his wife. Susan Glaspell became familiar with
                  the case as a reporter for a Des Moines newspaper. She was assigned
                  to cover the case shortly after the murder of John Hassock. She
                  had no experience or exposure to the law or the courtroom. The
                  investigative reporting of the murder would be her introduction
                  to the criminal justice system. There is no doubt that the Hossack
                  (1901) case inspired the play <i>Trifles</i> and <i>A Jury of
                  her Peers</i>. But it took Glaspell fifteen years to pen <i>Trifles</i>
                  (1916) and <i>A Jury of Her Peers</i> (1917).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The setting for all three works
                  - the play, short story and the film - is the same: a gloomy
                  farmhouse kitchen. John Wright, recently strangled, and his wife
                  Minnie, who claims innocence and is in prison for the crime,
                  are never seen. Five people travel to the Wright farmhouse to
                  investigate - the sheriff, Mr. Peters, the prosecuting attorney,
                  Mr. Henderson, Mr. Hale a neighboring farmer, Mrs. Peters, the
                  prosecuting attorney's wife who has come specifically to gather
                  clothing for the accused woman and Mrs. Hale, the farmers wife.
                  Throughout the short story you never hear the voice of Mrs. Wright.
                  You only hear her words through the account of the conversation
                  Mr. Hale has with Mrs. Wright when he comes to her house to speak
                  with her husband John. He came to the farmhouse to ask John if
                  he would like to have a telephone installed in his house. <br>
<br>
                  &quot;'Can I see John?' 'No,' says she kind of dull like. 'Ain't
                  he home? says I. Then she looked at me. 'Yes,&quot; says she,
                  he's home.' 'Then why can't I see him?' I asked her, out of patience
                  with her now, &quot;Cause he's dead,' says she, just as quiet
                  and dull, and fell to pleatin' her apron. 'Dead?' says I, like
                  you do when you can't take in what you've heard. .... 'Why, what
                  did he die of?' &quot;He died of a rope round his neck,' says
                  she; and just went on pleatin' at her apron. &quot;Who did this
                  Mrs. Wright?&quot; 'I don't know,' she says. You don't know?'
                  ..... 'Weren't you sleepin in the bed with him?' 'Yes,' says
                  she, but I was on the inside.' 'Somebody slipped a rope round
                  his neck and strangled him and you didn't wake up?' says Harry.
                  'I didn't wake up.' she said after him'.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  The different perspectives of the men and women are immediately
                  evident. The men carry the weight of authority, they are charged
                  with the investigation of the murder. Based upon the time of
                  the setting, 1916, the men would decide what is relevant under
                  the law and act as judge and jurors, responsible for deciding
                  the fate of Mrs. Wright. The women are marginalized, they can't
                  serve on juries, their abilities are perceived to be limited
                  to domestic duties of cooking, sewing and housekeeping. After
                  the men enter the house they take charge attempting to solve
                  the crime based upon the evidence at the scene. Although they
                  are searching for a motive for the killing, &quot;something to
                  show anger - or sudden feeling,&quot; they spend only a few minutes
                  in the kitchen, where Mrs. Wright has spent most of her life.
                  The things in the kitchen are irrelevant to the men, and they
                  laugh at their wives and Mrs. Wright for their concern over domestic
                  &quot;trifles&quot; and criticize her poor housekeeping. <br>
<br>
                  The women act as the true judge and jury. In the most significant
                  dialogue and scenes in the play and story, the women discover
                  the evidence, a clue that the men, if they discovered it could
                  point to the motive of the crime, the specific event that could
                  have triggered Mrs. Wright's violent reaction. They find the
                  most incriminating evidence, the dead body of a songbird - canary
                  in Mrs. Wright's sewing box, gingerly wrapped in a beautiful
                  piece of silk, as if in preparation for a sacred burial. The
                  bird's neck was broken, twisted, the life &quot;choked out of
                  him&quot;. The women deduce that Mr. Wright strangled Mrs. Wright's
                  bird, her only source of joy in that lonely house. It was that
                  final act of cruelty that made her commit her violent act of
                  revenge. <br>
<br>
                  <b>Presumed Innocent<br>
                  </b><br>
                  I chose to include a film, a different literary medium, to point
                  out the difference in contextual communication between written
                  word and film. Sometimes film is a better vehicle for expressing
                  images that relate to identity and power. Novels, whether intentionally
                  or unintentionally often shroud the story from the reader. When
                  a novel is eventually made into a movie you often hear people
                  comment that &quot;the book was better than the movie&quot;.
                  In the case of <i>Presumed Innocent</i>, arguably the movie was
                  better than the book. <br>
<br>
                  <b>The Story - In Brief<br>
                  </b><br>
                  Rusty Sabich chief deputy district attorney investigates the
                  rape and murder of female attorney, Carolyn Pohlemus, another
                  deputy. His boss, the D.A., is up for election, he loses, and
                  new D.A. Della Guardia takes office. After the election Sabich
                  is charged with the murder of Pohlemus based on evidence at the
                  scene of the crime. His fingerprints are found on a glass, a
                  semen sample taken from Pohlemus matches Sabich's blood type,
                  phone records indicate they communicated, and after a search
                  of his home they find traces of Pohlemus's blood and traces of
                  her carpet fiber. In the meantime the D.A.'s office is under
                  internal scrutiny. A bribery file (b-file) points to a D.A. that
                  took a $1,500 bribe which was paid to a judge, the judge who
                  just happens to preside over Sabich's trial.<br>
<br>
                  Sabich's attorney Stern is very good, but he has help from an
                  informant friend Lipranzer who hides the most damaging evidence,
                  the fingerprinted glass. They never find the murder weapon. Witnesses
                  lie on the stand. Stern trips up the pathologist. Pohlemus's
                  tubes were tied so she wouldn't have used a spermicide and somehow
                  they deduce then that the semen sample had to be from someone
                  other than Sabich. Stern threatens to disclose the judge's involvement
                  with the b-file. The judge dismisses the case, Sabich walks.
                  But that is not the end. <br>
<br>
                  One afternoon as Sabich is rummaging through his toolbox he finds
                  the murder weapon, a small hammer soaked with blood and blond
                  hair. Barbara, his wife, enters as he's cleaning off the murder
                  weapon. &quot;I did it&quot;, she says. The words have double
                  meaning; she's speaking of her job interview, he thinks she's
                  confessing. In the final scene of the movie she tells her husband
                  what she did and why. She claims she would have confessed in
                  time to save her husband's life. But would she really have done
                  so? And who would believe her? <br>
<br>
                  <b>Female Identity - Women and Power <br>
                  </b><br>
                  The image of the woman attorney in the film is not based upon
                  her legal prowess, but on her sexuality. In fact, the overall
                  message of the film suggests that it was her sexuality that caused
                  her murder: &quot;the lady was bad news.&quot; is the phrase
                  used repeatedly to describe her. Even though she is violently
                  murdered before the narrative begins she remains a sexualized
                  presence throughout the film through flashbacks and reminiscent
                  day dreams. One of the lines in the film summarizes the way the
                  male attorneys viewed Pohlemus. Note the order of each descriptive

                  word or phrase used to describe her. &quot;What a waste, (referring
                  to the murder) beautiful, sexy gal, hell of a lawyer.&quot; She
                  was a &quot;hell of a lawyer&quot; last, beautiful and sexy first.
                  The film portrays her as an ambitious and talented, yet promiscuous,
                  attorney who had a sexual relationship with almost every male
                  character in the movie.<br>
<br>
                  The women have control and power through their sexuality and
                  violence in <i>Presumed Innocent</i>. The legal system is portrayed
                  as a bumbling machine that is more concerned with hiding human
                  flaws and frailty than serving justice. As often is the case,
                  the real criminal remains free. The &quot;ugly&quot; referred
                  to in the title of the paper could apply to everyone, not just
                  the women, in this film.</font></p>

                  </font></b><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
                  Who are Antigone, Minnie Foster Wright, and Barbara Sabich and
                  why did they do what they did? One woman was compelled by natural
                  law and familial love to defy the law, the others were motivated
                  by anger or desperation to kill. Did they have purely female
                  reactions to their circumstances or did they behave simply as
                  human beings? What all three women have in common is that they
                  felt they had no other choice; each one could have ended her
                  story with the same words of Barbara Sabich:<br>
                  &quot;You understand what happened had to happen. It couldn't
                  have turned out any other way. A woman's depressed with herself,
                  her life&#133; She feels power, control, the sense that she's
                  guided by a force beyond herself&#133; And life begins again.&quot;<br>
