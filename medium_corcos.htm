<br>
                  by Christine Alice Corcos</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">NBC has launched a new weekly
                  series from Glenn Gordon Caron featuring Patricia Arquette as
                  Allison Dubois, an Arizona housewife and former law office intern,
                  who claims to communicate with the dead. In the pilot, Allison's
                  husband Joe (Jake Weber) an aerospace engineer and skeptic, tries
                  to help her come to terms with her odd abilities. She is unhappy
                  with the way her life is developing. Approaching the ancient
                  age of thirty, she feels too old to go to law school, the original
                  plan, even though she has secured an internship at the local
                  DA's office, where they seem to like her, and where apparently
                  she can continue to work after she begins her law school career.
<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/medium.jpg" width="101" height="151" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">After Allison tells Joe about
                  her latest visions, which come to her in a disturbing dream,
                  he faxes an account of them to the Texas Rangers and they respond,
                  saying they'd like to talk to her. Apparently, her vision is
                  pretty close to a recent incident, and the Rangers think she
                  &quot;knows something.&quot; <br>
<br>
                  The major creative problems with <i>Medium</i> are that is the
                  writing and plotting are trite, and creator Caron leaves absolutely
                  no mystery about whether Allison will actually finger the guilty
                  party. Of course she will; she knows whodunit. That's the trouble
                  with having a psychic as your detective. Indeed, in an interview
                  with People magazine, the real-life Joe says, &quot;When you're
                  married to a medium, you don't lie.&quot; Anyone who has seen
                  more than a few &quot;psychic detective&quot; or &quot;medium&quot;
                  movies or television shows know that the psychic, if s/he is
                  &quot;genuine&quot; is often disbelieved by the police, who think
                  she has inside information; thus s/he loses valuable time while
                  s/he establishes his or her bona fides. Real life psychic detectives
                  claim they undergo the same scrutiny. Real life police officers
                  claim they waste valuable time tracking down useless psychic
                  leads, just as the assistant DA (Balinda Alexander) complains
                  in the pilot episode's early scene.<br>
<br>
                  In order to make <i>Medium</i> palatable, and interesting, to
                  the audience, developer Caron (<i>Moonlighting</i>) has to give
                  the television Allison many more powers than any real life psychic
                  could ever deliver. For one thing the tv Allison has the ability
                  to dream or picture very clear images. Real life psychic mediums
                  (and not all psychics claim to be mediums) almost never claim
                  to do so. Instead they tend to assert that their visions are
                  figurative, partial, and must be interpreted. In the episode
                  &quot;Night of the Wolf&quot; (aired January 24, 2005) Allison
                  actually picks up and comforts a little boy who materializes
                  as a physical being, and whom her six year old daughter can see
                  though he has been dead for five years. Until now we have not
                  seen either television or films make the claim that materialization
                  or &quot;trance&quot; mediums could do such a thing. John Edward,
                  James van Praagh, Sylvia Browne, and Rosemary Altea certainly
                  don't. Yet here is the fictionalized Allison Dubois touching,
                  holding a six year old ghost as material as her own daughter.
                  Ectoplasm went out with the trance mediums of the fifties, but
                  for purposes of Allison's credibility with the D.A.'s office
                  we need to see truly supernatural abilities on Allison's part.
                  As another medium tells Allison in the pilot, we need to see
                  that Allison is a rare medium indeed.<br>
<br>
                  And credibility is the point. Prosecutor Manuel Devalos (Miguel
                  Sandoval) constantly bemoans the fact that he employs a psychic,
                  even as he exploits her talents. He hides her away in a broom
                  closet sized office, which she shares with a police sketch artist.
                  Devalos cautions her not to tell anyone precisely what kind of
                  consulting she does for him. That would spell doom, since he
                  would lose all bona fides with his staff, with the judges, with
                  the juries, with the press, with the public-it would certainly
                  be a disaster. Yet every episode thumps us over the head with
                  Allison's gifts, with her honesty, with her reliability, and
                  with her ability to come through in a crisis. Her visions are
                  dead on (sorry). Let's get some of those skeptical scientists
                  in from the local University to test her. In real life, the nearest
                  scientist available is Gary Schwartz, of the University of Arizona,
                  who has actually tested the real Allison DuBois and considers
                  her genuine. However, others who have examined the results of
                  his tests consider his protocols flawed, partly because of researcher
                  bias (see references, below).<br>
<br>
                  In my own research into the work of psychics and trance mediums,
                  and their interactions with the law, I have yet to come across
                  contemporary practitioners who claim to have visions of nearly
                  the quality that the tv Allison has, especially when she is awake.
                  She talks to dead people constantly. Her dead people are just
                  like the live people I see every day, maybe even more animated.
                  They have substance. Their messages are amazingly clear. If real
                  life mediums could deliver on such claims, they need never fear
                  fraud charges and we need never worry that our police departments
                  might hire them to solve cold cases. Indeed, we'd never have
                  cold cases at all. We'd never have mistaken verdicts. We'd never
                  have innocent people on death row. We might not need lawyers
                  or judges or courtrooms, or Innocence Projects. But, according
                  to the People magazine interview cited below, the Texas Rangers
                  refuse to &quot;confirm they even worked with DuBois.&quot; Not
                  exactly a ringing endorsement. Compare the insights TV Allison
                  has with the ones People magazine quotes. TV Allison works with
                  spirits who appear in specific places who point her toward actual
                  clues. But according to that People magazine piece, when she
                  worked with the Texas Rangers, she described the suspect and
                  accomplices and predicted the body would be found within 5 years;
                  it was found 4 years and 10 months later. Many bodies do eventually
                  turn up, given enough time. Psychics aren't the only people able
                  to predict such eventualities. <br>
<br>
                  The big legal roadblock Allison's employer has is finding an
                  independent source for some, if not all, of her clues. The need
                  for &quot;proof&quot;, that is, real life evidence, as opposed
                  to what we see through Allison's eyes, once again holds the legal
                  system, the defense bar, and sometimes the protections of the
                  Constitution, up to ridicule. In one episode, DA Devalos tells
                  Allison that he can't get a search warrant based on her certain
                  knowledge that a witness is describing the wrong suspect. Of
                  course he is correct, but he goes ahead, obtains the search warrant,
                  citing an anonymous and completely fictitious informant (probably
                  trading on his own credibility with the local neutral and detached
                  magistrate), and the case proceeds to trial. The defense attorney
                  attacks Allison on the stand, since she is the person who provided
                  the information justifying the warrant. The attorney asks her
                  who was her &quot;anonymous source&quot;, since she has only
                  been working in the DA's office a few months. How could she have
                  developed a trusting relationship with anyone to the extent that
                  that person would give her such information? In a low tone of
                  voice, Allison speaks a name from his past-the name of the person
                  he paid to take his bar exam for him. She blackmails him into
                  ceasing his line of questioning. Hooray! A victory for the saintly
                  prosecution and a defeat for the evil defense. The real killer
                  is eventually convicted, we assume. But the D.A. should never
                  have gotten his search warrant to begin with, and the defense
                  attorney was right to try to get the evidence suppressed. Is
                  this the message we really want to see promulgated? More bashing
                  of the Fourth Amendment? The heroine's blackmail of opposing
                  counsel? The prosecuting attorney's lies? Should psychics be
                  putting their gifts to use by any means possible for the ends
                  they identify? Are they the sole judges of what is best? <br>
<br>
                  This problem is only one of the legal and policy issues I see
                  imbedded within <i>Medium</i>. Another is the active promotion
                  of the notion that tax money might profitably be spent on the
                  use of psychic detectives and psychic consultants on crime solving.
                  Might viewers, watching this show, be led to believe that psychics
                  could actually help the police solve crimes by visiting crime
                  scenes and handling evidence? Some current psychics claim to
                  do so and those claims are the basis for at least some of the
                  activities presented on this program. But law enforcement officials
                  who allow non-law enforcement trained personnel to participate
                  as Allison does are putting both the cases and their jobs at
                  risk. The fact is that few, if any, police departments actually
                  admit to using psychics. Most officials that psychics simply
                  waste time predicting that bodies or missing persons will be
                  found near water, or trees, or buildings with red roofs. Experienced
                  detectives combing particular areas, can do as well, and will
                  not raise false hopes among the families and friends of the victims.

<br>
                  <i>Mediu</i>m is moderately well-acted, adequately written and
                  will be around in Fall, 2005 for a second season. Its success
                  indicates psychic phenomena and magical thinking continues to
                  fascinate the U. S. public. I continue to despair.<hr align="LEFT"><br>
