                  CLOSE TO HOME</i>, AND <i>LAW &amp; ORDER</i></font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Televised pop culture concentrates
                  on only one side of the criminal justice process. Prosecutors,
                  police, and police forensics rule the roost. Countless TV series
                  glorify those who toil for law enforcement. Defense lawyers have
                  virtually disappeared from the airwaves, except as weasels who
                  get trounced by the prosecutors. The traditional noble defender,
                  running from <i>Perry Mason</i> and <i>The Defenders</i> through
                  <i>Matlock</i> to <i>L. A. Law</i> and <i>The Practice</i>, seems
                  to be on life support. Alan Shore on <i>Boston Legal</i> occasionally
                  attempts a bit of criminal defense, but those cynical and obviously
                  parodied stories do little to enhance the image of the criminal
                  defense bar. The tenacious attorneys on <i>Injustice</i> challenge
                  the past convictions of innocent defendants. But that's about
                  it for the defense side.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">What's going on here? What
                  explains this swing of the pendulum in favor of crime-fighting?
                  Are viewers so terrified by crime that they're only interested
                  in police, forensic scientists, and prosecutors? Yet violent
                  crime rates are far below those of ten or twenty years ago. Do
                  most viewers detest criminal defense lawyers? Well, probably
                  so, but they've felt that way for years, so what's changed? Are
                  people terrified that guilty people are getting acquitted? Maybe,
                  but there's been far more recent publicity about innocent people
                  being convicted and later exonerated by DNA testing (a development
                  that <i>Injustice</i> shrewdly capitalizes on). In a time of
                  war, do viewers want to be assured that government knows what
                  it's doing? Yet the President's approval ratings are dismal and
                  people seem to distrust government more than ever. Is it blowback
                  from 9/11? Yet it's hard to see the connection between terrorist
                  atrocities and the normal routine of urban street crime.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Whatever the reason, the message
                  from pop culture is that the cops, police forensic scientists,
                  and prosecutors are noble and fascinating creatures who have
                  all the right answers, while those on the defense side are faintly
                  repugnant toads who, at best, merit protection under the Endangered
                  Species Act. This highly opinionated article focuses on two new
                  prosecutor dramas, <i>Conviction</i> and <i>Close to Home</i>,
                  comparing them to that mainstay of police/prosecutor sanctification,
                  <i>Law &amp; Order</i>.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In <i>Conviction</i>, Dick
                  Wolf creates a prosecution office as different from <i>Law &amp;
                  Order</i> as it could possibly be. We see an ensemble of impossibly
                  good looking and extremely horny 20- and 30-somethings on a crusade
                  against crime and sleeping alone. Like <i>The Practice</i> and
                  <i>LA Law</i> before it, <i>Conviction</i> is a workplace drama
                  in which the personal lives of the characters center on their
                  place of employment. Clearly, Wolf was stung by the sudden death
                  of his previous series <i>Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury</i>
                  (which I, for one, thought was excellent) as well as by a ratings
                  decline in the flagship <i>Law &amp; Order</i>. <i>Conviction</i>
                  attacks the prized 18-49 demographic with gusto. Of course, it
                  also helped in selling the series that the new show was able
                  to use the costly sets built for <i>Law &amp; Order: Trial by
                  Jury</i>.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/laworder.jpg" width="108" height="143" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Every
                  episode of <i>Law &amp; Order</i>, you'll recall, has an identical
                  structure. Each concerns only a single case. In the first half
                  hour, typical New Yorkers stumble on a dead body. Inspired police
                  investigation turns up the real killer. In the second half, prosecutor
                  Jack McCoy and his female associate convict them. The cops and
                  prosecutors have no life outside the office and do little socializing
                  even there (there are the occasional brief congratulatory bar
                  scenes at the end of the episode where McCoy gets to make an
                  ironic point about the proceedings). With rare exceptions, nothing
                  is said about the characters' personal lives (at the most, we
                  get a tantalizingly brief glimpse of their problems with family
                  or alcoholism). It's all work. Turnover in the cast makes little
                  difference to the show's appeal because it's all about the stories,
                  not the actors.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I'm a fan of <i>Law &amp; Order</i>.
                  The stories are well written, often very thought-provoking, sophisticated,
                  and complex. A recent show, for example, raised issues of great
                  importance about the use of private security contractors in fighting
                  the Iraq war and the lack of any system for holding private contractors
                  accountable. That episode featured a lefty defense lawyer, Danielle
                  Melnick, who has appeared repeatedly on <i>Law &amp; Order</i>
                  and clashed entertainingly with McCoy, but who seems to care
                  more about the cause than her client. The writers are lawyers
                  themselves and they strive to achieve legal accuracy.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">To me, the phenomenal commercial
                  success of <i>Law &amp; Order</i> is baffling: there's no sex
                  or violence and the show never dumbs itself down or underestimates
                  the viewers' intelligence. If you doze off or get up to answer
                  the phone or go to the bathroom, you're going to lose the thread
                  of the story. As a result, <i>Law &amp; Order</i> seems to flout
                  every conventional rule for success in the world of mass media,
                  yet old episodes play every day on cable while new episodes continue
                  to appear on NBC. Although I can't account for its success, I
                  appreciate the high quality of the show and I watch it religiously.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/closetohome.jpg" width="127" height="87" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Close
                  to Home</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is more like
                  the <i>Law &amp; Order</i> narrative model than that used in
                  <i>Conviction</i>. The show is set in Indianapolis, a big city
                  with plenty of crime but lacking the grit and glamour of Manhattan
                  or L. A. It focuses on a single dedicated prosecutor, the highly
                  attractive Annabeth Chase and her supervisor, a black woman named
                  Maureen Scofield. Like <i>Law &amp; Order</i>, each episode of
                  <i>Close to Home</i> concerns only a single case (often involving
                  some form of domestic violence), so the story can be developed
                  in some depth and there are interesting plot twists. Unlike the
                  celibates on <i>Law &amp; Order</i>, however, Chase has a personal
                  life. She's married, has a baby, and is just returning from maternity
                  leave. She also has a very supportive husband who is a full child-care
                  partner and is happy to step in to help when Chase has to rush
                  to the office in the middle of the night or on weekends.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A recent story involved an
                  interesting Miranda issue in which the suspect never quite told
                  the detective interrogating him that he wanted a lawyer but kept
                  asking whether he needed one. It also involved a canny defense
                  lawyer who successfully bluffs the prosecutors into accepting
                  a plea bargain in a winnable case. I like <i>Close to Home</i>,
                  but it's nowhere near as well written as <i>Law &amp; Order</i>.
                  My sense is that the scenes involving Chase's struggle to balance
                  home and work are thin and artificial, grafted onto the legal
                  story just to show that she's a human being and, perhaps, to
                  appeal to a female young-working-mother demographic.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/conviction.jpg" width="139" height="93" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Which
                  brings us to <i>Conviction</i>. Here each episode presents three
                  to five cases, intercutting between them throughout the hourly
                  show along with personal tidbits about the lawyers. The multi-story
                  format has some advantages and a big disadvantage. The major
                  advantage is that it allows most members of the ensemble to play
                  important roles in each episode. Another advantage is that the
                  format represents the reality of a prosecutor's office: everybody
                  is rushing around trying to cover the caseload. New cases pour
                  in, the pace is frantic, and mistakes get made. Lawyers have
                  to spend precious time trying to get witnesses to appear at trial
                  and not chicken out on the testimony they promised to give. (Jessica
                  Rossi gives a prostitute $50 for a heroin fix in order to get
                  her to court to testify against a rapist). Cases fizzle out because
                  witnesses are found to have lied to the police. Most of the others
                  get plea bargained. Only a few make it to trial. This approach
                  gives a genuine sense of the way an urban prosecutor's office
                  functions. The <i>Law &amp; Order</i> and <i>Close To Home</i>
                  model of devoting all of the office's resources to a single high
                  profile case is a stylized way of telling a story in depth, but
                  it's not realistic.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The disadvantage of the multi-story
                  format, however, is that none of the stories on <i>Conviction</i>
                  are well developed, because there just isn't time for it. You'll
                  forget them by the next morning. So if you're looking for sophisticated
                  and challenging legal and ethical stories (and I am), <i>Conviction</i>
                  will probably be rather disappointing, the cultural equivalent
                  of fast food.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But the show has some strong
                  points. I liked the emphasis in several stories on rookie Nick
                  Potter, who has just arrived at the office from a Wall St. firm
                  because he wants to try cases (young people in big firms never
                  try cases or even meet with clients and even senior litigation
                  partners almost never get to trial). Yet Nick doesn't have a
                  clue what he's supposed to be doing and is the subject of good
                  natured hazing by his colleagues. Nick also finds himself in
                  a dilemma when he witnesses police brutality while on a ride-along
                  with the cops. In the subsequent Internal Affairs investigation,
                  he must decide whether to tell the whole truth (and get the cops
                  fired) or pull his punches (so he can continue working with them
                  for the rest of his career).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Christina Finn is terrified
                  when she tries her first case, especially when the judge makes
                  and then sustains objections to her leading questions. (She's
                  also cruelly hazed by the judge for leaving the evidence-cocaine-on
                  her desk during the lunch break). Busy prosecutorial offices
                  always have rookies who must be trained and brought along slowly
                  and acculturated into the office's institutional life. And when
                  a prosecutor with an organized crime case is gunned down in the
                  pilot episode (his dinner location perhaps disclosed by Nick's
                  incautious comment), I thought that made for effective drama
                  about the physical dangers of a prosecutor's life.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Also I don't mind experiencing
                  the personal lives of the characters when it illuminates their
                  work experience. Brian Peluso (who probably gets more face-time
                  than any other member of the ensemble) is a compulsive gambler
                  who owes money to his bookie. This entangles him in a serious
                  conflict of interest when his bookie pressures him to get Christina
                  to go easy on a gun case involving the bookie's relative. If
                  I'm to invite these characters into my living room for the long
                  haul, I'd like to get to know them as people. Thus I always enjoyed
                  the mixture of gritty criminal defense and unhappy personal lives
                  on <i>The Practice</i>, especially the way the writers managed
                  so often to link the two.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Another thing I liked about
                  the four <i>Conviction</i> episodes I've seen is that the bureau
                  chief, Alexandra Cabot, is politically ambitious and imposes
                  hard-line policies on the office in order to project an image
                  of being tough-on-crime. Serious juvenile criminals must be prosecuted
                  as adults. No pleading down drug cases or gun crimes. The results
                  of such policies can be very harsh. An apparently intelligent
                  and reasonably decent 14-year old boy kills his bullying big
                  brother with a baseball bat. Office policy prevents the prosecutors
                  from treating this tragic case as a juvenile matter. The kid
                  must be tried as an adult. The prosecutors offer manslaughter
                  and 8 years, but the kid's father (having lost one son and threatened
                  now by losing another) won't let him accept the deal, assuring
                  him that he'll surely be acquitted of second degree murder. The
                  predictably tragic result ensues. But the office's policy of
                  insisting on prosecuting children who commit violent crimes as
                  adults is even more at fault for this unjust result than the
                  overbearing father. In this era of excessive criminal penalties
                  (such as three-strike laws and mandatory minimum sentences for
                  minor drug offenses) and ever-increasing prison populations,
                  I appreciate the show's effort to critique excessively harsh
                  prosecution and punishment policies.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">And now for a few words on
                  the subject of sex. I personally like emphasis on the sexuality
                  of the characters in film or television drama when it is set
                  within an interesting and developing personal relationship and
                  is well integrated into the story. Take, for example, <i>Six
                  Feet Under</i>. That great show bristled with interesting sexual
                  relationships: Nate and Brenda. David and Keith. Ruth and George.
                  Claire and Billy. Federico and Vanessa. And many more. But on
                  <i>Six Feet Under</i> the sex was always part of a much bigger
                  personal story. I don't mind graphic language (indeed, I like
                  it when characters on HBO say fuck and shit, as real people do
                  all the time). I don't object to the occasional sight of normally
                  concealed body parts or seeing simulated intercourse when the
                  sex involves relationships between characters I've come to empathize
                  with.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">However, the sex in <i>Conviction</i>
                  is different, somehow, and I've struggled to understand my reaction
                  to it. In <i>Conviction</i>, we see all of the prosecutors on
                  a roll-in the hay. Fundamentally, the show is a workplace drama
                  about a bunch of good-looking single people trying to get laid.
                  Several succeed in each episode, particularly Brian and Jessica.
                  Christina isn't very good at it and discovers potential partners
                  are happily married or prefer women with bigger boobs.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In this show, casual sex is
                  used to titillate viewers and appeal to the 18-49 demographic,
                  but it has little to do with the legal stories in the DA's office.
                  Wolf is obviously trying to capture a soap opera or <i>Desperate
                  Housewives</i> sensibility. As a definite non-member of the 18-49
                  demographic, I find the sexual banter and bedroom scenes in <i>Conviction</i>
                  boring and irrelevant. Not shocking (especially not in the laundered
                  form permitted on network TV), just tedious. I'm interested in
                  an intriguing legal story, and the sex just gets in the way.
                  But then that's my taste, not yours. Probably I'm just too last
                  century.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I can sympathize with Dick
                  Wolf's pursuit of the younger demographic and his attempt to
                  maintain his brand, but for provocative stories about law, lawyers
                  and ethics from a prosecutor's point of view, I'd stick with
                  <i>Law &amp; Order</i> with a fallback to <i>Close to Home</i>.
                  Leave the sex to the soap operas. Meanwhile, how about bringing
                  back to the small screen some dedicated criminal defense lawyers
                  like those lovable bottom feeders on <i>The Practice</i>? <br>
