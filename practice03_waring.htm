                  by Rob Waring</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the episode that aired on
                  October 5, 2003, <i>The Practice</i> got weirder. (Please see
                  Paul Bergman's excellent <a href="practice03_bergman.htm">recap
                  of cast changes</a> for the new season and the first episode.)
                  Eleanor defends a man accused of poisoning his wife, but the
                  case against him grows stronger when another suspect (his sister-in-law)
                  holds up well on cross-examination. Against the advice of his
                  lawyers, he insists on taking the stand in his own defense because
                  he thinks he has an honest face. Predictably, it gets worse for
                  him when he is confronted with a marital argument a neighbor
                  overheard that contradicts a key part of his testimony. His ten-year-old
                  daughter, who inexplicably and inappropriately is brought to
                  the courtroom each day to hear the sordid tales of her parents'
                  affairs and arguments, then blurts out that she knows something.
                  Eleanor pulls a confession out of her that she poisoned her mother.
                  On the strength of this, the rather gullible DA opts to dismiss
                  the charges against the father, having  been told that he'll
                  have to take defense counsel's word because the girl's new lawyer
                  will not allow her to incriminate herself again.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/practice03-2.jpg" width="171" height="115" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In
                  a subsequent twist, the father confesses to his lawyers that
                  he duped them by putting his daughter up to a false confession.
                  Since double jeopardy applies, he believes he has now gotten
                  away with murder. As they set their jaws in frustration at having
                  been &quot;played,&quot; he earnestly (with that honest face)
                  implores them to work with him to free his innocent daughter.
                  After he leaves, an embittered Eleanor vows that they will &quot;take
                  him down.&quot; That should be a real WWF smack-down event. So,
                  we have yet another edition of the noble defense lawyer who wants
                  to play judge and jury. Memo to viewers: when a lawyer has a
                  lying client who is manipulating her, she should get off the
                  case as the earliest opportunity. Resign. Vengeance is what defense
                  attorneys fight against. If it gets a hold of your emotions,
                  it's time to consider becoming a prosecutor.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Considering how sophisticated
                  he appears, it is hard to believe the father has not considered
                  another problem. Pushed by the girl's aunt, Child Protective
                  Services will almost certainly seek to have him declared an unfit
                  father if he testifies that the girl was lying. Convincing a
                  child to falsely confess to a murder only adds to the presumption
                  that a parent who kills is not a fit parent. In a dependency
                  hearing, unlike in criminal court, that he killed wife need not
                  be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. But, maybe he is a total
                  sociopath and doesn't really care about custody of his daughter.
                  Stay tuned.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The second story line is likely
                  to create more fuel for future episodes. In a delicious reprise
                  of his role as a sadistic lawyer in the film <i>Secretary</i>,
                  new cast member Alan (played by James Spader) takes on the claim
                  of Sheila (played by Sharon Stone), a friend and brilliant litigator
                  who has never lost a case. It seems she has been fired from her
                  law firm because she hears and obeys the voice of God. She also
                  thinks bald men can read her thoughts. So naturally, Alan claims
                  she has a disability and that her firing violated laws protecting
                  the disabled. Adam Arkin, making a guest appearance as defense
                  counsel, asserts that the claim is frivolous because the disability
                  laws do not protect people who are insane. (The Americans with
                  Disabilities Act has been held to protect workers with moderate
                  forms of mental illness.)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Alan tries to obtain a settlement
                  by pointing out that the senior partner in the firm had sex with
                  the plaintiff, and that if their defense is insanity she lacked
                  the ability to give consent. That would make the partner guilty
                  of rape under the law. Arkin protests that a threat of a criminal
                  prosecution in order to force a settlement is blackmail and a
                  violation of a lawyer's ethical duties that is grounds for disbarment.
                  Later, Eugene, who seems to have assumed the role of senior partner
                  on the show now that Bobby is gone, also chastises Alan for this
                  tactic.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Although I recall Alan referring
                  to the criminal violation as being strong enough to interest
                  the DA, he did not actually condition bringing the charge upon
                  failure to settle the ADA claim. He was pushing the envelope,
                  and should have chosen his words more carefully. It was legitimate
                  for him to point out that his trial strategy for refuting Arkin's
                  assertion that Sheila was insane would be to raise the sexual
                  relations as proof that the senior partner apparently did not
                  regard her as insane. (Or else that would make him a rapist subject
                  to prosecution.) In any event, as a plot device it provides further
                  evidence that Alan is unethical and that he and Eugene are likely
                  to have more confrontations over his tactics.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Flash forward to the trial,
                  with Sheila making her opening statement. Apparently getting
                  messages from God, she is able to point out personal details
                  in the lives of several jurors. This explains her unbroken string
                  of trial victories. In this case, however, she is a bit too open
                  about her secret weapon, and her unnerving approach results in
                  a mistrial. (Proving once again, that an attorney who represents
                  herself has a fool for a client.) Sheila, who cannot stand to
                  be alone with her thoughts (apparently God is a bit of a chatterbox)
                  begs Alan to give her a job and a case to work on. His loyalty
                  to her (heavily sprinkled with flirtation) proves strong, and
                  he agrees to find a way for her to work for his new firm, even
                  though he has not consulted Eugene. So now there is a a supernatural
                  character and plot element, just in time for Halloween.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The obvious place for Sheila
                  is as a jury consultant. Her source of inside information would
                  make her a much sought after trial weapon. This closely tracks
                  one of the plot elements in <i>The Devil's Advocate</i>, where
                  Keanu Reeves, apparently in communication with the devil, has
                  an uncanny ability to pick juries and has never lost a case.
                  (He does provide an earthly explanation as to how he was &quot;privy&quot;
                  to the minds of jurors, but the suspicion remains that he has
                  some help from Dad.) It will be interesting to see if <i>The
                  Practice</i> pursues this vector. (If the show does go in this
                  direction, it won't be with this character. Sharon Stone is only
                  scheduled for a guest appearance for a few episodes.) A lawyer
                  with an unlimited source of inside information could raise holy
                  hell in the courtroom.<br>
