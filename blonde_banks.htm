                  by Taunya Lovell Banks, University of Maryland School of Law</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Legally Blonde</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">, a summer comedy, raises the not-so-novel
                  question, &quot;do blonde women have problems being taken seriously?&quot;.
                  Although this tongue-in-cheek comedy takes deliciously hilarious
                  jabs at sorority life, Southern California, and law school culture,
                  especially Harvard Law School, it contains a serious message
                  about life and law school. There are many roads to success, even
                  in law school.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/legally blonde 7.jpg" width="203" height="152" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Elle
                  Woods (Reese Witherspoon), the blonde protagonist in <i>Legally
                  Blonde</i>, is a fashion merchandizing major at UCLA with a 4.0
                  grade point average. On the surface she seems to reflect LA cultural
                  stereotypes - trendy materialism and hedonism. It is no accident
                  that she shares her name with a fashion magazine and a fashion
                  model, Elle Macpherson. Elle's family even lives across the street
                  from television producer Aaron Spelling of <i>Beverly Hills 90210</i>
                  fame.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At the beginning of the film
                  Elle's only focus seem to be on getting married to her long-time
                  WASPy boyfriend Warner (Mathew Davis II). Instead of the much-anticipated
                  marriage proposal, Warner dumps Elle. In Warner's words, Elle
                  is not &quot;marriage material&quot; for a future U.S. Senator.
                  She is a &quot;Marilyn,&quot; not a &quot;Jackie.&quot; Determined
                  to win Warner back, Elle decides to follow him to Harvard Law
                  School. By this time, viewers already know that despite the California
                  bubble gum music, and Elle's over-the-top love of the color pink,
                  she is not your stereotypical blonde.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">When Elle announces her intent
                  to attend law school, her friends and family are surprised. They
                  describe law students as boring, ugly and serious - not characteristics
                  they value. Elle studies hard and earns a 179 (out of a possible
                  180) on the Law School Admissions Test. The male, all-white Harvard
                  Law School Admissions Committee, although troubled by her fashion
                  merchandizing major, admits Elle using a &quot;diversity&quot;
                  rationale - not enough bubbly, buxom blondes in the class! Ironically,
                  Warner, initially wait-listed, gets admitted after his father
                  calls the school - wealth-based affirmative action?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">From the very beginning Elle
                  seems out of place at Harvard. She comes to her first law school
                  class armed only with a pink heart-shaped note pad and matching
                  pink pen. Even when she decides to take law school seriously,
                  she still seems out of step.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Elle clearly marches to the
                  beat of a different drummer, as evidenced by a scene where her
                  pink-colored Apple computer sticks out among a sea of black PCs.
                  She hands out her resume on pink scented paper and comes into
                  the court in full pink ensemble. Perhaps, the intent again is
                  to reinforce the message that looks can be deceiving. You should
                  not judge a book by its color?</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Legally Blonde</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> also causes us to question some stereotypes
                  by sometimes reinforcing stereotypes about law school and lawyers.
                  Professor Stromwell (Holland Taylor), her only female professor,
                  seems like a female version of <i>One L</i>'s infamous Professor
                  Kingsfield. Professor Callahagan (Victor Garber), also a partner
                  in a prestigious law firm, holds the keys to a prestigious clerkship;
                  he also is a sexual harasser. No one, including her fellow students,
                  takes Elle seriously. She even is denied entry into a study group.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Nevertheless, Elle finds power
                  in her blonde beauty, using it as an asset as opposed to a liability.
                  She uses this power to help Dorky David (Oz Perkins), an overweight
                  nerdy law student, get a date; and again to disarm the lawyers
                  in the court who assumed it would be an easy win with her as
                  opposing counsel. Ultimately, Elle succeeds in court because
                  of her knowledge about fashion and hair, not necessarily because
                  of her legal acumen. She happens to be the right &quot;lawyer&quot;
                  at the right time. Perhaps, this is the true beauty of diversity--
                  a stereotypical law student might be much too bookish to have
                  time for a perm.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There also is a feminist undertone
                  to the movie. Elle's sorority sisters, although questioning her
                  decision to attend law school, are supportive. She in turn supports
                  and keeps secret the confidences of another sorority sister,
                  a defendant in a murder trial. There also is a broader camaraderie
                  among women in the film - especially working women (from the
                  nail tech to Professor Stromwell). They help each other and seem
                  to know that no matter what you look like, some men treat all
                  women the same -- badly.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Yet <i>Legally Blonde</i> is
                  not an anti-male film. There are positive male figures. Emmett
                  Richmond (Luke Wilson), the promising associate, gives up a partner-track
                  job to maintain his own integrity and support Elle. Dorky David
                  aids Elle in court. Even the UPS man comes across as supportive.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Legally Blonde</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> conveys a serious and somewhat subversive
                  message: you can rise above everyone's expectations or imposed
                  limitations (even and especially your own) to become something
                  more - even if your initial reasons for going in that direction
                  are not the reasons that cause you to continue to go in that
                  direction. This message is not limited to blonde women, but applies
                  to anyone who tends to be judged by stereotypical assumptions.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Legally Blonde</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> suggests that you do not have to be
                  mean-spirited, unattractive, or want your enemies to fail to
                  be successful. For Elle, success on her own terms is the best
                  revenge. This is a refreshingly different take on law school
                  and life.<br>
