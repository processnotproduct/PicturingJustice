<br>
                  <i>I Am Sam</i> (New Line Productions, 2001, Director Jessie
                  Nelson [hereinafter, <i>I Am Sam</i>]) is a touching movie of
                  the struggle of a disabled man to retain custody of his little
                  girl. It is a movie that pitted Sam against a seemingly unrelenting
                  rigid legal system, where the unfairness of processes at times
                  overwhelmed the viewer. However, the portrayed injustices are
                  not only unfair to Sam and his daughter Lucy, but also to the
                  viewer as a great misrepresentation of the legal system. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/iamsam3.jpg" width="112" height="167" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Moreover, the unfairnesses in
                  <i>I Am Sam</i> are in some ways similar to those portrayed in
                  <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i> (Columbia 1979 [hereinafter <i>Kramer
                  vs. Kramer</i>]). For instance, in <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i>,
                  the unfairness stemmed from the portrayal of how the court perceived
                  competence, that is, based on gender. The court in <i>I Am Sam</i>
                  seemed to base competence on usual cognitive development. <i>I
                  Am Sam</i> is a new version of an old theme, that being what
                  a court perceives as competence.<br>
<br>
                  Throughout the film the viewer is invited to take Sam's perspective.
                  This is also similar to what happened in <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i>.
                  Papke writes, &quot;[w]e are invited to accept his perspective.
                  We gaze on what happens in the lawyer's office and in the courtroom
                  from a masculine perch&quot; (D.R. Papke, <i>&quot;Peace Between
                  the Sexes: Law and Gender in Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;</i> (1996)
                  30 University of San Francisco Law Review at 1201 [hereinafter,
                  Papke]). In <i>I Am Sam</i>, the viewer is asked to take the
                  perspective of a disabled man. <br>
<br>
                  Sam needed a credible witness, being one with higher education
                  and a status job, to help prove parental competence to the court.
                  Sam's friends were thus ineligible. They could not provide useful
                  evidence as to Sam's parenting because they themselves were disabled,
                  and thereby unable to make themselves understood to the satisfaction
                  of the court. Sadly, they were depicted as useless and pitiful.
<br>
<br>
                  It was not the intention of Rita, Sam's lawyer to make Sam's
                  friends appear ridiculous. However, she made no attempt to try
                  to introduce their evidence in a way where they could meaningfully
                  express themselves. The cross-examination of these persons, thankfully,
                  not true to life, was degrading to both the people and the legal
                  system.<br>
<br>
                  Sam's lawyer found one witness, a doctor, who provided some evidence
                  about being parented by a disabled mother. However, the evidence
                  was quickly called into question, as there was doubt as to who
                  actually raised the doctor. The judge did not do much to control
                  the Prosecutor's vocal outbursts toward this witness, a clear
                  misrepresentation. Prosecutors and other lawyers are not at liberty
                  to yell at or badger witnesses. They must act respectfully or
                  risk the possibility of being in contempt of court or simply
                  irritating the judge and precipitating professional discipline.
                  &quot;Loose cannons&quot; are not encouraged nor permitted. Furthermore,
                  this doctor did not know Sam or Lucy and so could not speak to
                  their situation, making this evidence of little weight. <br>
<br>
                  The piano teacher, Ann, a last minute witness, was also made
                  out to be an incompetent witness due to her own disabilities
                  (a phobia of some sort and trauma due to her past experiences
                  with her father). Certainly, this line of questioning would not
                  be permitted in court. There is no reason why past experiences
                  with her father would have any bearing on Ann's testimony. It
                  was irrelevant, as was Ann's disability. Her perceptions as a
                  disabled person have nothing to do with her perceptions as a
                  person. She was clear in her speaking and reasoning. <br>
<br>
                  The State, however, had no difficulty in finding competent witnesses.
                  It was rather easy to find an expert witness, a psychologist,
                  willing to attest to Sam's alleged harm to Lucy's development.
                  Also, since the first complaint was from Lucy's school, there
                  were competent prosecution witnesses available, such as the teachers
                  and principal. It is also possible that the State could have
                  called the police officers who had previously arrested Sam. Sam
                  had not understood that he was being solicited by a prostitute
                  and was arrested. He was later released when it was determined
                  that he did not have the capacity to understand the situation.
                  The State thus easily found witnesses that fit the highly educated
                  and well-employed criteria. <br>
<br>
                  Additionally, there was no real effort to evaluate Lucy's usual
                  home environment and so provided biased evidence from the social
                  worker. This was another false impression given to the court
                  and the viewer. There were no ongoing visits to determine what
                  Lucy's life was like. In reality, the competence of a parent
                  is not based on a single visit.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
                  Sam himself could not give good evidence to support his claim
                  of why Lucy should stay with him. There was no adjustment by
                  the court to understand him or to facilitate the process. Sam
                  could not answer complex questions, and no real effort was made
                  to cross-examine him so that he could have explained his view
                  effectively. The judge allowed badgering, complex questioning,
                  which would not be permitted in reality. In effect, the odds
                  were stacked against Sam from the beginning. This is similar
                  to <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i>, as there, the odds were stacked
                  against the Father when &quot;the producers employ a resurrected
                  and misrepresented maternal preference standard&quot; (Papke,
                  supra at 1205). The standard of competence for Sam was a misrepresented
                  notion of regular mental cognitive ability.<br>
<br>
                  Throughout the movie, Sam was measured as a success or failure
                  in his parenting, work, and social skills. These competencies
                  seemed to be on trial in the court scenes. The burden was on
                  Sam to prove his fitness as a parent. Throughout these scenes,
                  it was obvious that he had a much more difficult time meeting
                  his burden of proof as compared to the burden on the State. The
                  State had no difficulty in showing that Sam had problems functioning
                  in society. However, from these struggles, it was not a far step
                  to infer that Sam was not a competent parent. The State through
                  the strength of their witnesses facilitated the discharge of
                  their burden, which in turn augmented the burden on Sam. The
                  viewer is asked to believe that the court would not even consider
                  the possibility that a disabled man could be a competent parent.<br>
<br>
                  In one telling courtroom scene Sam is being asked by the Prosecutor
                  to explain why he is a good parent for Lucy. Sam is posed complex
                  questions again and again in an aggressive manner. He finally
                  begins to speak about what it means to be a parent by quoting
                  from the movie <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i>. It contains an exceptional
                  speech about being a father that Sam recites. However, Sam does
                  not know when to stop or alter his testimony to make it sound
                  like his own. He quotes everything including the name of the
                  child in <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i>. The court and his lawyer are
                  appalled. <br>
<br>
                  It is a harsh criticism of the legal system that Sam was pushed
                  to provide answers conforming to court expectations. Sam did
                  all that was in his power to answer, finally resorting to saying
                  what the lawyer wanted to hear. It is a criticism of inflexibility
                  in asking questions demanding of conforming answers. The court
                  would likely not have been concerned if Sam had quoted from a
                  famous person, for example, Martin Luther King Jr., and said,
                  &quot;I have a dream&quot;. Thus, the scene was also a commentary
                  on the inappropriateness of people using pop culture to support
                  their positions. It was a critique of pop culture within pop
                  culture.<br>
<br>
                  Also, in the Kramer film, &quot;the lawyers are sarcastic, unrelenting,
                  and intimidating&quot; (Papke, supra at 1206). The judge &quot;presides
                  over the hearing and fails miserably to restrain misrepresentations
                  of the Kramers' lives&quot; (Papke, supra at 1206). The same
                  can be said of the lawyers and judge in <i>I Am Sam</i>. The
                  lawyers place everyone under a microscope, emotionally destroying
                  the witnesses on the stand. These scenes denounce the tendency
                  of the legal system to &quot;revictimize&quot; witnesses. Although
                  there are numerous safeguards to minimize witness' trauma, it
                  is a common theme in pop culture, not simply these two movies,
                  that these kinder practices are ignored. For example, in movies
                  such as <i>Cape Fear</i> (Universal/Amblin/Cappa/Tribeca, 1991,
                  directed by Martin Scorsese), rape-shield laws are ignored.<br>
<br>
                  This movie portrays lawyers as machines that shred people, and
                  not as those who question testimony. Picking apart people on
                  the stand, effectively crushing them and making them unable to
                  speak, is not reality. There is no semblance of an actual cross-examination
                  where lawyers do ask probing questions, but do not set out to
                  inflict trauma, which will require years of therapy to recover
                  from. It would be of no benefit to a client to engage such a
                  lawyer. The most detrimental effect of these vicious examination
                  scenes is that they appear to promote viewers' belief in them.<br>
<br>
                  The Papke (Papke, supra at 1206) article argues that the Kramer
                  film and <i>I Am Sam</i> are both highly unrealistic in a number
                  of ways. In an actual court setting, there would be allowances
                  for Sam's evidence to be admitted to court and given proper weight.
                  S. 15 of the Charter states that &quot;[e]very individual is
                  equal before and under the law and has the right to equal protection
                  and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular,
                  without discrimination based on &#133;mental or physical disability&quot;
                  (Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution
                  Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982,
                  c. 15). Exactly how that would be accomplished is unknown. However,
                  the court would have to take a creative approach in evaluating
                  and gathering evidence and in eliminating bias. Mental disability
                  is a ground of discrimination that the court is directed to take
                  notice of and reduce. It is impossible to eliminate all discrimination
                  in law, as law always discriminates against someone, but it is
                  possible to minimize it. <br>
<br>
                  Lucy's persistence in seeing her father was a major contribution
                  to Sam's continued contact with his daughter. Papke writes that
                  in <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i>, when the two parents &quot;decide
                  what to do about their son &#133;, and make peace between themselves,
                  they do so despite the law, and in part to spite the law&quot;(Papke,
                  supra at 1207). <i>I am Sam</i> does the same, suggesting that
                  there would have been a different outcome had Sam not lived so
                  close, or her foster parents not been so cooperative and compassionate.
                  The film implied that only due to these extraordinary efforts
                  could Sam and the foster family work as a unit to raise the child.
                  The outcome requires the viewer to consider that the court system
                  could never have come up with such a mutually acceptable solution.
<br>
<br>
                  In Alberta, &quot;[t]he goal of foster care is to return the
                  child to his or her own family as soon as possible&quot; (&quot;About
                  Foster Care&quot; online: <a href="http://www.child.gov.ab.ca/whatwedo/fostercare/page.cfm?pg=index">Alberta
                  Children's Services</a> (date accessed: 9 March 2003)). As well,
                  it &quot;describes the unique situation of providing temporary
                  family-based care to a child who cannot remain in their own home
                  due to child protection concerns or exceptional special needs&quot;
                  (Ibid). The courts and legal system seek, where possible, to
                  maintain family ties.<br>
<br>
                  <i>I Am Sam</i> is a heartwarming film, where love triumphs over
                  tyranny. However, the film does a disservice to the viewing public
                  in propagating myths about the legal system. The viewer is asked
                  to adopt the point of view of a disabled man, combating a legal
                  system where competence is equated with normal mental development.
                  However, as Papke comments that <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i> &quot;proposes
                  a modern variety of gender peace&quot; (Papke, supra at 1208),
