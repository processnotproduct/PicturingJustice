<br>
                  The legal thriller <i>High Crimes</i> stars Ashley Judd and Morgan
                  Freeman. The film combines a civilian lawyer with a military
                  court martial. Ashley Judd plays Claire Kubik, a successful criminal
                  defense lawyer with a large San Francisco firm. San Francisco
                  is always a great choice as a film location because the background
                  scenes are always wonderful. Kubik leads an almost idyllic life.
                  She is about to make partner, she lives in a great house and
                  has a terrific relationship with her apparently nice and good-looking
                  husband Tom. In a movie, whenever a string of happy scenes are
                  shown in a row, you know a tragedy is about to befall someone.
<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/highcrime.jpg" width="118" height="161" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Tragedy befalls Claire when the
                  FBI arrests Tom. He is charged with the murder of a number of
                  civilians in Central America some years ago while he was in the
                  Marine Corps. Naturally Ashley Judd wants to defend him herself
                  after he swears he is innocent and the victim of a cover-up.
                  The Marines assign a young looking lieutenant as defense counsel,
                  so Judd looks for someone else to assist her who has more experience
                  with court-martials. A down and out lawyer named Grimes, (Morgan
                  Freeman) who was thrown out of JAG and is a reformed drunk, was
                  recommended to her. Grimes seems to know all the angles in court-martials
                  on the base, and Freeman is terrific in the part, as he usually
                  is. Ashley Judd is also good in what is becoming her usual role
                  in thrillers.<br>
<br>
                  The plot moves briskly along, in the court room and out, with
                  plenty of twists and turns. There is ample evidence on both sides
                  of the question to keep us guessing as to whether Tom is really
                  guilty or the subject of a cover-up directed from above. I won't
                  give them away, or the ending. Although, it did strike me that
                  someone making the film had a list of formula elements for a
                  legal thriller and was checking them off to make sure they were
                  all in there somewhere. The film also suffers from the Hollywood
                  vision of the military and court-martials. The Marines are presented
                  as mostly aggressive, head shaved and none too bright. It is
                  assumed the court martial is basically unfair and can be easily
                  manipulated by those in positions of power. They even work in
                  the old clich&eacute; &quot;military justice is to justice as
                  military music is to music.&quot; I had quite a bit of experience
                  doing court martials in the Army and I found them to be very
                  fair on guilt or innocence and the admission of evidence, if
                  a little tough when it came to sentencing.<br>
<br>
                  The film is well acted by the lead characters; especially Freeman,
                  he and Judd have good chemistry together. The twist ending is
                  a bit predictable. You have to allow for some artistic license
                  on some of the legal points as well as the anti-military bias,
                  but on the whole, the movie is good fun and I would recommend
                  it.</font></p>
