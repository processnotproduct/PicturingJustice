                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sigmund Freud was one of the
                  most influential and controversial psychologists of the 20th
                  century, and indeed has been referred to as the Father of Psychoanalysis.
                  His theories center upon the idea that &quot;human behavior is
                  primarily instinctive and motivated mainly by unconscious mechanisms&quot;
                  (B.R. Hergenhahn, An Introduction To Theories Of Personality,
                  2nd ed. (New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1984) at 14 [hereinafter,
                  Hergenhahn]). <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/cape fear 3.jpg" width="180" height="125" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In the 1991 film
                  <i>Cape Fear</i> (Universal/Amblin/Cappa/Tribeca 1991, directed
                  by Martin Scorsese, [hereinafter, <i>Cape Fear</i>]), Max Cady
                  seduces his former lawyer, Sam Bowden's, daughter. Fourteen years
                  previous Sam buried evidence of the past sexual history of a
                  woman Cady was accused of raping. In doing so, Cady was not afforded
                  the best possible defense. He was convicted and sentenced to
                  14 years in prison. The seduction and reaction of Sam's daughter,
                  Danny, by Cady, will be examined in light of Freudian theories
                  and thereby demonstrated as believable in its entirety. The relevant
                  parts of Freud's theories will be set out, and the characters'
                  actions discussed where they exemplify behavior that is expected
                  in certain psychosexual stages. Finally, the seduction of Danny
                  will be explored in further detail. <br>
<br>
                  There are five psychosexual stages of development experienced
                  by all children, and it is during these stages that adult personality
                  is determined (Hergenhahn, supra at 27-31). These are the oral,
                  anal, phallic, latency, and genital stages (Hergenhahn, supra
                  at 27). If an adult was over or under gratified at a stage as
                  a child, he/she will fixate at that period in development (Hergenhahn,
                  supra at 27-31). Fixation is accompanied by regression, as &quot;when
                  a person regresses, he or she tends to go back to the stage at
                  which that person had been fixated&quot; (Hergenhahn, supra at
                  27). <br>
<br>
                  First is the early oral stage that occurs in the child's first
                  year. It is here that a child derives pleasure from sucking and
                  swallowing (Hergenhahn, supra at 27). An adult who is fixated
                  at this stage will overly engage in activities such as &quot;drinking,
                  smoking, kissing, and eating&quot; or symbolically engage in
                  these activities by &quot;swallowing&quot; anything that he or
                  she hears (Hergenhahn, supra at 27). Later, from about 8 months
                  to a year, pleasure comes from &quot;biting and devouring&quot;.
                  One who is fixated at this stage into adulthood will engage in
                  biting activities or symbolically equivalent activities such
                  as sarcasm and ridicule (Hergenhahn, supra at 27). A person who
                  engages in activities involving biting is said to have an &quot;oral-sadistic
                  character&quot; (Hergenhahn, supra at 27). <br>
<br>
                  The anal stage is experienced during the second year of life
                  (Hergenhahn, supra at 27). In the first part of the stage, pleasure
                  is found in feces expulsion (Hergenhahn, supra at 28). Later,
                  pleasure is found in feces possession (Hergenhahn, supra at 28).
                  It is not a particularly important stage for this analysis, as
                  none of the characters seem to be fixated at this stage.<br>
<br>
                  Next, the three-to-five year old child experiences the phallic
                  stage, a particularly important stage to the relationships that
                  Danny has and develops. The main characteristic at this stage
                  for females is the Electra complex which &quot;involves the child's
                  unconscious desire to possess the opposite-sexed parent and to
                  eliminate the same-sexed one (D.B. Stevenson, Freud's Psychosexual
                  Stages of Development (1996), online: <a href="http://65.107.211.206/science/freud/Psychosexual_Development.html">The
                  Freud Web</a> (date accessed: 11 March 2003) [hereinafter Stevenson])&quot;.
                  It is a highly controversial theory and <br>
                  <i>[t]he complex has its roots in the little girl's discovery
                  that she, along with her mother and all other women, lack the
                  penis which her father and other men posses. Her love for her
                  father then becomes both erotic and envious, as she yearns for
                  a penis of her own. She comes to blame her mother for her perceived
                  castration, and is struck by penis envy</i> (Stevenson).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Then from the ages of about
                  six to twelve the &quot;latency stage&quot; (Hergenhahn, supra
                  at 29) is experienced. During this time, &quot;sexual interests
                  are displaced to substitute activities such as learning [and]
                  athletics&quot; (Hergenhahn, supra at 29). <br>
<br>
                  In the film, Danny is 15 years old and thus would be at the &quot;genital
                  stage&quot; (Hergenhahn, supra at 29) of development, where a
                  child turns to heterosexual interests. If there are unresolved
                  issues from other stages, a child will fixate on them for the
                  remainder of his or her life (Hergenhahn, supra at 29). This
                  is the final stage and the child should &quot;emerge as the as
                  the adult he/she is destined to become&quot; (Hergenhahn, supra
                  at 29).<br>
<br>
                  These are all the relevant areas of Freud's theories and the
                  seduction of Danny can now be analyzed in more detail. It is
                  likely that Danny has a fixation at the phallic stage, in part
                  due to her tumultuous relationship with her mother. In the opening
                  scenes of the movie, her mother tells the dog that &quot;they
                  switched babies on me at the hospital, didn't they?&quot; There
                  is a great deal of repressed anger between Danny and her mother.
                  The viewer does not see love or even friendship between the two
                  of them. Instead, the viewer sees resentment and a great deal
                  of passive-aggressive avoidance in their conversations. Danny
                  will pose questions, but then walk away and ignore the answer.
                  Danny continually needles her mother by acting in this manner,
                  possibly hoping to cause her mother to leave in frustration.
<br>
<br>
                  Danny's relationship with her father is also unsatisfactory for
                  her. Near the beginning of the film, we see the family out having
                  a snack at a diner after having been to a movie. In a very childish
                  manner, Danny is eating a dish of ice cream and play-fights with
                  her father. All is well until she tells Sam that &quot;he should
                  have 'punched out' that guy with the cigar in the theatre&quot;,
                  the man being Cady. Sam loses his temper and ends up with his
                  arm too held too tightly around Danny's neck, choking her. Danny
                  looks startled. This is the first time the viewer sees her love
                  for her father shunned by a violent act when speaking of Max
                  Cady. Danny must now find another father figure on which to bestow
                  her &quot;erotic and envious love&quot; (Stevenson, supra).<br>
<br>
                  Max Cady is a complex character. One of the first scenes in which
                  viewer is permitted to appraise him in a private moment is a
                  brutal rape scene of a woman, Lori, with whom Sam is having an
                  affair. Cady handcuffs her hands behind her back and then bites
                  a piece out of her cheek. This act is certainly more than symbolically
                  fixating at an oral stage, it is an outright demonstration of
                  Freud's oral-sadistic character. Throughout the movie, Max Cady
                  smokes a large cigar. This is an activity from which he derives
                  a great deal of pleasure, and another indication of his fixation
                  at the oral stage.<br>
<br>
                  Cady then becomes a menace to Sam and his family. Danny is made
                  privy to his identity and thereby the danger he poses. However,
                  he is able to capitalize on Danny's sexual development in the
                  genital stage and her fixation at the phallic stage. Cady poses
                  as her drama teacher and on the phone instructs her to &quot;[u]se
                  all that negativity. Go with it. The awkwardness you feel when
                  you're walking down the street and some leering fools make fun
                  of your sexuality, the turmoil you feel, when you feel extra
                  bad when that time of the month comes around.&quot; Certainly,
                  any young girl is uncomfortable when she first becomes aware
                  of herself as a sexual object, or when confronted by changes
                  in her body. It was thus not difficult for Cady to judge that
                  these would also be areas of anxiety for Danny. He then talks
                  about &quot;[t]he anger you feel at your mom and dad. They won't
                  let you grow up [to] be a woman. Go with it. Put that anger to
                  work.&quot; Certainly Danny has a great deal of anger against
                  her mother, stemming from, to Freud, her perceived castration
                  and want to eliminate her mother, as well as from the shunned
                  love of her father. Cady tells her that &quot;[y]ou can trust
                  me 'cause I'm a 'do right' man.&quot; Perhaps she has found her
                  substitute father figure.<br>
<br>
                  Cady is able to lure Danny to an isolated theatre in her summer
                  school the next day. When they meet, the setting is very dark,
                  and Cady smokes marijuana. At this moment, he has repressed his
                  need of a large phallic symbol for another item that can be smoked,
                  and thus satisfy his fixation. This item is not threatening to
                  Danny, as she has smoked marijuana before, and now smokes with
                  Cady. However, her mother has reprimanded her for smoking, and
                  so this act &quot;symbolizes her rebellion and alienation towards
                  her mother&quot; (Associate Professor A. Acorn, personal communication,
                  University of Alberta, March 2003). Cady knows this and exploits
                  the rift between mother and daughter. <br>
<br>
                  Cady begins to discuss books with sexual content. This is a subject
                  that should be of interest to Danny due to her genital stage
                  of development. He starts to build trust with her by recounting
                  the description of an erection from the book &quot;Tropic of
                  Cancer&quot;. Danny says that she had to sneak the book off her
                  parents' shelf. He then begins to illuminate her hostility towards
                  her parents, which he has now confirmed she has. He tells her
                  that &quot;[y]our parents don't want you to reach adult-hood&quot;.
                  He then senses that there is both enough trust of him, and hatred
                  of her parents, to divulge his real identity. He then reassures
                  her by saying that &quot;[t]here's no anger between us. Just
                  the search for truth. Did you judge me? Did you get angry at
                  me when you caught me smoking the grass? But your parents judged
                  you.&quot; A short while later, he tells Danny &quot;I think
                  I might have found a companion&quot;. This is excellent news
                  for Danny in her search for a father figure. <br>
<br>
                  Cady then asks to put his arm around her and she consents. She
                  feels safe. He touches her face and puts his thumb into her mouth.
                  She sucks on it- twice. This satisfies any regressed need for
                  oral fixation for both of them. They both passed through this
                  stage as children and know it well. In a stressful situation
                  such as that in which Danny found herself, there was a likelihood
                  of her regressing to this first stage in development. Additionally,
                  it is satisfying her want of &quot;erotic and envious love&quot;
                  (Stevenson ,supra) for a father figure and her curiosity of heterosexual
                  relationships.<br>
<br>
                  The next scene with Sam and Danny is when he bursts into her
                  room after learning she has spent time with Cady. Danny is having
                  a quiet moment alone, listening to music, as she lays on her
                  bed in her underwear. For Danny, it is a situation in which she
                  is comfortable and content. However, Sam yells at her to put
                  some clothes on, as she is &quot;not a little kid anymore&quot;.
                  He has now forever crushed any hope of her seeing him as an outlet
                  for her love. Danny argues with him and says &quot;[h]e didn't
                  force himself on me. I know you'd like to think he did. I think
                  he was just trying to make a connection with me.&quot; Sam responds
                  by yelling at her. He tells her &quot;[n]o! You understand? No.
                  There will never be a connection between you and Max Cady. Did
                  he touch you?&quot; Danny laughs and Sam tells her to &quot;[w]ipe
                  that smile off your face!&quot; He aggressively pushes his hand
                  over her mouth and pushes her violently into the bed. Danny starts
                  to cry. In sharp contrast, Max Cady had been so gentle with her,
                  filling all her unconscious needs and desires. Here her Father,
                  the man she should be bestowing her love on, is continually shunning
                  her and acting violently towards her. He violates her child-like
                  innocence by both telling her she is no longer a child and by
                  acting in such a hateful manner.<br>
<br>
                  Following this incident, Max Cady is safe in the sense that Danny
                  feels betrayed by her Father and therefore uses Cady as a substitute
                  on which to endow her &quot;erotic and envious love&quot; (Stevenson,
                  supra). Taken in its entirety, the seduction of Danny is believable.
                  Yet it is also frightening to realize that viewers of the film
                  are subject to the same unconscious desires, and that the Max
                  Cadys of the world may be able to gain an advantage in their
                  psychotic relationships by exploiting unconscious mechanisms.</font></p>
