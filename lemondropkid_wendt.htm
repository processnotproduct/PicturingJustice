                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bob Hope's movies may not be
                  subtle in terms of laughs, but they are subtle in terms of law
                  and legal issues.  As with the <i><a href="hope_wendt.htm">Son
                  of Paleface</a></i>, the legal issues in <i>The Lemon Drop Kid</i>
                  are almost hidden in the backdrop in terms of laughter.  With
                  <i>The Lemon Drop Kid</i> you have issues of: gambling; aliases;
                  debt collection; usury; mobsters; casinos, licenses to practice
                  medicine; creative accounting, tax issues, licenses for charities;
                  evictions, kidnapping, business organizations; and even gifts
                  given under duress. </font></p>

                  remake of the 1934 film, this 1951 classic is based on a story
                  by Damon Runyon:</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> &quot;This is a racetrack
                  in Florida, Damon Runyon frequented such racetracks, for it was
                  there that he met many of the people that he wrote about&#133;.horseowners,
                  trainers, jockeys, grooms, gamblers, pickpockets.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There are many sources from
                  which those who bet receive their information, about the horses,
                  Damon Runyon wrote about an interesting source of mis-information
                  called &quot;The Lemon Drop Kid.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It's a story of the Lemon Drop
                  Kid (Bob Hope) stuck between the law and mobsters and a beautiful
                  girlfriend/fianc&eacute;e.  Hope plays a racetrack tout, Sidney
                  Melbourne that more often goes by the name of &quot;The Lemon
                  Drop Kid&quot; named after his love of the candy.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Living literally from tip to
                  tip, at the Florida track the Kid offers tips to rubes with the
                  promise that when &quot;their&quot; horse wins, they will return
                  the favor to the Kid in the form of a percentage of their winnings.
                   Of course, the Kid covers the entire field to cover his own
                  bets.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As one of his schemes he even
                  hides a lemon drop behind his ear so that it looks like a horse
                  is giving him a tip.  When accosted by the local constabulary
                  the Kid tells them that even if was true that he was touting
                  it will tough for them to prove in court. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Cop: &quot;C'mon, Kid.  Let's
                  go.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid: &quot;Why?  What am I
                  doing?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Cop:  &quot;Touting again.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid: (Pointing to the horse
                  that just ate the lemon drop from behind his ear) &quot;Touting?
                   Him?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Cop: &quot;Now listen, Kid.
                   We've seen you use some pretty wild schemes.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid: &quot;Why?  Is it a crime
                  that this horse has a sweet tooth for lemon drops?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Cop:  &quot;Yeah, but you're
                  using it so that these crazy horse players will think the horse
                  is giving you a tip.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;Oh, you know it,
                  and I know it, and the horse knows it.  But, it will sound pretty
                  peculiar in court.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">However, the Kid is soon in
                  bigger trouble when he mistakenly gives a bad tip (&quot;bet
                  on Lightning Streak&quot;) to Stella (Andrea King) the moll of
                  mobster Moose Moran (Fred Clark).  Of course, Lightning Streak
                  literally walks in last and Ironbar, Moose's original bet, wins.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Kid runs to the cops to
                  arrest him to keep him from Moose, but the local cops say:</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;Put me in jail!
                   Please put me in jail!&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Cop:  &quot;Are you kidding?
                   What kind of new racket is this?  Are you trying to make chumps
                  out of us?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;Well, I'm a citizen.
                   I pay taxes.  I've got a right to be put in jail!  Slap them
                  (handcuffs) on me&#133;&#133;Now, I just touted Moose Moran by
                  mistake.  I touted him off a winner.  He'll kill me!&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Cop: &quot;Well, you know it
                  and we know it and Moose Moran knows it.  But, it will sound
                  very peculiar in court.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Moose's thugs grab the Kid
                  and Moose wants him to pay up $10,000 even though the bet was
                  for $2,000.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;10 Grand!  But
                  I thought you only lost 2.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Moose:  &quot;Yeah, but the
                  horse won!  He would have paid me 10 Grand.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Moose:  &quot;It's not the
                  money.  I just don't like having all the smart guys get the laugh
                  on me.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Moose introduces the Kid to
                  one of his special thugs, who specializes in taking things out
                  of people, Sam the Surgeon (Harry Bellaver).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid: (to Sam)  &quot;Are you
                  a genuine doctor?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sam:  &quot;Practically.  Would
                  have graduated if I didn't drop a forward pass my senior year.&quot;
                  (A comment on intercollegiate athletics?)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Kid stalls for some time
                  and Moose gives the Kid until Christmas to pay back the money
                  he lost or Sam the Surgeon will &quot;open&quot; the Kid for
                  Christmas.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;It's all the same
                  to you whether Sam kills me now or doesn't open me 'til Christmas.
                   And if I get the money you're 10 Grand ahead.  You see, Moose,
                  picking up 10 Grand will be fun for you and killing me will be
                  so sloppy.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Moose:  &quot;Dead, I write
                  10 Grand off the books.  Alive, a possible asset.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sam:  &quot;What if he runs
                  away?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Moose:  &quot;We'll find him.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;Yeah, I hear you
                  can find people so good that after you find them nobody else
                  can find them.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Moose:  &quot;Kid, I've got
                  some property in Long Island, a casino.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;Oh, I know the
                  place.  They closed it down for repairs.  The roulette wheel
                  started paying off.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Moose:  &quot; I'm coming up
                  north to peddle it.  You have the money for me Christmas Eve
                  or Christmas morning you'll find your head in your stocking.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">With only weeks until Christmas
                  the Kid flees to New York and sees various Santa Clauses on the
                  corners raising money.  The Kid dons a Santa costume to raise
                  money to save a life, namely his own.  Busted by the police for
                  panhandling he is hauled into court where the bailiff calls.
                  &quot;Sidney Melbourne, Sidney Melbourne.&quot;  The Kid has
                  been using his alias so long that he doesn't even recognize his
                  own name.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid: &quot;Panhandling!  I
                  was standing on a corner with my bell and kettle like hundred
                  of other everyday, average, American Santies.&quot; </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Judge:  &quot;You were collecting
                  money for your own personal gain.  Those other men are working
                  for charity.  It's an organized charity and has a city license.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In court he also sees his old
                  friend Nellie Thursday (Jane Darwell) who is being taken to court
                  for nonpayment of rent and now being evicted. Nellie can't get
                  into an old folks home because her husband, (Henry, Sing Sing,
                  Class of '31 and the greatest little safecracker) is a con. 
                  And after 20 years he's being paroled on Christmas Eve </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/lemondropkid2.jpg" width="177" height="135" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Sprung
                  on bail by his fianc&eacute;e, Brainey (Marilyn Maxwell) so that
                  they can get married, the Kid again buys some time because he
                  comes up with just the right scam - Christmas Collections for
                  a legitimate charity, the &quot;Nellie Thursday Home for Old
                  Dolls.&quot;  The home is located in Moose Moran's closed casino.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">When Sam the Surgeon pays the
                  Kid a visit, the Kid reveals his true intentions, i.e. to make
                  off with the donations and pay off his debt to Moose.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;You know Nellie
                  Thursday.  She's in here.  She's got no place to live.  She tried
                  to get into an old folks home, but they wouldn't take her on
                  account of her husband's an ex-con.  Now, here's the idea.  I
                  borrow Moose's casino.  I pretend it's an old folks home.  I
                  stick Nellie in there with a bunch of old dolls.  With them in
                  it&#133;Now, this part is kind of tough, but I figure if I can
                  work it out I can pop the city into giving me a license to collect
                  for charity.  I further figure I can get every mug on Broadway
                  to help me do the collecting.  They all love Nellie.  She's such
                  a grand, old doll.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sam:  &quot;You're trying to
                  unload a mob of old dolls on Moose's casino?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;Shhh!  It's only
                  until Christmas Eve.  By then I've collected enough to pay off
                  Moose.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sam:  &quot;This is the most
                  legal double cross I've ever heard.  But, what happens to the
                  old dolls after Christmas Eve?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;Oh well.  Can I
                  help it if suddenly the collection money gets lost and the old
                  dolls can't afford to stay in the casino?  Moose will have the
                  dough and I'll be in the clear.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sam:  &quot;You're doing to
                  dump all those nice old ladies out on the street at Christmas
                  time!  I wouldn't do that to my own mother.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;Any bookie in town
                  would give you 3 to 1.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Kid and his friends bring
                  Nellie Thursday to her new home in Moose's casino and the place
                  that used to be for swells now has the motto that &quot;Any broken
                  old doll on Broadway is welcome.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Brainey:  &quot;You remember
                  Mrs. Baumgarden.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;Singing Solly's
                  mother-in-law.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Brainey:  &quot;Singing Solly
                  donated her.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;Yeah, she'd be
                  much happier here.  It always a strain on a marriage - a married
                  couple with a mother.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Mrs. Baumgarden:  &quot;Yeah,
                  but it was my house!&quot;<br>
                  	<br>
                  The Kid enlists some pals to hit the street corners of New York
                  dressed as Santas accepting donations for Nellie Thursday's Home.
                   Only Damon Runyon could come up with characters such as Straight
                  Flush (Jay C. Flippen), Gloomy Willie (William Frawley), Little
                  Louie (Sid Melton), Singing Solly (Ben Welden), Goomba (Charles
                  Cooley), Super Swedish Angel (Tor Johnson), No Thumbs Charlie
                  (Tom Dugan) and, of course, Society Kid Hogan played by -- Society
                  Kid Hogan.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Society Kid:  &quot;I thought
                  I was supposed to be Santy Clause&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;Santy Clause -
                  Kris Kringle - St. Nick.  It's all the same guy!&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Society Kid:  &quot;Oh, I get
                  it!  He don't give his right name, either!&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Gloomy (William Frawley), as
                  one of the street corner Santas, probably has the best line of
                  the movie.  A little girl asks him (as Santa) if he is coming
                  to her house and, &quot;Are you going to bring a doll?&quot;
                   Gloomy says, &quot;No, my doll's working Christmas Eve.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Another highlight of the film
                  is the classic Christmas song, Silver Bells.  Gloomy has his
                  own version:  <br>
                  &quot;Silver Bells, Silver Bells.<br>
                  Let's put some dough in the kitty.<br>
                  Chunk it in, Chunk it in,<br>
                  Or Santy will give you a mickey&#133;&#133;.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the meantime, Brainey's
                  boss, Oxford Charlie (Lloyd Nolan wearing size 14AAAA Oxfords)
                  has decided to muscle into the racket.  Oxford Charlie has income
                  tax problems of his own and owes the government over $31,000.
                   (&quot;You mean to say all that dough I pay for protection ain't
                  deductible!)  He also finds out that collecting is big money
                  and kidnaps Nellie, Brainey and the old dolls.  &quot;I know
                  that the license is made out to the 'Nellie Thursday Home.' 
                  So I figure wherever Nellie Thursday is, that's 'The Nellie Thursday
                  Home!'&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Nellie escapes from Oxford
                  Charlie and the Kid sees her trying to hock her wedding ring
                  to raise some money for Henry.  The Kid has seen the error of
                  his ways and sets a trap at the casino/old dolls home for Moose
                  and Oxford Charlie.  Moose gets arrested for operating a gambling
                  joint and Oxford Charlie for trying to run away with the charity
                  money.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Ever the touter, the Kid thanks
                  the Judge:</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Judge:  &quot;And I'm going
                  to keep an eye on you, Mr. Melbourne.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kid:  &quot;You won't have
                  to, Judge.  I'm turning over a new leaf.  I'll never be caught
                  again!  Say, thanks for everything, Judge.  If you ever want
                  a winner, just call me.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So, in the end, the old dolls,
                  Nellie and Henry get the home (with a built in safe for Henry),
                  the bad guys go to jail and Kid gets the girl.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Often when looking at law and
                  the underworld, Fritz Lang's classic <i>M</i> is the still the
                  film to be dissected and examined, but there is a role for comedy
                  and the law and that's what you have with <i>The Lemon Drop Kid</i>,
                  a true comedy classic.</font></p>
