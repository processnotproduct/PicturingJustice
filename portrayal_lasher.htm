                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The portrayal of lawyers and
                  the legal system in film has changed considerably since the 1970's.
                   As discussed in Michael Asimow's <i>Bad Lawyers in the Movies</i>,
                  24 Nova L.R. 533 (2000), films since the 1970's have portrayed
                  lawyers in a negative light.  And women attorneys are no exception
                  to this trend.<br>
                   <br>
                  <img src="images/adamsrib.jpg" width="149" height="201" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Prior to the 1970's, only a handful
                  of films actually portrayed women as attorneys.  One of the most
                  famous films depicting a woman as an attorney is <i>Adam's Rib</i>
                  (Turner Entertainment Co., 1949) a comedy made in the 1940's.
                   In <i>Adam's Rib</i>, Katharine Hepburn portrays a spirited
                  female attorney, Amanda Bonner, who is married to a local prosecutor,
                  Adam (Spencer Tracy).  Both spouses face each other in the courtroom
                  when Amanda defends a woman who has been charged with attempted
                  murder of her husband, and Adam prosecutes the case.  Some critics
                  argue, that Amanda's courtroom antics, and not her intelligence,
                  allowed her to win the case.  This is highlighted, in one courtroom
                  scene when Adam criticizes Amanda's arguments starting: &quot;First
                  of all, I should like to say that I think the arguments advanced
                  by counsel were sound . . . MERE sound.&quot;  But, in my opinion,
                  Amanda is portrayed as a creative trial advocate who is gutsy
                  and intelligent both inside and outside the courtroom.  For a
                  film made in the 1940's, Amanda's character is extremely independent
                  and self-sufficient.  Amanda has a driver's license (though Adam
                  is unnerved by her driving habits), Amanda shares household responsibilities
                  with Adam (and the maid), and Amanda has her own practice.  More
                  importantly, Amanda is driven to free her client because she
                  observes that there is a sexual double-standard at play and the
                  case offers her an opportunity to showcase a woman's inherent
                  constitutional right to justice.  However, like many contemporary
                  films portraying women in positions of power, Amanda's marriage
                  suffers as a result of her taking the case against her husband.
                   Despite this, Amanda's portrayal of a female attorney is probably
                  one of the best we have seen to date.  <br>
                   <br>
                  In the late 1970's, women's roles as attorneys in film became
                  more evident.  This is due, in large part, to the growing number
                  of females entering the law profession.  For example, polls show
                  that in the 1960's female attorneys comprised 3% of the associate
                  population, by the 1980's they comprised about 20% of the associates,
                  and by the 1990's they made up almost 40% of the associate population
                  (See Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, et al., <i>Glass Ceiling and Open
                  Doors:</i> <i>Women's Advancement in the Legal Profession</i>,
                  64 Fordham L.Rev. 291, 313-314 (1995)).<br>
                   <br>
                  There have been several changes in the portrayal of female attorneys
                  since the 1970's.  First, women attorneys are now portrayed as
                  main characters in film.  Second, while there has been an increase
                  in the number of women attorneys both in film and in practice
                  since the 1970's, female attorneys in film, like their male counterparts,
                  have generally been portrayed in a negative light.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">One film that incorporates
                  practically all of the images discussed above, and challenges
                  the protagonist to make many ethical decisions is <i>Class Actio</i>n
                  (20th Century Fox, 1991).  In this film, Maggie Ward (Mary Mastrantonio)
                  works for a large firm doing primarily defense work.  Throughout
                  the film, Maggie's actions as an attorney are contrasted with
                  her father's actions as a plaintiff's attorney.  Jed Ward (Gene
                  Hackman) is a reputable, liberal lawyer whose most celebrated
                  case is representing a whistleblower.  The importance of gender
                  roles appears in opening scenes, which switches between two courtroom
                  scenes.  In one courtroom, Maggie argues a motion to dismiss.
                   She focuses on the &quot;black letter law,&quot; and even informs
                  the judge that &quot;appeals to emotion have no place in a court
                  of law.&quot;  Jed, in contrast, appeals to the jurors' emotions
                  when arguing his case in the adjoining courtroom.  In the courtroom,
                  and throughout most of the film, Maggie is surrounded by male
                  associates, which is accentuated by the fact that there is no
                  other woman who has the same occupational status in her firm.
                   The image portrayed by this is that Maggie is isolated from
                  her female peers.  The climax of the film occurs when Maggie
                  aligns herself with her father after she discovers that her supervising
                  partner, with whom she has been having an affair, has used his
                  status with her to cover-up material evidence pertinent in the
                  lawsuit.  In the end, Maggie changes her personal life by trusting
                  her emotions, but not without sacrificing her legal career.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Probably one of the best films
                  portraying an attorney who makes a bad judgment in character
                  is <i>Jagged Edge</i> (Columbia Pictures, 1985).  In this film
                  Teddy Barnes (Glen Close), a former prosecutor turned civil defense
                  attorney, represents her firm's biggest and wealthiest client
                  who has been charged with murdering his wife.  Barnes, like many
                  other female attorneys portrayed in film, is divorced.  During
                  the course of trial preparation, Barnes leaps into bed with her
                  client.  Instead of withdrawing as counsel, Barnes continues
                  to represent her client and becomes conflicted when she learns
                  that her client, now lover, may have in fact been the murderer.
                   Barnes is able to get her client acquitted, but after the trial,
                  Barnes accidentally discovers the identity of the murderer. 
                  Instead of reporting this information to the police or prosecutor,
                  Barnes takes matters into her own hands.  In the end, justice
                  is served, but not without Barnes potentially sacrificing her
                  legal career.<br>
                   <br>
                  Barnes' colleagues fare no better when confronted with ethical
                  dilemmas, particularly when it comes to sexual relationships.
                   In <i>And Justice For All</i> (Malton Films, 1979), attorney
                  Gail Packer (Christine Lahti) has an affair with fellow attorney
                  Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino) even though she is a member of the
                  state bar ethics committee that is investigating Kirkland.  And,
                  in <i>Suspect</i> (Tri-Star Pictures, 1987), Kathleen Riley (Cher)
                  is a burnt-out public defender who has a lonely personal life
                  until she teams up with a juror on her case to solve the murder.
                   And to push our professional code of ethics completely over
                  the line, Riley sleeps with the juror in the process.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Music Box</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> (Carolco Pictures, 1990) is a good
                  example of a female attorney who becomes so driven by her emotions
                  that she loses power over her case.  In this movie, Ann Talbot
                  (Jessica Lange) is a successful criminal attorney who is divorced
                  but has an amicable relationship with her father-in-law.  In
                  the beginning of the film, Talbot is portrayed as a tough and
                  skilled litigator.  The opening scenes of the movie demonstrate
                  Talbot's ability to win cases for her defendants, while maintaining
                  a safe separation from her clients.  However, when Talbot's father
                  receives a notice of deportation, which is based on the government's
                  allegations that Talbot's father had lied on his citizenship
                  application, Talbot agrees to represent her father.  Talbot's
                  father is accused of being a notorious Nazi SS officer responsible
                  for hideous war crimes during World War II.  Talbot's father
                  plays heavily on her emotions and Talbot is ultimately unable
                  to remain emotionally detached from the case, and seeks the assistance
                  of her former father-in-law.  Ultimately her father-in-law's
                  tip, along with another anonymous tip, allows the case against
                  her father to be dropped.  Though this film plays heavily on
                  the loss of power women in film feel when they rely on their
                  emotions, the film offers some redemption when Talbot finally
                  faces the truth about her father and turns evidence implicating
                  her father over to the special prosecutor.  <br>
                   <br>
                  The film that best depicts a woman attorney as striving to obtain
                  justice without confronting serious ethical dilemmas is <i>The
                  Client</i> (Warner Bros., 1994).  In this movie Reggie Love (Susan
                  Sarandon) is a successful female attorney, who agrees to represent
                  a young boy who inadvertently knows too much about a Mafia killing.
                   While there has been some criticism that the young boy Love
                  represents saves her from stereotypical female emotional reactions,
                  Love actually exemplifies a contemporary female attorney who
                  is competent, passionate, and ethical.  Although Love is a recovering
                  alcoholic, the film focuses more on her defending the young boy
                  and keeping him from harm.  And, unlike most female protagonists,
                  Love is portrayed as almost a hero by the end of the film when
                  she helps her client obtain justice.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Since the mid-1990's, there
                  have been few films portraying female attorneys as the main character.
                   Nevertheless, through the use of female attorneys in minor roles,
                  several other films have demonstrated that a new trend in the
                  portrayal of women attorneys is emerging.  I suggest that this
                  trend, which portrays women as more independent and less reliant
                  on their male colleagues, is a more accurate depiction of a female
                  attorney today.  For example, in <i>Legally Blonde</i> (MGM,
                  2001), Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), an LA valley girl who
                  resembles a Barbie-doll, loses her boyfriend to Harvard Law School.
                   Woods is determined to win him back by getting a law degree
                  herself.  Her first year of law school is supposed to resemble
                  the modern day version of <i>The Paper Chase</i>.  And, while
                  certain aspects of the film are unrealistic, this departs from
                  the older films by showing a female protagonist who is able to
                  overcome her personal life and succeed professionally.  Also,
                  the film departs from earlier films by using a female law professor
                  as Woods's role model.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Whether future films will continue
                  the trend away from the traditional model of a female attorney
                  established in the 1970's and 1980's, it appears that, no matter
                  how they are portrayed, female attorneys will continue to play
                  an important role in film.  While the jury is still out about
                  whether law is a reflection of our society or simply impacts
                  our perceptions, there is no doubt that law, with all its strengths
                  and weaknesses, is reflected most boldly and largely on the silver
                  screen.</font></p>
