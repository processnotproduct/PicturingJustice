            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by John Denvir</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">We too often remember Quentin
            Tarantino's films for their images of violence. The image of
            a thug slicing off a policeman's ear in <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>
            is a hard one to forget-even though it never appears in the movie.
            The actual mutilation takes place off screen, a fact that indicates
            Tarantino is interested in more than violence for violence's
            sake. I find <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> more interesting as a movie
            about justice than one about violence. Tarantino's idea of justice
            has little to do the &quot;legal justice system&quot; with its
            juries and prisons and such, but with justice as the hope that
            everyone gets what they deserve, their just deserts. Each of
            the film's main characters is motivated by a sense of justice,
            but what justice demands varies dramatically from individual
            to individual and these differing perceptions lead inevitably
            to violence.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/reservoirdogs.jpg" width="113" height="177" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Since
            most readers have not seen the film recently, I would like to
            start with a short plot summary to refresh our memories. <i>Reservoir
            Dogs</i> is a &quot;heist&quot; film, or more accurately, a &quot;heist
            gone bad&quot; film. A group of crooks plans a robbery of a jewelry
            warehouse. Tipped off by an undercover policeman (Tim Roth as
            Mr. Orange) who has infiltrated the gang, the police show up
            to interrupt the robbery. Two of the gang are killed and another
            (the same Mr. Orange) is seriously wounded. <br>
<br>
            We pick up the action when Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) is bringing
            the &quot;gut-shot&quot; Mr. Orange to a deserted warehouse where
            the gang had agreed to meet after the heist. They are met there
            first by Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) and a little later by Mr. Blonde
            (Michael Madsen) who has brought with him a tied-up policeman
            the gang members hope can identify the snitch. They are soon
            joined by Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn), the gang leader's son
            and deputy, who assigns Blonde to guard the prisoner while he,
            White, and Pink retrieve the jewels.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">When Blonde is alone, he proceeds
            to torture his captive. He candidly explains that he doesn't
            care whether the policeman tells him the truth or not; it just
            amuses him to torture a cop. This is where the ear slicing takes
            place. He also intends to burn his victim alive. Just before
            Blonde is able to set the policeman aflame, he is shot dead by
            Orange who he had mistakenly believed was unconscious. Nice Guy
            Eddie, White, and Pink return, soon joined by the gang's leader
            Joe (Lawrence Tierney). Joe has no doubt about the identity of
            the informer; he &quot;knows&quot; it is Orange because Orange
            is the only one he had not worked with for years. He pulls out
            his gun to execute Orange, only to be confronted by Mr. White
            who claims that Orange is innocent. He asks Joe what his proof
            is, but Joe responds. &quot;You don't need proof when you have
            instinct.&quot; White draws his gun and tells Joe that if he
            shoots Orange, he will shoot Joe. At which point Nice guy Eddie
            draws his gun and tells White that if he shoots his dad, he will
            shoot him. A triple shoot-out ensues, leaving both Joe and Nice
            Guy Eddie dead.<br>
<br>
            At this point Mr. Pink decides to leave with the jewels, feeling
            risking capture by the cops is safer than remaining with his
            homicidal colleagues. That leaves Mr. White and Mr. Orange. Orange
            knows that the police are about to arrive to rescue him and arrest
            White, but still he tells White &quot; I'm a cop. I'm sorry,
            terribly sorry.&quot; At this point the police enter the building
            and shoot White dead, but not before he kills Orange. <br>
<br>
            We can see five different conceptions of justice operating here,
            each motivating a different character. Mr. Blonde represents
            the first conception of justice. White is a psychopath who has
            already killed a whole slew of warehouse employees during the
            robbery. He clearly enjoys mutilating the cop for no better reason
            than the enjoyment he experiences torturing a cop. This seems
            more like sadism than justice. But in Blonde's defense, we must
            admit he would not complain if the policeman held the knife and
            acted the same way towards him. Justice to White is no more or
            less than inflicting pain on your enemy as circumstances allow.<br>
<br>
            Joe represents another idea of justice, the charismatic leader's
            justice. Joe is the gang's boss, the man who gives the orders.
            It's Joe who insisted that all the participants in the actual
            robbery take the names of colors to keep their true identities
            secret. He's an affectionate, generous man towards his workers,
            but insists on total obedience. He takes responsibility for the
            group's success and claims the right to decide questions of guilt
            and punishment. He figures Orange must be the snitch since Orange
            is the only new man on the job. No more need of proof than that.
            Once he makes that decision, permitting opposition would be perceived
            as a sign of weakness, undermining his authority. Orange is a
            dead man.<br>
<br>
            Consider the difference between Joe's idea of justice and that
            of Mr. Pink. Mr. Pink is the individualist in the group, always
            thinking about what will profit him personally. But he too is
            bound by an idea of proper conduct toward his fellows, an idea
            that appears to be driven by the idea of contract. He is willing
            to perform any obligations he has voluntarily undertaken, but
            nothing beyond the terms of the contract. Tarantino allows Pink
            to explain his ideas in a very funny monologue about why Pink
            doesn't tip waitresses. They are paid to serve the food; he has
            agreed to pay the bill. He hasn't agreed to add a tip and chooses
            not to. The fact that &quot;society&quot; wishes to place this
            nonconsensual burden on him does not move him in the least. He's
            also supremely indifferent to his colleagues' arguments that
            waitresses need the money. If they don't like the pay, they should
            find a new job. <br>
<br>
            Yet Pink believes himself a professional and acts like one. For
            instance, he rescues the diamonds and rather than abscond with
            them brings them to the rendez-vous as agreed. He is also the
            first to realize someone must have tipped off the cops and insists
            they discuss rationally what to do next to identify the snitch.
            Pink's idea of justice seems a bit hard-hearted, but we must
            admit that in the end, it's Pink who escapes alive with the diamonds
            so maybe his self-interested approach has more advantages than
            his more passionate colleagues realize.<br>
<br>
            Mr. White and Mr. Orange both exhibit morally more ambitious
            conceptions of justice than the others. White feels that his
            relationship with his fellow crooks gives them a claim on his
            sympathy. Not willing to be bound by the letter of their agreement,
            White reacts spontaneously to Orange's injury and feels something
            should be done to relieve his pain. This empathy with suffering
            should not surprise us; it was White who was enraged by Pink's
            hard-heartedness towards waitresses. He takes responsibility
            for Orange because Orange is his colleague and (he thinks) friend.
            Unfortunately, this need for human connection makes White less
            &quot;professional&quot; than Pink by giving Orange information
            that the cop plans to use against him. Also Tarantino cleverly
            undercuts White's stance by showing how easily he has been fooled
            by the undercover cop. It turns out that White has killed his
            friend Joe to save a man who knows that the police are coming
            in a few minutes to arrest them all, including White. Empathy
            that is not mediated by prudence can be dangerous.<br>
<br>
            That leaves Mr. Orange who goes beyond even White to embrace
            what I will call a &quot;redemptive&quot; concept of justice.
            When we meet Orange he is quite a cocky young undercover detective
            who likes his &quot;super-cool&quot; job playing cops and robbers.
            It's only when the blood, including his own, starts to flow that
            he realizes that law enforcement impacts heavily on human lives.
            In order to stop a burglary that only involved the theft of insured
            diamonds, he has set in motion a series of events that will result
            in several deaths, including his own. After the shootout when
            his protector White crawls to his side, he has a decision to
            make. Should he remain silent and wait for the police or confess
            his perfidy. Remaining silent is clearly the smart move, but
            he can't do it. White's caring for him has created a personal
            bond he can't ignore. He feels responsible for the pain he has
            caused. Forgiveness-, self-forgiveness- requires action. &quot;I'm
            a cop. I'm sorry, terribly sorry.&quot; This is a call for his
            own death, but one he feels compelled to give. <br>
<br>
            I think there are some lessons we can take away from this film.
            First, the need to act according to some idea of justice seems
            hard-wired into the human brain. Crooks are just as justice-obsessed
            as the police who pursue them. Secondly, this need for justice
            does not break down neatly into procedural and substantive components
            the way law school teaches us. It concerns what we owe our fellows.
            Thirdly, individual and group disputes, like Joe and White's,
            often stem, not from an opposition of justice to injustice, but
            differing ideas of what justice requires. Maybe this realization
            could make us more understanding of our enemies' motivations.
            We should recognize that none of us operate from a pure concept
            of justice, but rather an amalgam of these five conceptions and
            probably many more. For instance, Pink thinks himself a rationalist,
            but enters into kicking the defenseless cop with abandon just
            like Blonde. Do we not, like Blonde, enjoy our enemies' pain?
            Or like Joe, prefer submission to our authority to the rigors
            of proof? Pink's attempt to determine what obligations he has
            voluntarily assumed is also an everyday experience. So too we
            are inspired by White's taking responsibility for his fellow's
            welfare and admire, if not wholly understand, Orange's need to
            atone for his misdeeds. In the end, we may find that &quot;justice&quot;
            turns out to be &quot;just us.&quot;<br>
