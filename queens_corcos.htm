                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">CBS has launched yet another
                  legal drama, <i>Queens Supreme</i>, set in New York City's trial
                  court system. The title derives from the borough (Queens) and
                  the name of the court involved (in New York State trial courts
                  are called &quot;supreme&quot; courts.) Like the short lived
                  <i>First Monday</i> and <i>The Court</i>, <i>Queens Supreme</i>
                  revolves around the lives and work of judges-unlike the two former
                  series, which simply could not make interesting drama out of
                  the talking heads that populate Appellate Court Land, this new
                  show presents us with trial judges and trial courts, that offer
                  much more in the way of legal conflict likely to seem relevant
                  to the average television viewer.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/queens2.jpg" width="129" height="187" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Is <i>Queens Supreme</i> more
                  successful in its presentation of the law and its effects? So
                  far, I give the show a qualified yes. The acting is very, very
                  good. The ensemble cast keeps the sparks flying. As liberal,
                  quirky, off the wall Jack Moran, Oliver Platt (<i>Married to
                  the Mob, Flatliners, Working Girl</i>) presents us with a convincing
                  picture of a power-obsessed, principle-obsessed jurist.  Kristen
                  Johnson (<i>3d Rock from the Sun</i>) made a  striking guest
                  appearance in the premiere episode as his estranged wife, prowling
                  the corridors looking for him, or rather his signature, on divorce
                  papers.  L. Scott Caldwell is efficient and cranky as Judge Rose
                  Barnea, concerned about her colleagues' problems but more about
                  their likely effect on the trial docket.  Robert Loggia, a veteran
                  film actor, is on hand as Judge Thomas O'Neill. Carmen Hui and
                  James Madio as judicial clerks suggest the combination of loyalty
                  and dissatisfaction that afflicts capable but overworked and
                  underappreciated aides.  The first episode features a stressed-out
                  juror tired of the deadlock over a verdict and desperate for
                  a smoke who takes over the courtroom until his fellow jurors
                  and the judge give him  1) a cigarette and 2) a verdict. Does
                  his admittedly extreme reaction represent the unhappiness that
                  jurors may feel over the seemingly endless dance that the legal
                  system engages in? Yes. Is it realistic? No, but who watches
                  television for realism?<br>
<br>
                  Well, to some extent, I do, and here I part company with the
                  show's writers. <i>Queens Supreme</i>  serves up a number of
                  unappetizing stereotypes that reflect but also exaggerate reality.
                  Both Moran and Barnea are overbearing and bossy folks whose intense
                  interest in their own positions suggests that justice takes a
                  back seat to ego.  The clerks are so incredibly competent that
                  we don't understand why they haven't moved on to better paying,
                  higher status positions in the legal world (maybe the writers
                  will let us know as the series goes on).  And the second episode,
                  which was actually the show's pilot, and introducing Annabella
                  Sciorra as new judge Kim Vicidomini (whose name no one can pronounce)
                  also introduces that age-old cat fight scenario between women
                  lawyers, in this case Vicidomini and Barnea. Vicidomini seems
                  to have gotten her position through political connections; Barnea
                  resents this and says so, both behind Vicidomini's back and to
                  her face. Realistic? Possibly, although I find it difficult to
                  believe that sitting judges would welcome a new colleague by
                  telling her they consider her incompetent.  Barnea makes clear
                  that no sisterhood exists, particularly since Vicidomini is (gasp)
                  a Republican. But Moran, the left winger, immediately takes to
                  Vicidomini, setting up, we assume, more drama to come. In addition,
                  Vicidomini seems to be far more politically savvy than most of
                  the young lawyers I know-but maybe that's why she got her appointment.
<br>
<br>
                  Further, in both of the first two episodes, Moran's penchant
                  for &quot;packing heat&quot; is a major part of the plot. This
                  liberal carries a gun into his courtroom, although he doesn't
                  use it until the second show.  He does, however, show it to the
                  angry juror in the first episode, a relevation that one would
                  have expected would lead to a resolution of the standoff long
                  before police finally storm the courtroom. It's somewhat disturbing
                  to consider that the drama in the first two episodes centers
                  on whether one of the major characters is going to spray a courtroom
                  with bullets, especially when he is supposed to represent the
                  rule of law. <br>
<br>
                  Another recurring plot dynamic is the use of the &quot;judges'
                  bathroom&quot; in which the judges can spy on their juries. Ever
                  since the unisex room in <i>Ally McBeal</i>, bathroom humor has
                  achieved new status. Clips from the new comedy <i><a href="http://tv.zap2it.com/shows/video/insidetv/insidetv_ausa.html">A.U.S.A</a></i>.
                  also demonstrate &quot;bathroom humor&quot;: apparently in one
                  episode a young lawyer accidentally gets water on a certain part
                  of his trousers and is caught by a judge as he tries to dry his
                  garment using one of those handy blow dryers.  Another preview
                  clip shows the new attorneys learning about weaponry. Are bathrooms
                  and guns now to be permanent fixtures in lawyer dramas?<br>
<br>
                  Most of the judges I know refuse to watch any of the &quot;judge
                  shows&quot; on television, on the grounds that such shows are
                  necessarily unrepresentative of what jurists actually do. It's
                  quite understandable.<br>
<br>
                  Whether or not <i>Queens Supreme</i> lasts the rest of the season,
                  and I doubt it will make it much past the third or fourth episode,
                  lawyer shows will not be in short supply. In fact, NBC plans
                  to launch a new comedy, also set in New York,  <i>A. U. S. A.</i>,
                  (for <i>Assistant United States Attorneys</i>) in February. Hope,
                  and lawyers, spring eternal. <br>
