                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Paul Bergman</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As the curtain rises on the
                  new season of <i>The Practice</i>, the familiar cast has radically
                  changed.  Bobby Donnell's law firm has been purged of Donnell
                  himself as well as Lindsey Dole and Rebecca Washington.  Like
                  most law firm breakups, money was the cause.  Apparently ABC
                  is paying less per episode (given the poor ratings of last year's
                  show) and David Kelley's production company has sliced payroll.
                   Also history are DA Helen Gamble and receptionist Lucy Hatcher.
                   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/practice03.jpg" width="196" height="132" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">However,
                  a new lawyer has emerged: Alan Shore (James Spader).  Shore claims
                  to have been a very successful antitrust lawyer in a large corporate
                  law firm.  However, he's left that firm after admittedly embezzling
                  funds (it was half Robin Hood-he stole from the rich but kept
                  the money for himself).  This admission doesn't stop Eleanor
                  Frutt  from immediately assigning him to defend a vagrant facing
                  a misdemeanor battery charge for kissing a haughty businesswoman.
                   Shore soon discovers that the law firm is no longer one of the
                  premiere criminal defense firms in the city-they are struggling
                  to survive with their biggest rainmaker (Bobby Donnell) off on
                  his own.  In fact, the firm can't even front the price of a new
                  suit for the client.  So Shore has to lend him a suit and shoes.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The show's strongest story
                  involved a criminal defense by Jimmy Berluti and Eugene Young
                  of a black woman charged with murdering a cocaine dealer who
                  lived on her block.  An excessively nasty trial judge forbids
                  them from arguing self-defense or defense of third parties because
                  a videotape clearly shows the defendant walking up to and shooting
                  the dealer who wasn't threatening anyone at the time.  The defendant
                  herself forbids them from arguing that she was insane, because
                  she knew just what she was doing.  She killed the dealer because
                  he had ruined the lives of many adults and children and the police
                  did nothing to stop him (aside from putting up a video camera
                  that films the murder).  Thus Jimmy and Eugene have to hope for
                  &quot;jury nullification,&quot; another argument that the trial
                  judge will not allow.  In his argument to the jury, Jimmy emphasizes
                  his client's plight and, to avoid the judge's wrath, repeatedly
                  tells the jurors that he can't tell them to nullify an unjust
                  law.  His hope is that the jurors will realize that he wants
                  them to do just that, and of course they do.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The jury nullification argument
                  is an interesting and important theme. Jury nullification has
                  a long and checkered history in the U.S.   John Adams asked a
                  colonial jury to nullify British sedition laws in the trial of
                  John Peter Zenger.  This helped establish freedom of the press
                  in the colonies.  On the other hand, Southern white juries also
                  practiced nullification in refusing to convict whites who had
                  lynched blacks.  Today, jury nullification is suspect.  Lawyers
                  are not permitted to argue it.  Jurors who suggest it in the
                  jury room are in danger of being bounced off the jury for having
                  violated their oath to follow the law.  But jury nullification
                  still happens in juries all across the land.  And defenders of
                  the jury system often mention jury nullification as a reason
                  for keeping this antique institution.  Jimmy's closing argument-archly
                  telling the jury that he couldn't urge them to acquit his client
                  because she had killed a monster to protect her neighbors-was
                  a clever way to clue the jury in to the possibility that they
                  had an absolute right to acquit the defendant.  But despite Jimmy's
                  rhetorical, B'rer Rabbit-like craftiness, his argument clearly
                  invites the jurors to nullify the law.  The judge would have
                  had valid grounds to cite him for contempt and perhaps refer
                  the case to the State Bar's disciplinary authority.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Meanwhile, Alan Shore ends
                  up in front of an equally humorless, almost as nasty trial judge.
                   Like Jimmy and Eugene, Shore lacks a legal defense to the battery
                  charge.  However, his client too has a strong moral defense.
                   The businesswoman not only refused his request for alms, but
                  also called him nasty names in front of his young daughter. 
                  Since she had embarrassed him, he decided to embarrass her by
                  walking into her office and kissing her.  Perhaps to avoid two
                  jury nullification arguments in the same show, Shore talks the
                  businesswoman into dropping the charges.  Rather fortuitously
                  and unbelievably, the vagrant lived in a flop house and had an
                  insurance policy that could pay out $10,000 to a victim of &quot;defamation.&quot;
                   Shore just happens to know the claims adjuster, who will look
                  the other way when agreeing that the vagrant's actions constitute
                  defamation and pay the woman $10,000.  Thus Shore is really practicing
                  insurance fraud-and is called on it by the firm's new paralegal.
                   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Shore is ethically challenged
                  and he also seems to be addicted to sexually harassing the law
                  firm staff and any other females in sight.  It seems unlikely
                  that the firm-even given its present economic struggles-would
                  hire somebody who had just been kicked out of his law firm for
                  embezzling.   It would have been more interesting if he had left
                  the former firm because the clients were rich slime only to discover
                  that the clients of his new firm were poor slime.  Alan Shore's
                  character should prove interesting as David Kelley further develops
                  it.   <br>
