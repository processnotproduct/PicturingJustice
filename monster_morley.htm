                  The victimization of a serial killer in <i>Monster</i></font></b><font size="-1" face="Verdana"></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Kristen Morley</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Prior to seeing the film <i>Monster</i>,
                  I knew very little about the film.  After watching <i>Monster</i>,
                  I found it difficult to forget.  <i>Monster</i> is based upon
                  the true story of Aileen Wournos, a highway hooker and America's
                  first female serial-killer, who was put to death in 1992 for
                  murdering seven men.  Aileen's killing spree began when she shot
                  and killed a John after being brutally raped.  The sense of empowerment
                  she derived from killing the John who raped her, and a desperate
                  desire to provide for her girlfriend Shelby, drove Aileen to
                  kill 6 more victims before she was apprehended by police.   </font></p>

                  <p><img src="images/monster.jpg" width="117" height="150" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Initially,
                  I attributed the title of the movie <i>Monster</i> as referring
                  to Aileen Wournos.  She was a serial killer who took the lives
                  of seven men, how could she be anything but a monster?  However,
                  by the end of the movie, I could not identify Aileen with that
                  label. Aileen Wournos is portrayed as a very sorrowful character.
                   Rather, it was the Johns who took advantage of Aileen and the
                  men who had victimized her all her life that became the monster
                  to me.  When Aileen killed them, I felt &quot;schadenfreude&quot;:
                  a degree of satisfaction in their deaths.  Recognizing my own
                  reaction to this movie caused me to question my values: had I
                  simply been manipulated by the movie's sympathetic portrayal
                  of Aileen Wournos, or do I really believe that sexual victimization
                  justifies murder?  </font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Monster</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> fills in some of the gaps left by
                  the movie <i>Dead Man Walking</i>.  Critics of <i>Dead Man Walking</i>
                  thought the film lacked social consciousness by failing to show
                  the disadvantaged background of most inmates on death row.  Those
                  who have worked with death row inmates attest to the impact that
                  childhood physical and emotional abuse has in creating a criminal.
                   Through the characterization of Aileen Wournos, <i>Monster</i>
                  subtly and effectively reveals how Aileen's childhood abuse contributed
                  to her criminalization.  Aileen's life is a tale of abuse and
                  abandonment.  At age 8 she was repeatedly sexually abused by
                  her father's friend, and when her father found out, he beat her.
                   She gave up a baby for adoption at age 13.  By the time she
                  was a teenager, she was homeless and forced to become a hooker
                  to survive.  Where the movie picks up her life, Aileen is 28-years-old
                  and contemplating suicide.  As a viewer, it is difficult not
                  to assess her later actions in the context of her personal history.
                   The magnitude of abuse she had suffered inspired in me a righteous
                  anger at those who contributed to the victimization, and the
                  social system that allowed it to happen.           </font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Monster</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> can be characterized as a revenge
                  film.  As defined by William Miller in his article <i>Clint Eastwood
                  and Equity: Popular Culture's Theory of Revenge</i>, a revenge
                  narrative, &quot;takes us from indignation and outrage at a wrong,
                  via fear and loathing of the wrongdoer, to a sense of satisfaction
                  of having righted on the body of the wrongdoer.&quot;   The initial
                  wrong perceived in <i>Monster</i> that inspires our fear and
                  outrage is the rape of Aileen.  When she kills the John, we feel
                  satisfaction that he got what he deserved.  However, the later
                  murders committed by Aileen were not in response to the same
                  circumstances that occurred in the first instance.  Whereas the
                  first murder could be construed as self-defence, the later murders
                  were much more predatory.  With the exception of her final victim,
                  Aileen killed Johns simply because they were Johns.  Yet, her
                  murders still find some legitimacy under the revenge model. 
                  Even though she is not directly under attack, she is still the
                  victim of men degrading her for sexual gratification.  Rather
                  than fighting against one specific instance of rape, she is fighting
                  against a society that has allowed her to suffer a lifetime of
                  sexual victimization.  The wrong that inspires the revenge is
                  still there, but the dimension that changes in the subsequent
                  murders is the audience's lack of fear and loathing of the Johns.
                   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Miller posits that the audience
                  acts as the judge in determining when an avenger crosses the
                  line and becomes a villain.  The legitimacy of an avenger is
                  dependant upon whether their response is proportional to the
                  wrong committed.  A case can be made that after committing the
                  first murder, Aileen became a villain rather than an avenger,
                  particularly as her victims became less culpable.  It may be
                  legitimate to fear and loath a rapist and feel some satisfaction
                  in his death, yet it is difficult to argue that a man who visits
                  a prostitute because his wife is in a wheelchair should be killed
                  for his indiscretions.  Aileen's final victim was a kindly older
                  man who picked her up not realizing she was a prostitute.  Upon
                  seeing that she was in a desperate state, he offered her money
                  and a place to stay with him and his wife.  Aileen did not want
                  to kill him, and was visibly distraught as she agonized over
                  what to do.  However, in the end, she did kill him, afraid that
                  if she didn't he would blow her cover.  With this murder, that
                  had no legitimacy or revenge motive, Aileen seemed to have firmly
                  crossed the line from avenger to villain.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Although the audience may not
                  find objective legitimacy for Aileen's actions, she strived psychologically
                  to legitimate her own actions.  During her killing spree, Aileen
                  tried to justify her actions by casting all her potential victims
                  as violent abusers.  In light of her history of being exploited
                  by men, it is plausible to believe that in her mind all men were
                  in fact violent abusers.  In one instance, Aileen attempted to
                  vilify a John she was planning to murder, only to find he was
                  painfully shy with a stuttering problem and had never picked
                  up a hooker before.  This discovery gave her pause and she did
                  not kill him.  This shows that Aileen does not fit the mould
                  of a typical serial killer: she is not killing indiscriminately
                  but rather acting out against the very class of people who had
                  victimized her.  Perhaps it is because Aileen herself is a victim
                  that it is difficult to characterize her wholly as a villain.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Aileen Wournos is a character
                  for whom I felt an immense amount of sympathy.  This sympathy
                  was based not only on Aileen's sexual victimization, but also
                  on the corresponding betrayal she suffered from everyone in the
                  movie who could have been in a position to &quot;save&quot; her.
                   Authority figures not only failed to protect her, but contributed
                  to her victimization.  As a child, Aileen's father punished her
                  for being the object of molestation.  As an adult, Aileen was
                  twice picked up by a police officer and forced to perform oral
                  sex on him.  Aileen's efforts to rehabilitate herself were frustrated
                  by lack of support.   After being raped by the John, Aileen wanted
                  to stop hooking and tried to secure a legitimate job.  She was
                  humiliated and rejected at every place she applied, and ultimately
                  returned to hooking, partially motivated by a desire to provide
                  for Shelby.  Even Shelby betrays Aileen out of self-interest.
                    In the final scenes of the movie, Shelby testifies against
                  Aileen at her criminal trial, as part of a plea to exculpate
                  her own knowledge of and complicity in the murders.  At the end
                  of the movie, I almost felt more animosity towards Shelby than
                  I did toward Aileen: a completely inappropriate response given
                  the relative weight of their crimes.      </font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Monster</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> ends with Aileen being lead away from
                  the courtroom and a post-script informs the audience that she
                  was executed after spending 12 years on death row.  Though Aileen's
                  execution was off-screen, I was left with the feeling that it
                  was unjust for her to be put to death.  My reaction to <i>Monster</i>
                  stands in direct contrast to my reaction to <i>Dead Man Walking</i>.
                   At the end of <i>Dead Man Walking</i> I felt that justice was
                  served by putting Mathew Ponselet to death.  My reaction was
                  certainly not premised upon the relative severity of their crimes:
                  Ponselet being guilty of an isolated incident of rape and murder,
                  and Aileen being guilty of seven murders over a period of time.
                  Objectively, Aileen is more deserving of the death penalty. 
                  However there are two striking differences that effect my assessment
                  of the culpability of these two characters.  First, Aileen was
                  not just the perpetrator of crimes, she was very much a victim
                  herself and had been victimized her entire life.  Her crimes
                  were not random; rather, they were the direct result of acting
                  out against the emotional abuse she had suffered through her
                  own victimization.  Second, Aileen was a victim of sexual exploitation
                  and degradation, whereas Ponselet was the perpetrator of these
                  crimes.  Though I am arguable displaying a gender bias in this
                  assessment, I have a disproportionate amount of sympathy for
                  victims of sexual exploitation and a disproportionate level of
                  condemnation for sexual aggressors.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The story of Aileen Wornous
                  is a tragedy.  She was a victim, turned victimizer.  At the end
                  of Monster, I felt an injustice had been committed.  There is
                  more than one monster in this film, yet Aileen Wornous was the
                  only one held accountable for her crimes.  A society that allows
                  women to be sexually victimized is also monstrous and this is
                  the monster that should be put to death.<br>
