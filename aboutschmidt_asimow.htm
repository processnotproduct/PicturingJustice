                  THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">About Schmidt</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is a good movie, and Jack Nicholson
                  and Kathy Bates do a great job, but . . .</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">You know where it says in the
                  credits &quot;based on the book by Louis Begley&quot;? Well,
                  fuhgeddabout it. There is virtually nothing in common between
                  the novel and the movie. And the result is a huge lost opportunity.
                  This could have been a really great movie about the soul of a
                  lawyer.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/aboutschmidt.jpg" width="168" height="112" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The
                  only things that the book and movie have in common is that both
                  are about retired widowers who don't know what to do with themselves;
                  both hate their prospective sons-in-law; both have ambiguous
                  relationships with the mothers of their sons-in-law to be. The
                  screenwriter kept the title to the book and dumped everything
                  else. Now, this isn't unheard of--filmmakers have sometimes bought
                  book titles and ditched the contents. Why they would do that
                  here isn't clear--the book was not a best seller and the title
                  isn't going to bring many people into the theater because they
                  have fond memories of the book. But the result of this cavalier
                  disregard of the book's contents is tragic, because the book
                  was so good and could have been so cinematic.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There is nothing significant
                  in common between book and movie. The book is set in New York
                  and concerns a wealthy retired Wall St. lawyer named Schmidt
                  who is anything but a nebbish. The film involves a shallow, basically
                  boring, retired insurance guy in Omaha named Schmidt. The son-in-law
                  in the book (Jon Riker) is a young lawyer at Schmidt's old firm
                  whom Schmidt had mentored. The son-in-law in the book (Randall)
                  is a loser who sells water beds. The reason Schmidt hates Riker
                  in the book is anti-Semitism--he is Jewish and Schmidt's daughter
                  is planning to convert. Schmidt finds that utterly unbearable.
                  In the movie, Randall and his family, are firmly working class;
                  Schmidt hates him and the family because of class bias. In the
                  book, the secular Jewish Riker family is just as upper class
                  as Schmidt; Jon Riker's mother is a brilliant psychotherapist
                  who might be seducing Schmidt. In the movie, Randall's mother
                  Roberta is some sort of new age guru who discusses her orgasms
                  and is definitely seducing Schmidt.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the book, there is no road
                  trip, no Winnebago, and no Tanzanian orphan (Personally I found
                  the letters from Schmidt to the orphan off--putting--I always
                  thought it is considered weak screen writing to rely on voice-overs
                  in which the character tells you how he feels.)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Instead, the book involves
                  a beautifully nuanced portrait of a Wall St. lawyer whose firm
                  has forced him out because his method of practice is old fashioned
                  and he doesn't make any rain. Then they screw him on the retirement
                  plan. The book is about lawyers, and law firms, which is unsurprising
                  since author Begley is a senior partner specializing in international
                  law at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton and knows whereof he speaks.
                  When I heard the book was being made into a film, I was thrilled
                  because the book delves so deeply into Schmidt's soul. Although
                  involuntarily retired, Schmidt is a lawyer, through and through,
                  in the way he look at the world and handles relationships with
                  friends, former colleagues, and his family.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In my opinion (and I'm not
                  alone here), the best lawyer movie of all time is <i>Counsellor
                  at Law</i> (1933), directed at breakneck speed by William Wyler
                  and starring John Barrymore. The great news is that this classic
                  has just become available on VHS and DVD. If you haven't seen
                  it, do so immediately. Not a bit dated, it's about an up-from-the
                  gutter New York Jew (George Simon) who has a silk-stocking NY
                  practice but is constantly being dragged back into the lower
                  east side. The entire film is set in Simon's gorgeous art deco
                  office. We see an astounding variety of clients, relatives, staff
                  members, legal problems, personal problems, ethical problems.
                  We see lots of brutal anti-Semitism as well as class bias. Most
                  of all, we gaze into the soul of a great lawyer. <i>About Schmidt</i>
                  could have been--should have been--an updated <i>Counsellor at
                  Law</i>. Nicholson would have been great in the part--he could
                  have peeled away the layers of onion, disclosing how a lifelong
                  lawyer to the bone (anti-Semitic warts and all) copes with retirement,
                  personal crises, and family disintegration. But no.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">And why in the world did they
                  drop the anti-Semitism theme? This could have been one of the
                  best movies ever on that subject--as good as <i>Gentlemen's Agreement</i>.
                  Did the filmmakers feel the audience couldn't accept a protagonist
                  who was anti-Semitic? Is this political correctness in action?
                  We might as well head back into the world of the Hays Code if
                  filmmakers self-censor themselves away from grappling with sensitive
                  subjects.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the book , Schmidt is redeemed
                  by a romance with Carrie, a 24-year old Hispanic waitress who
                  is able to give him what he really needs--great sex, of course,
                  but also a soul mate who really understands him. (The affair
                  with Carrie is carried forward in Begley's sequel <i>Schmidt
                  Delivered</i>). Needless to say, Schmidt's relationship with
                  Carrie drives his snooty daughter absolutely berserk. Schmidt's
                  breach of the generational barrier (not to mention the class
                  and ethnicity barriers) made the book really absorbing and downright
                  uplifting. The movie ends with&#133;. a letter from a nun in
                  Africa suggesting that Schmidt is redeemed because he sends $22
                  a month to a Tanzanian orphan. Thud. Which ending do you find
                  more compelling in human terms?</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">About Schmidt</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> could have been <i>Counsellor at Law</i>
                  for the new millennium. Instead it was a pretty forgettable vehicle
                  for stars Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates to strut their stuff.
                  What a waste. <br>
