                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The film <i>A Man for All Seasons</i>
                  is a cinematic tour de force.  Directed by the legendary Fred
                  Zinnemann (<i>High Noon</i>) and starring such exemplary actors
                  as Paul Scofield, Orson Welles, and John Hurt it won six academy
                  awards in 1966.  The film uses the historical story of Sir Thomas
                  More to explore one of Zinnemann's favorite themes, that of a
                  person standing up for their personal convictions.  However,
                  the film also wrestles with several themes that deal with legal
                  issues such as how to deal with conscientious objectors, natural
                  versus positive law, consequentialism versus deontology and the
                  history of legal safeguards in the Common Law tradition.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/manallseasons.jpg" width="109" height="154" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The
                  character of Sir Thomas More (who sat on the Kings Council and
                  eventually became Lord Chancellor) is a jurist who is devoted
                  to the laws and sovereign of England.  He performs his duties
                  diligently, turning down numerous attempts at bribery and ruling
                  with a learned justice.  He is a personal friend of the King.
                   However, he is also a devout Catholic Christian.  When the King
                  seeks a divorce from his barren wife so that he can wed his mistress
                  and is rebuffed by the Church, he declares himself the head of
                  the Church and puts pressure on the clergy to accept his divorce
                  and new wife.  More's conscience does not allow him to approve.
                    He resigns his post as Lord Chancellor in protest.  Parliament,
                  at the urging of the King, passes a law requiring subjects to
                  swear an oath that the King's marriage (and any future heirs
                  from that marriage) is legitimate.  For religious reasons More
                  refuses to sign the oath and is consequently jailed and prosecuted
                  for treason.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">More's refusal to sign the
                  oath brings up the difference between civil disobedience and
                  conscientious objection as drawn by John Rawls. Civil disobedience
                  for Rawls is a form of debate, a non-violent action aimed at
                  the public and guided by political principles.  Change is the
                  central point.  Rawls differentiates this from conscientious
                  objection, which is the non-compliance with laws one sees as
                  immoral.  Conscientious objection is not meant to change the
                  political sphere; it is just a decision to risk punishment rather
                  than violate one's moral principles.  The character of More certainly
                  falls into the category of conscientious objector.  He does not
                  use his position to rail against the King's oath; he does not
                  counsel others on the immorality of the oath itself (though certainly
                  this is in part to defend himself through silence).  Instead,
                  he refers to himself as a loyal subject to the King who simply
                  will not swear to the oath (he does not even say that by not
                  swearing we should read into his silence disapproval of the oath).
                   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Rawls defends civil disobedience
                  by stating that it acts as a vigilant police on the laws of society,
                  constantly forcing us to examine our laws and measure them by
                  the yardstick of justice.  Conscientious objection on the other
                  hand is a personal issue; it is only morally permissible if the
                  harm caused by non-compliance is outweighed by the correctness
                  of the personal principle invoked in conscientious objection.
                   What is the harm that More's refusal could possibly cause? 
                  The movie actually hints at such harm when at the beginning Cardinal
                  Woolsey defends his 'flexibility' on Church law in granting the
                  King a divorce by pointing to the possible civil strife that
                  could follow an heir-less sovereign.  In this context, More's
                  refusal could be a morally impermissible act.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This actually brings up two
                  of the other issues of legal philosophy thrust upon us by the
                  film.  More's refusal to take the oath despite the consequences
                  to himself, his family, and his realm constitute a form of deontological
                  ethics.  According to deontology, some acts are inherently immoral
                  despite the consequences that follow.  Thus, the philosopher
                  Immanuel Kant in his famed categorical imperative stated that
                  it was wrong to tell a lie, even in the case of whether one should
                  lie to a murderer who was stalking his victim hidden in the nearby
                  closet.  Cardinal Woolsey represents another view, that of the
                  consequentialist.  He admonishes More to 'come down to earth'
                  when More refused to change his position even when warned of
                  the strife that could follow his defiance.  In a similar vein,
                  Karl Marx admonished those who clung to an abstract and 'neutral'
                  rule of law that had negative consequences on the poor and oppressed.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Mores refusal also invokes
                  the debate between positive and natural law.  When his soon to
                  be son-in-law, a political radical, argues the law must be made
                  malleable to the interests of justice, More launches into a long
                  defense of the importance of 'man's laws.' He states that they
                  are all that exist to protect citizens of his realm, and that
                  when they are swept away to ensure 'justice'  then all would
                  stand unprotected (the actual metaphor used is whether the law
                  should apply to the Devil, in other words one who we know is
                  evil and thus should have no protection of positive law).  More's
                  speech invokes the theorists of positive law such as John Austin
                  who maintained that man made law, the order of the sovereign,
                  is all the law there is.  Ironically, it is More who is later
                  caught up in the very positive law he defended and in response,
                  he speaks of his duty to his soul.  This appeal to God's laws
                  invokes the perpetual counter-argument of natural law theorists
                  who hold that positive law can and should be measured by a 'higher'
                  Law of Nature.  The King's law has the power to execute More,
                  but does it have the authority?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">One of the last striking things
                  about this film may be a much-overlooked feature.  Many viewers
                  of the film will likely pessimistically comment on the trumped
                  up nature of the prosecution of More played out brilliantly at
                  the end of the film.  However, such pessimism may be unwarranted.
                   More's knowledge of the law enables him to conduct a legal strategy
                  based on the precedent that silence on an issue does not necessarily
                  imply disapproval of the Kings position (which would then warrant
                  High Treason).  In his trial More is given a jury (though one
                  surely bullied by the Crown, as in the scene where the prosecutor
                  declares that surely no break for jury deliberations is necessary
                  and so the verdict is immediately rendered), an account of the
                  charges against him, and the right to defend himself (including
                  cross examination of witnesses).  It is only because of the distortion
                  of evidence (the implication that More took a bribe that he clearly
                  did not) and the testimony of a false witness that More is ultimately
                  convicted.  The question of course remains, does this show the
                  advanced state of English rights of the accused at this ancient
                  state, or does it point to the more unsettling conclusion that
                  even abstract legal safeguards cannot protect one when prosecutorial
                  dishonesty rears its ugly head?<br>
