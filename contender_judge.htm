                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There are several themes illustrated
                  in <i>The Contender</i>.   This film utilizes the process of
                  selecting political leaders as a vehicle through which we consider
                  topics such as sexism and the right of privacy.   </font></p>

                  <p><img src="images/contender.jpg" width="218" height="144" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Laine
                  Hanson may very well be the first woman to hold the office of
                  Vice President of the United States.  Three weeks have passed
                  since the vice president's death and the president is anxious
                  to name a successor.   His designate is Senator Laine Hanson,
                  the gentle lady from Ohio.  Before she can assume office, however,
                  Senator Hanson must participate in a confirmation hearing administered
                  by the House of Representatives.  The hearing will assist the
                  House in deciding whether to reject or consent to her nomination.
                   Herein lies Senator Hanson's nemesis, Senator Shelly Runyon,
                  Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Senator Runyon has
                  another candidate in mind for the vice presidency.  For this
                  reason, he will do whatever it takes to ensure enough votes against
                  Senator Hanson.  In order to discredit and humiliate her, Senator
                  Runyon leaks information about an alleged sexual encounter Senator
                  Hanson had in college.   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The focus of this film is the
                  inquest Senator Hanson undergoes as part of the confirmation
                  process.  The senator feels that she is being subjected to a
                  higher level of scrutiny because she is a woman.   In actuality,
                  her gender is both an asset and a liability.  The president makes
                  no secret of the fact that putting a woman in office means a
                  great deal to him.  He believes in the concept of making the
                  American dream blind to gender and wants to crystallize this
                  belief by choosing a female vice president. <br>
                    <br>
                  The film blatantly illustrates an instance in which she is subjected
                  to a double standard because she is female.  Upon her nomination,
                  Senator Hanson's husband is advised that he should stay behind
                  the scenes during the confirmation period.  It is explained that
                  although a wife seen behind her husband is viewed as supportive,
                  a husband in the same position is viewed as a puppeteer.  This
                  conveys the notion that it is acceptable for a woman to be seen
                  supporting her husband, but she is not worthy of similar public
                  encouragement.  On the surface this sentiment imparts a since
                  of shame upon men, but what it really does is cast a disparaging
                  light on women.  It sends a message that it is all right for
                  a woman to &quot;stand by her man,&quot; but she is not entitled
                  to reciprocal treatment, at least not in public. Casting a negative
                  reflection on men cleverly accomplishes this objective.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the senator's opinion, her
                  gender has precipitated the inquiry about a sexual encounter
                  that supposedly occurred when she was nineteen years old.  She
                  states, &quot;If I were a man nobody would care how many sexual
                  partners I had in college. If it's not relevant for a man, it's
                  not relevant for a woman.&quot;   Senator Hanson is described
                  as a cancer of virtuous decay because of an incident that purportedly
                  occurred more then twenty-five years ago.   Questions that must
                  be raised at this juncture are: Why is this incident so critical
                  to the confirmation process?  Is a virtuous candidate more trustworthy
                  and reliable than one who is not? By whose standard should one
                  be characterized as virtuous?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The very mention of the past
                  of a candidate or political appointee raises the issue of the
                  right of privacy.  Must the public know if a candidate committed
                  adultery or had children out of wedlock in order to determine
                  if the candidate is fit for office?  Should moral character be
                  one of the barometers upon which we elect our public officials?
                   Of course we want politicians to possess a since of morality.
                   Because they are entrusted with such tremendous amounts of authority,
                  we want politicians to be honest and forthright.   At what point.
                  however, does our investigation of them move beyond seeking to
                  appoint an honorable person and become a witch-hunt? </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The measure of an individual's
                  capability for assuming office should be based on the individual's
                  opinions, philosophies and political track record.  However,
                  this is not always the case.   The lives of public figures, both
                  past and present, are placed under a magnifying glass for the
                  entire world to examine.  The confirmation hearing of Clarence
                  Thomas exemplified this fact.  Additionally, it is common knowledge
                  that the awareness of marital infidelities can cost candidates
                  elections.  Remember Gary Hart?  Yet in contrast, the Monica
                  Lewinsky affair didn't seem to hurt President Clinton's standing
                  with the public even after his impeachment.  President Clinton's
                  situation evidences the fact that public sentiment can go either
                  way.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In refusing to address any
                  questions based on her past sexual conduct, Senator Hanson makes
                  an important statement.  Her position indicates that these types
                  of personal questions have no place in the political arena and
                  therefore she will not address them to either confirm or deny
                  their accuracy.  She states, &quot;I cannot respond to the committee's
                  lightly veiled accusations because to do so would imply that
                  it was all right for them to be made.&quot; Imagine what would
                  happen if all those with political aspirations responded like
                  the senator. </font></p>
