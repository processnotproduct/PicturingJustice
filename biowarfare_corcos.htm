                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Christine A. Corcos</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The recent outbreaks of anthrax
                  infection and exposure, and the current lively discussion over
                  wholesale smallpox vaccination, whether or not they are linked
                  to the  events of September 11, 2001 are both horrific and strangely
                  reminiscent of some of the kinds of biological screen destruction
                  that Hollywood has imagined for us over the past fifty years.
                   Television brought us scenes of New York City and the Pentagon,
                  and the crash in Pennsylvania that seemed both unbelievable and
                  eerily familiar, life imitating art, partly because we are used
                  to seeing (imaginary) scenes of destruction on the screen. The
                  continuing media coverage of the hour by hour investigation of
                  attempts to terrorize us recreate for us the real-time anguish
                  of watching friends or loved ones undergo injury or illness.
                  It also recalls for us the frightening stories we are familiar
                  with from many movies. It follows a familiar pattern: the revelation
                  or speculation that weapons of mass destruction exist, that a
                  national enemy is deliberately manufacturing and stockpiling
                  them, and that it plans to use them against us.  We see public
                  health officials and law enforcement (including the military)
                  go into action, often fighting over turf and the proper procedures.
                  We see the press (usually personified by an aggressive reporter)
                  announcing information dramatically, bit by bit, seeming to want
                  to inflame the public. The films familiarize us with certain
                  health protocols, to the extent that we are now hearing real-life
                  victims of the attacks criticize the CDC and others in authority
                  for failing to act quickly enough, that is, with the kind of
                  organized, mass approach that we see in films such as <i>The
                  Andromeda Strain</i>. Indeed, we recognize the fellows in the

                  HazMat suits from television; in their elaborate white costumes
                  they seem quite unreal and quite inhuman.<br>
<br>
                  The enemy may be from outer space, as in films such as <i>War
                  of the Worlds</i> (1953 and remakes) or <i>Independence Day</i>
                  (1996). It may be the result of human-made experimentation that
                  results in accidental escape into the environment or intentional
                  destruction, as in <i>Night of the Lepus</i> (1972), creating
                  not viral plagues but plagues of mutated animals or insects.
                  It may result from outer space contamination of the atmosphere,
                  as in <i>The Andromeda Strain</i> (1971). Or it may, as in some
                  of the scenarios created for us by media commentators and government
                  officials, be the result of malicious tampering, either by a
                  foreign power or by disaffected individuals among us. In every
                  case, however, Hollywood presents us both with an imminent biological
                  or chemical threat and speculates about the ability of the government
                  to deal with the public health and law enforcement crises that
                  result.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/panic.jpg" width="122" height="218" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Coordination between public health
                  officials and various police forces is the aim, but Hollywood
                  often portrays it as an uneasy alliance.  The scientists and
                  physician heroes are presumably interested in the preservation
                  of life and prevention of harm. Law enforcement and security
                  forces aim to contain the harm and bring the perpetrators to
                  justice.  As far back as 1950 the classic <i>Panic in the Streets</i>,
                  set in New Orleans,  features an Army physician (Richard Widmark)
                  as the hero; in tandem with a local police officer he tracks
                  down a killer suffering from bubonic plague. His first mission
                  is to locate the sick man; unlike the police he is not necessarily
                  interested in bringing him to justice. He and the police officer
                  work well together, however, sending the message that all government
                  workers have the welfare of the public at heart. Although the
                  title of the film implies that the city's residents are suffering
                  from mass hysteria, the movie actually demonstrates how public
                  health officials endeavor to promote calm and explain the procedures
                  necessary to protect the citizenry's health. The movie was remade
                  in 1973 as <i>Killer By Night</i> (also called <i>The City By
                  Night</i>).  The physician hero has become  a civilian, the plague
                  is diphtheria, the sick man is a cop killer, and the doctor has
                  a more difficult time convincing the police officer that public
                  health is the first priority.  Much of the film, as the title
                  suggests, takes place at night, unlike <i>Panic in the Streets</i>,
                  which is characterized by daylight scenes. The changes in attitude
                  and ambience track the anti-government, anti-police notions of
                  the period.<br>
<br>
                  Preventing the plague, accidental or intentional, that biological
                  weapons could cause is the theme of many films and television
                  episodes. That prevention almost always takes the form of covert
                  action on the part of U. S. national security organizations,
                  as in <i>Avalanche Express</i> (1979).  American operatives try
                  to facilitate the escape of a Soviet general with information
                  about the USSR's biological weapons program.  The possibility
                  that a foreign government is stockpiling weapons of mass destruction
                  and may plan to use them against the U.S. is often dramatized.
                  Indeed, the short lived television series <i>The Burning Zone</i>
                  (UPN 1996-1997) postulated a top secret group of biologists whose
                  sole mission is to track down and prevent the human race's destruction
                  by a group known as &quot;The Dawn.&quot; Obviously, regular
                  law enforcement is powerless to save us from this threat. The
                  unintended consequences theme is obvious in films such as <i>Deep
                  Space</i> (1987) in which an American satellite armed with a
                  biological weapon crashes to earth, accidentally letting the
                  weapon loose among the unsuspecting populace. Again, the local
                  police must deal with the problem. <br>
<br>
                  This kind of official failure is the theme of George Romero's
                  <i>The Crazies</i> (1973) in which a Pennsylvania town suffers
                  the fallout from biological weapons. The Army is unable to contain
                  the threat.  Interestingly, the &quot;biological/chemical weapons
                  accident&quot; is sometimes used to prevent the public from discovering
                  threats of a different kind, as in the <i>X-Files</i> episode
                  <i>Fallen Angel</i>.  We are so well conditioned to understand
                  that such weapons might accidentally be let loose and that the
                  military might have to prohibit our access to the affected area
                  that, the show suggests, we willingly accept such stories as
                  an explanation (or cover story) for events that are far more
                  sinister. Biological/chemical accidents are no longer something
                  unusual and frightening; they are almost expected. The problem
                  with the military's final report on Roswell (&quot;really, this
                  is the last time we will come up with an explanation for this,
                  this really is what happened, unlike the last four times we gave
                  you an explanation&quot;) is not that it didn't make sense, but
                  that television and the movies have already convinced us that
                  biological and chemical accidents (or military experiments gone
                  horribly wrong) are regularly the cover-up for truths that our
                  government doesn't want us to know. Interestingly, physicians
                  and other health care workers are not automatically swallowing
                  the government's demand that they provide smallpox and other
                  inoculations for the general population. They have legitimate
                  health care concerns about the dangers of smallpox vaccines.
                  Will the rest of us begin, perhaps at the urging of the creative
                  media, to consider other, more sinister reasons for such opposition?
<br>
<br>
                  Biological weapons in the hands of a foreign government, albeit
                  an unfriendly one, is one thing. Foreign governments can and
                  do react to political and military pressure. But biological weapons
                  in the hands of terrorists is quite another, and it is the theme
                  of films like  <i>The Berlin Conspiracy</i> (1992), in which
                  such weapons fall into the hands of terrorists. The threat to
                  all governments forces the Western allies and the former Eastern
                  Bloc to cooperate to prevent the sale of these weapons on the
                  black market. This kind of fictional  cooperation expresses the
                  humanitarian hope that humans, whatever their political differences,
                  will work together if the threat is great enough, and is to the
                  human race as a whole.  But it is usually portrayed at the individual
                  level, demonstrating how human beings can learn to get along
                  if they get to know each other.  It rarely shows governments
                  working together and overcoming turf wars and national security
                  fears.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/bodysnatchers.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In the science fiction
                  series <i>Crusade</i> (TNT/Warner Brothers, 1999), a followup
                  series to <i>Babylon 5</i>, the military and the scientific establishment
                  are engaged in trying to find a cure for a plague that aliens
                  have loosed on the universe, after the military has failed to
                  forestall the activities of followers of its alien enemies. Other
                  post-apocalyptic films, in which biological weapons rather than
                  nuclear ones have destroyed society and law include <i>The Terror
                  Within</i> (1988). In movies such as <i>War of the Worlds</i>
                  or <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>, the alien beings themselves
                  stand in for the biological infestation that will kill all human
                  life. In <i>War of the Worlds</i>, the military is powerless
                  to protect us against the threat. Only the happenstance of Terran
                  biology destroys the invaders. In the original <i>Invasion of
                  the Body Snatchers</i> (1956), the physician (psychiatrist) who
                  should protect his patients from the threat actually becomes
                  one of the invaders. Those few humans who know the truth convince
                  the authorities of the danger too late to save their friends.
                  Even in such films as <i>The Thing</i> (1951) the original film
                  with James Arness (who also starred in <i>Them!</i> a 1954 film
                  about mutant ants) the danger from the alien being becomes a
                  danger from within as the being takes over the bodies of various
                  individuals in the story. The biological 5th Column theme appears
                  not only in the remakes of <i>The Thing</i>  but also in television
                  episodes inspired by the story such as the <i>X_Files</i>  (&quot;Ice&quot;).<br>
<br>
                  This lag between the identification of a potential threat and
                  comprehension of its magnitude gives rise to a great deal of
                  the terror that such attacks cause. If the police or military
                  fail to protect us from physical invaders we can still buy weapons
                  and mount a defense If a public entity, such as the CDC, fails
                  to react appropriately or quickly enough, we are powerless. Even
                  without conspiracy theories as an explanation, we are so conditioned
                  to believe in the incompetence of government officials and the
                  insensitivity and ignorance of bureaucrats that we question whether
                  we need to start manufacturing Cipro in our basements.  Further,
                  our lack of medical knowledge leaves us at the mercy of health
                  workers at the very time that the government and the media ask
                  us to wonder about their motives and their commitments to us.
<br>
                   <br>
                  In some cases, of course, the scientist is the evil doer, and
                  because of our national committment to individual freedoms, the
                  police can step in only after a crime has been committed and
                  death or injury occurs. The ebola virus, first described to us
                  in books such as Richard Preston's <i>The Hot Zone</i>,  becomes
                  the plague of choice in Airboss II: <i>Preemptive Strike</i>
                  (1998) and <i>Virus</i> (1995); in both films the protagonist
                  discovers a plot on the part of the government and other officials
                  either to spread the virus or to prevent treatment.  Conspiracy
                  runs rampant in these films, so that while we have not yet heard
                  suggestions that the anthrax outbreak is the work of some government
                  agency, we are hearing criticisms from certain sectors that some
                  affected segments of the population, most notably Congress, are
                  getting better medical care than others. The suggestion that
                  those in charge care more about their own class than about the
                  general population strikes at the very heart of the notion of
                  American democracy. It is exactly the kind of class warfare that
                  feeds on panic caused by national disaster.  And, given the common
                  film images of corruption among government bureaucrats, we should
                  expect to hear more of it.<br>
<br>
                  Television and movies have set the standard very high for officials
                  attempting to deal with the current biological threat. We are
                  so familiar with the legal and medical procedures that we believe
                  are routine that we watch with a critical eye to see if they
                  are followed. The cautious statements of real life officials
                  seem to hide sinister truths; we sense they must know more than
                  they are divulging, because we've seen in the movies that the
                  government always covers up the truth in an attempt to control
                  the public. Our familiarity with a real biological attack comes
                  from the many fictional ones we have seen on the screen. We know
                  how things should be; the government should have contained the
                  problem by now, or some heroic journalist should have given us
                  the truth so that we can defend ourselves. That they have not
                  demonstrates the extent to which life does not imitate art and
                  adds to the uncertainty and terror of our times.<br>
