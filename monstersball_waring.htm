                  This film examines whether redemption and forgiveness are possible
                  in some circumstances. It presents two characters guilty of abhorrent
                  behavior and shows the different outcomes they experience. The
                  two characters' stories are interwoven beautifully on the screen;
                  some of the editing and scene transitions are alone worth the
                  price of admission. The film also suggests that great sex can
                  assist in the redemption of lost souls. (This commentary reveals
                  key plot details that may spoil the film if you have yet to see
                  it.) <br>

                  appears set in the present day, but the film makers apparently
                  made great effort to avoid references (technological or otherwise)
                  that would place the film at any particular time over the past
                  thirty years. The effect is to suggest that certain parts of
                  the rural South have not changed much: blacks are still having
                  a hard time getting respect. (The plot floats in this time indefiniteness
                  despite a large number of product placements. A multiple page
                  list during the closing credits detracts from the lingering beauty
                  of the film's final scene.)<br>
<br>
                  Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs plays a death row inmate named Lawrence.
                  We never learn about the crimes that earned him his place at
                  the head of the line for execution in Georgia's electric chair.
                  (Georgia only recently abandoned this form of execution.) His
                  wife, Leticia, played by Halle Barry, visits the prison weekly,
                  but only for the benefit of their son, an obese and disturbed
                  teenager. Lawrence tries to be a good father, considering his
                  circumstances, and his eleventh hour apology to Leticia for the
                  bad things he has done, and his admonition to his son not to
                  be like him, illustrate that he sees himself as a different person
                  from his former self. <br>
<br>
                  In graphic detail, the film shows preparations for the execution,
                  presided over with mechanistic precision by Hank, played by Billy
                  Bob Thornton, a misogynist and racist colonel in the Georgia
                  prison system. In contrast to Lawrence, we learn quite a bit
                  about Hank's misdeeds. Thornton never has to act very hard when
                  he's playing a redneck, but Hank is not your average cracker,
                  and Hank employs all of Thornton's ample talent. He lives with
                  his father, a retired career officer in the Georgia prison system
                  and an even worse monster than he is, and his son, Sonny, whom
                  both are trying unsuccessfully to raise in their own image. The
                  problem is that Sonny has a sensitive side, and doesn't seem
                  cut out for the executioner's trade.<br>
<br>
                  Although Hank despises Lawrence, a black man, he seems determined
                  to provide Lawrence with a dignified execution. This perverse
                  form of customer service, in a proceeding that involves shaving
                  all of Lawrence's head and body hair and then watching him shake
                  violently while his bodily fluids boil during the electrical
                  surges, doesn't tolerate any error. When Sonny vomits during
                  the &quot;final walk,&quot; Hank comes unhinged and disowns his
                  only son, causing his violent death. When you are in the execution
                  business, sudden death doesn't have much of an impact, and Sonny
                  doesn't get much of funeral. Grandpa's eulogy is simply, &quot;He
                  was weak.&quot;<br>
                   <br>
                  Finally realizing that he has been affected by his son's death
                  (he can't get it up with a hooker), Hank begins to turn. He resigns
                  his prison post, and burns his uniform. Eventually, he crosses
                  paths with Leticia, whom he meets while she is mourning the loss
                  of her son, not realizing that she is Lawrence's wife. His own
                  redemptive need to be kind to another human being, whom he eventually
                  realizes is in much worse circumstances than he is, combined
                  with his sexual attraction for Leticia, begin to dismantle his
                  racial hatred. At her initiative, he has the first face-to-face
                  intercourse he has probably had in some time, and then he is
                  hooked. His secret discovery of her connection to Lawrence, when
                  he utters one of the most awkward post-coital apologies ever
                  to grace the screen, only seems to spur him on. He falls all
                  over himself to be nice to her, as if making up for a lifetime
                  of meanness.<br>
<br>
                  Anyone who sees the first thirty minutes of this film will probably
                  judge Hank to be evil, someone who should be punished for his
                  actions and probably segregated from the rest of society for
                  our protection. Yet, Hank never confesses the contents of his
                  closet to Leticia. He never tells her that he executed her husband,
                  never explains that he caused his own son's death. She manages
                  to transcend her discovery of this first fact, perhaps realizing
                  that she is now part of a miraculous transformation. At least
                  Lawrence, the convicted murderer, had the courage to admit he
                  was wrong. But Hank seems inclined to brush it all under the
                  table and move on.<br>
                  The only thing that separates them, given that we don't know
                  the details of Lawrence's crime, is the criminal justice system.
                  Lawrence, having been convicted, is precluded from transcending
                  his circumstances and earning forgiveness. No matter what he
                  does, he is going to die for his sins. Hank, by contrast, on
                  the other side of the bars, can simply walk away from his past
                  and start over. Both situations seem wrong. Hank has no accountability
                  for his actions; Lawrence has no chance. This reality makes the
                  system seem frighteningly arbitrary. Although the monster in
                  the title of the film refers to Lawrence and others like him,
                  it appears the real monster is the system itself.<br>
<br>
                  (All this is an ironic case of art imitating life: Puffy Combs,
                  rap music star, walked away from charges relating to a night
                  club shooting that led conviction of a protege. Some believe
                  Combs' wealth and fame played a part in his &quot;beating the
                  rap.&quot;)<br>
<br>
                  One other aspect of the death penalty is implicitly criticized
                  by the film-the execution's effect on others. It is true that
                  many good soldiers or prison guards are personality types that
                  are themselves but one step away from the wrong side of the law,
                  but we need to ask ourselves whether the psychological damage
                  done by the execution business is worth the cost. What mayhem
                  do we foster by training thousands of prison guards to be efficient
                  executioners? If the death penalty is a significant factor in
                  the greater propensity of the sons of death row inmates to follow
                  in their fathers' footsteps, is the death penalty worth the cost
                  of the wasted lives and additional murders it may foster? See
                  <i>Monster's Ball</i> and decide for yourself.</font></p>
