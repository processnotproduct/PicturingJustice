                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Paul Joseph</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There are a number of similarities
                  between the new ABC Supreme Court show, <i>The Court</i>, and
                  its competition, <i><a href="firstmonday_joseph.htm">First Monday</a></i>.
                  Both focus on a new Justice appointed to an evenly divided (liberal/conservative)
                  Supreme Court. Both purport to take us &quot;behind the scenes&quot;
                  to watch the Court's inner workings. Both focus on the interpersonal
                  relations between the Justices and between the Justices and their
                  clerks. Both move us out of the courtroom to address the human
                  side of the cases. Both use the device of news and commentary
                  television as a sort of Greek chorus, commenting on the action.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/court4.jpg" width="191" height="155" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Despite
                  these structural similarities, the programs are dramatically
                  different. While <i>First Monday</i> quickly sunk into self-parody,
                  clownish characterizations and downright embarrassing portrayals
                  of court personnel and procedure, <i>The Court</i>, with its
                  intelligent writing and careful plot-crafting, delivers a classy
                  adult drama.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sally Field, as newly appointed
                  Justice without ideology Kate Nolan, heads an experienced cast
                  of players who, even in the first show, deliver convincing and
                  interesting portrayals. When, at the end of the program, reporter
                  Harlan Brandt (Craig Bierko) tells us that Nolan, like the inmate
                  in a case before the Court, has also been given a kind of &quot;life
                  sentence,&quot; our response is that we want to come back and
                  watch as it unfolds. We have the sense that not only Kate Nolan
                  but all the principal characters have lives with depths not yet
                  obvious and that there is plenty of room for the emotional landscape
                  to deepen with time.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The device of the cynical and
                  hungry investigative reporter gets us out of the Court and allows
                  a second dramatic stream, a continuing &quot;outsider&quot; commentary
                  and critique of the Court, its people, the cases and the political
                  institutions of government. We shouldn't see anything on <i>The
                  Court</i> as devastatingly bad as the scene in <i>First Monday</i>
                  where the Justice asked questions of the party (rather than the
                  lawyer), a heavy-handed attempt by less adept writers to pump
                  up the drama. <i>The Court</i> is smarter than that and in the
                  hands of veteran writer/producer Carol Flint, it is easy to trust
                  that sufficient tools exist to make such embarrassing stuff unnecessary.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If there is one (muted) criticism
                  of <i>The Court</i> in its first episode, it is that the explanation
                  of the legal issues surrounding the &quot;three strikes&quot;
                  case before the Court was a bit murky. I doubt whether viewers
                  came away with a clear understanding of the issue. Yet, the episode
                  had so much to do-establishing setting, character and conflict-that
                  this lapse is forgivable. <i><a href="west-wing-joseph.htm">West
                  Wing</a></i> has found it possible to explain political issues
                  of complexity and depth in a few simple sentences and <i>The
                  Court</i> seems headed in the same direction. If it takes a few
                  episodes to reach nirvana, I'm willing to wait.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Court</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is what <i>First Monday</i> was not--a
                  well written, carefully crafted drama with winning adult characters
                  about whom we care. It's good television and has the potential
                  to be very good legal television, too. The Court is now in session.
                  Call the next case!</font></p>
