                  </i></font></b><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
                  by Christine Alice Corcos</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The USA television series <i><a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/series/monk/">Monk</a></i> has
                  been touted as highly original, well acted, clever and careful
                  (about its main character, an obsessive-compulsive detective
                  whose disability has disqualified him from further service as
                  a police officer). <i>Monk</i> is indeed well acted and scripted,
                  although some of the episodes are derivative of earlier shows
                  like <i><a href="http://www.columbo-site.freeuk.com/">Columbo</a></i>.
                  In particular, Monk usually solves the crime by noticing that
                  one of the suspects has a particular quirk that guarantees that
                  he or she is the only person who could have committed the crime.
                  Monk, like Columbo, looks for one crucial characteristic or event,
                  and then identifies the perpetrator.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/jonathan_creek.jpg" width="253" height="98" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">By
                  contrast, the BBC series <i>Jonathan Creek</i> (broadcast here
                  on BBC America) emphasizes the &quot;howdunit&quot; rather than
                  the &quot;whodunit&quot; in order to solve the crime. Creek (Alan
                  Davies) is a furry headed and tennis-shoed young magician who
                  creates illusions for a self-absorbed stage performer named Adam
                  Klaus (played by Anthony Head in the first season and Stuart
                  Milligan in subsequent years) when he isn't being dragged into
                  the investigation of mysterious crimes by journalist and off
                  again on again love interest Madeline Magellan (Caroline Quentin,
                  who may also be familiar to American audiences via the series
                  <i>Men Behaving Badly</i>). Quentin left the series in 1999,
                  to be replaced by Julia Sawalha as publicist Carla Borrega. This
                  week, Sawalha's episodes hit the U. S. airwaves, with the episode
                  <i>Satan's Chimney</i>. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Jonathan Creek's knowledge
                  of stage magic makes him a perfect detective. He does not subscribe
                  to the idea that &quot;seeing is believing.&quot; If what he
                  sees or is told about defies his understanding of the world,
                  he suspects a trick, and sets out to figure out how it is done.
                  Like Columbo and Adrian Monk, Creek is vitally interested in
                  the puzzle and its solution, but unlike them he stops often short
                  of involving the police.  Since Creek and Maddy Magellan are
                  private citizens, they are much more concerned with justice than
                  with the law, and their desire to see justice done informs many
                  of their adventures. The episodes track the solution of the crimes,
                  but also the necessity to make victims whole as much as possible,
                  rather than to turn perpetrators over to the authorities. In
                  the episode <i>The Scented Room</i>, a valuable painting disappears
                  within 30 seconds from a locked room. Creek discovers how the
                  deed was done, but refuses to divulge the truth to the owners,
                  preferring to satisfy himself that his solution is the correct
                  one by confronting the thieves. Indeed, one might question whether
                  a theft really has occurred. As Creek reconstructs the crime,
                  the painting is actually taken from its frame and simply secreted
                  elsewhere in the room. The perpetrators deprive the owners of
                  the enjoyment of their property, but do they really commit a
                  crime, according to the letter of the law?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the episode <i>The Curious
                  Tale of Mr. Spearfish</i>, Jonathan discovers why an otherwise
                  unexceptional young man believes that the Devil has taken his
                  soul. The young man and his wife have been having strange experiences,
                  as well as a remarkable run of good luck. Why? As it turns out,
                  no evil spirits need apply-the story has an utterly mundane,
                  if somewhat factually unlikely solution. Satisfied that his solution
                  is the right one, Jonathan does not reveal it to the young couple.
                   Instead, he ensures that they work out their marital problems
                  and then moves on. In <i>The Omega Man</i>, Jonathan solves the
                  riddle of the EBE (extraterrestrial biological entity), proving
                  that it is man made and blackmailing the U. S. military man who
                  has harassed his friend Maddy into giving him 60,000 pounds to
                  fund an animal shelter for Maddy's four-footed friends.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Jonathan Creek's notion of
                  ethics is an unusual one for American audiences used to the sometimes
                  excessively moralizing of law and order shows. Unless an innocent
                  person is physically or emotionally harmed, he is reluctant to
                  call in the police, and he cooperates very unwillingly with the
                  government, finding that police officers and other officials
                  are both inflexible and not very bright. His moral code is the
                  highlight of episodes such as <i>Danse Macabre</i> in which he
                  discovers that a daughter and her stepfather have helped a dying
                  woman to commit suicide. While Jonathan is not opposed to euthanasia,
                  he finds unacceptable the fact that the daughter's husband, a
                  minister, has been involved unwittingly and unwillingly in the
                  event. In addition, of course, the crime is technically murder,
                  and though Jonathan does not inform the police, he does confront
                  the daughter and stepfather in order to let them know that he
                  knows how the crime was committed. On seeing the husband's reaction,
                  we understand that he will very likely leave his wife, even if
                  he does not call in the authorities.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Jonathan Creek offers us a
                  picture of a more complex character than Adrian Monk or Lieutenant
                  Columbo, and consequently a much more complex view of the intersection
                  between law and justice.  Creek is an even more neurotic Sherlock
                  Holmes, he is cerebral rather than active, and his involvement
                  is often reluctant. Maddy frequently needs to goad or dare him
                  into activity.  He is also much less physically attractive and
                  picture perfect than other television magicians, such as Alexander
                  Blacke (<i>Blacke's Magic</i>, starring Hal Linden) or Anthony
                  Dorian (<i>The Magician</i>, starring Bill Bixby). Once he takes
                  an interest in a puzzle, however, he refuses to let it lie. He
                  is a good person in an increasingly bad world. Creek also emphasizes
                  critical thinking, a skill sadly lacking in many people today.
                  When faced with what seems to be an otherwordly or &quot;impossible&quot;
                  mystery, he does not automatically assume that the correct answer
                  is a supernatural one. In fact, he never assumes that the supernatural
                  is the answer. Instead, he looks for rational, real world explanations.
                  The episode <i>Jack in the Box</i> presents the type of &quot;locked
                  room mystery&quot; that typifies the <i>Jonathan Creek</i> series.
                  A once famous comedian is found dead in a locked bunker. Did
                  he commit suicide? If so, how? Creek decides that if he was murdered,
                  and the murderer could not have escaped the bunker, then &quot;whatever
                  remains, however improbable must be the truth&quot;-the murderer
                  must still be somewhere in the bunker. And so he solves the mystery,
                  and reveals a story of bitter revenge. The murderer has claimed
                  for many years that he was innocent of the murder of which he
                  was convicted, the murder of the comedian's wife. Through Maddy's
                  efforts, he was finally exonerated and released from prison.
                  As it turns out, he really did commit the deed-at the behest
                  of the comedian.  Having decided that the ex-con must be the
                  murderer, Jonathan then unravels the truth.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">What is most refreshing about
                  Jonathan Creek as a hero, and what seems to explain his success
                  as a cult figure in England and in the US, is that he is both
                  lovably nerdy and extremely competent. In addition, his own sure
                  sense of right and wrong leads Jonathan toward justice and toward
                  truth. He is no lawyer, but Jonathan Creek has a sure sense of
                  the meaning of equity.<br>
