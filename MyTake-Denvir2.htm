      used to listen to a radio show when I was a boy which began with a deep bass voice saying,
      &#147;Who knows what evil lurks within the hearts of men? The Shadow knows.&#148;</font> <font face="Verdana">Movies know, too. Films make the human psyche visible as heroes and
      villains act out scripts we already have in our imaginations; they give us a glimpse of
      the human psychology behind law-breaking&#150;and law&#150;making. </font><br>
      <br>
      <font face="Verdana">Alfred Hitchcock&#146;s <i>Vertigo</i> is a good example of film
      revealing the &#147;darker&#148; side of human nature. When we<img align="right" alt="verigo1.jpg (3842 bytes)" hspace="20" src="images/verigo1.jpg" vspace="20" width="150" height="100">
      first meet &quot;Scotty&quot; Ferguson (James Stewart) we immediately recognize him as a
      man who puts a premium on &quot;control&quot; in his life. Not a surprising personality
      trait in a former lawyer who is now a retired San Francisco police detective. Scotty has
      little interest in life, and less in sex. His only friend is Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes),
      whose painfully obvious love for him he ignores; in fact, the only sexual interest he
      exhibits is the mixture of fascination, fear and disdain he demonstrates in inspecting a
      bra he finds in her apartment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Scotty seems a harmless, if lonely, man, but Hitchcock shows us
      that he has the potential to become a sadist, a monster whose need to remake the world and
      people in the image of his fantasies leads to violence. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">During the first hour of the film, Scotty forms an erotic
      attachment to a frosty blonde aristocrat named Madeleine (Kim Novak) he is hired to
      follow. He has been told by her husband that Madeleine has threatened suicide and Scotty
      earnestly tries to save her from that fate, but he is unsuccessful. When she does die, he
      blames himself for her death and falls into deep depression. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">A year later he sees a young woman on the street who looks like a
      working&#150;class image of his lost love. He follows her to her hotel where she claims to
      be Judy Barton, a salesgirl in a San Francisco department store. <img align="left" alt="vertigo2.jpg (4213 bytes)" hspace="20" src="images/vertigo2.jpg" vspace="20" width="150" height="100">He
      asks her out. Here the sadism begins. Hitchcock changes the perspective of the film from
      that of Scotty to that of Judy, his new &quot;love.&quot; But the audience quickly sees
      that Scotty has no interest in Judy other than in recreating her in the image of the dead
      Madeleine. Accordingly, we see from Judy's perspective his badgering need to change her
      hair color, her hair style, her clothes, every detail of behavior which allows her to be
      herself. No excuse can stop him from bending her towards the goal of recreating his
      necrophiliac fantasy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Eventually he discovers that she <u>is</u> in fact his lost love,
      and that he has been the victim of a ruse to conceal a murder. Despite her relative
      innocence and pleas that she has risked discovery only because she so loves him, Scotty
      finds no forgiveness within himself and hounds Judy to her death. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Scotty's sadistic treatment of Judy is even more troubling when we
      consider how he got involved with her as Madeline in the first place. He took the job of
      following her, not for the money, but because he was intrigued by the story told about her
      and wanted to solve the mystery; then he became protective of her as a lost innocent whom
      he wanted to save from a suicidal fate. Finally, he became sexually obsessed with her. So
      we see the Madeleine/Judy transformed in Scotty's mind from a piece in an intellectual
      puzzle, to an innocent victim, to romantic love, to sexual icon, to duplicitous fraud, to
      object of revenge. Yet all along it was just working&#150;class Judy Barton, a woman
      Scotty never knew at all.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">This phenomenon of a male a character setting out to
      &quot;save&quot; a woman only to end up as her executioner is not limited to <i>Vertigo</i>
      or to Hitchcock. We see a similar phenomenon in John Ford's <i>The Searchers</i><u>.</u>
      Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) shows us a similar transformation from savior to sadist in his
      actions towards his niece Debbie (Natalie Wood). The young pre- pubescent Debbie has been
      kidnaped by red Indians and the &quot;search&quot; starts as an attempt to rescue her, but
      as the years pass and it becomes clear that she has become a woman cohabiting with an
      Indian warrior, the object of the search changes from saving Debbie to exterminating her
      because her &#147;purity&#148; has been polluted by sleeping with a nonwhite. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">In both films, the audience recognizes that the protagonists are
      being driven by factors beyond their control, or even conscious knowledge. How should we
      react to films like these? Are they telling us something of value? Some say we should
      treat movies as mere entertainments with no connection to &#147;real&#148; life. But this
      seems a short-sighted view. The reason we are attracted to film narratives is because in
      some sense we identify with the characters&#146; emotions. For instance, while I would
      never commit the criminal acts perpetrated by the protagonists in <i>A Simple Plan</i>, it
      is only because I can identify with their greed that I find the movie engrossing. On the
      other hand, it would be a mistake to accept films like <i>Vertigo</i> and <i>The Searchers</i>
      as accurate social reportage, proof of an incontrovertible sexism and racism which poisons
      the white male psyche. This view confuses fiction with reality. </font><br>
      <br>
      <font face="Verdana">I think watching films like <i>Vertigo</i> and <i>The Searchers</i><img align="right" alt="vertigo3.jpg (3741 bytes)" hspace="20" src="images/vertigo3.jpg" vspace="20" width="150" height="100">
      should convince us that, no matter how many times your Torts professor told you otherwise,
      there is no such thing as the &#147;reasonable person&#148;; we are all affected by
      unconscious motivations which color our social interactions. Most likely these unconscious
      motivations are even stronger when sex and/or race are involved.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana"><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> recently published a
      study which showed that when patients of different races and sexes all reported the same
      symptoms to doctors, they received radically different diagnoses. The white male patients
      were selected for the highest quality care. I don&#146;t think this means these doctors
      were &#147;racists&#148; or &#147;sexists&#148; in any active sense of those words, but it
      does appear that they unconsciously attributed greater &#147;value&#148; to white male
      patients.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">The Supreme Court decided a case a few years ago which made the
      same point. The plaintiff was an African-American who had been convicted in Georgia of
      murder and sentenced to death. He challenged his conviction on the theory that racial
      motivation had influenced the white prosecutor&#146;s decision to ask for the death
      penalty and the white jury&#146;s decision to vote to inflict it. In support of his suit,
      his lawyers presented a sophisticated statistical study which showed that a black man
      accused of killing a white was eight times more likely to receive the death penalty in
      Georgia than a white who killed a black. The study was entirely consistent with <i>The New
      England Journal of Medicine</i> study; a white life was just considered more valuable. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">This, of course, does not mean that the prosecutors or juries in
      Georgia were &#147;racist&#148; in the sense of consciously applying different standards
      on the basis of race, but it does seem likely that racial stereotypes unconsciously
      influenced their decision.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">The Supreme Court rejected the plaintiff&#146;s study and upheld
      his death sentence. One senses that the Court felt that accepting the existence of
      unconscious racial motivation would somehow undermine the public&#146;s belief in the
      neutrality of the law. It would be reassuring to believe that unconscious racial prejudice
      doesn&#146;t affect our justice system from top to bottom just as it would be reassuring
      to believe that it was mere coincidence that the unarmed man the New York police shot
      forty-one times was a minority. But we do know that it is not true. The interesting
      question is not whether unconscious racial sexual prejudice exists, but what we, including
      the Supreme Court, are willing to do about it. Because, no matter how strident the
      Court&#146;s denials, the Shadow knows. <p>
