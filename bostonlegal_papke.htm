                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Satire in <i>Boston Legal</i></font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by David Papke</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Boston Legal</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> does not add to the convention of
                  the dramatic courtroom trial that has been a mainstay of primetime
                  legal drama since the emergence of network programming in the
                  late 1940s. <i>Boston Legal</i> also does not significantly advance
                  the portrayal of small law firms, the lawyers therein, and the
                  tortured relationships among them. <i>L. A. Law</i> established
                  the law firm sub-genre in the late 1980s, and it has continued
                  to be part of primetime through <i>The Practice</i> up to the
                  present. However, <i>Boston Legal</i> has given television viewers
                  a fresh satirical look at lawyers and legal practice, and this
                  satirical dimension of the series may be its most noteworthy
                  feature. The viewing public's positive response to satire in
                  <i>Boston Legal</i> may also be suggestive of what lawyers have
                  come to represent in the culture of postmodern America.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/bostonlegal 1.jpg" width="155" height="104" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Satire is a venerable
                  form of cultural expression that lampoons or ridicules a subject
                  by making it look ridiculous. If well executed, satire amuses
                  the reader or viewer more so than it provokes hatred or contempt.
                  There is a lightness or playfulness to the best satire. How does
                  satire differ from comedy in general? Comedy produces laughter
                  in and of itself, but satire is more specialized. In playfully
                  deriding and derogating, satire makes fun of something that exists
                  outside the given anecdote, short story, movie, or television
                  drama. The chief satirical target in <i>Boston Legal</i> is the
                  legal profession and, in particular, self-impressed and immoral
                  lawyers.<br>
<br>
                  The two most developed satirical characters in the series are
                  Denny Crane and Alan Shore. The former is portrayed by William
                  Shatner, who is of course known to one and all for his portrayal
                  of Captain James T. Kirk in Star Trek. Earlier in his career
                  Shatner also played an earnest law clerk in the heavy-handed
                  film <i>Judgment at Nuremberg</i> (1961) and an idealistic prosecutor
                  in <i>For the People</i> (CBS; 1965). In <i>Boston Legal</i>
                  Shatner's Denny Crane is a buffoonish lawyer, who seems to suffer
                  from some variety of dementia but who nevertheless continues
                  to believe he is &quot;the greatest trial attorney that ever
                  lived.&quot; Crane frequently conveys this sentiment with the
                  simple phrase &quot;Denny Crane.&quot; Yes, some lawyers are
                  a deluded, unduly self-impressed lot, and what's even more sobering
                  is that the inept courts and superficial legal system often defer
                  - or so <i>Boston Legal</i> tells us - to these delusions and
                  self-impressions.<br>
<br>
                  James Spader plays the lawyer Alan Shore. Less recognizable for
                  viewers than Shatner, Spader has nevertheless strung together
                  a long list of acting credits, often playing characters with
                  a pathological side. Especially noteworthy in this regard is
                  his creepy performance in the film <i>Sex, Lies, and Videotape</i>
                  (1989). In <i>Boston Legal</i> Shore has left the firm of Young,
                  Berlutti &amp; Fruitt of The Practice and joined the more white-shoe
                  Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt, where he has made his mark taking
                  (and usually winning) cases nobody else wants. Shore does not
                  let such things as integrity and honesty impede his practice.
                  His conduct and comments are a satire of the conduct and comments
                  of the ethically-challenged lawyer, who is the source of so many
                  jokes and cartoons in contemporary American culture. How are
                  lawyers different than vultures? Only lawyers qualify for frequent-flyer
                  mileage.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Boston Legal</i> is only partially satirical, and it is not
                  the first primetime legal drama to satirize lawyers. Ally McBeal's
                  partner John Cage, after all, prepared for trial by listening
                  to Barry White tapes, and he was the best litigator in the firm!
                  However, the sustained excellence of the satire in <i>Boston
                  Legal</i> is notable, and when we finish laughing and smirking,
                  we might contemplate what the lawyer has come to symbolize in
                  our culture. Gone and perhaps not even remembered is De Tocqueville's
                  sense that lawyers were America's most honored and distinguished
                  profession, the symbolic elite of a democratic people. In contemporary
                  America they might and often do serve as the butt of satire.
