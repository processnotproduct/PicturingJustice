            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">&quot;State
            and Main&quot; is an intersection. It&#146;s an intersection
            where a traffic accident takes place, but more importantly, an
            intersection of two cultures. You could say it&#146;s a meeting
            of the Hollywood Slicks and the Vermont Hicks, and you wouldn&#146;t
            be wrong. But I think that<img src="images/Julia Stiles stars as Carla.jpg" width="214" height="186" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">
            writer/director David Mamet goes out of his way to make the crucial
            intersection be between Jew and Gentile. It&#146;s a Hollywood
            movie about ethnic prejudice.</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">The film chronicles
            what transpires when a Hollywood film crew invades a rural Vermont
            village to make a movie entitled &quot;The Old Mill.&quot; But
            Mamet makes the moviemakers Jewish and the villagers Scot. Each
            group has its icon; the Jews are identified with matzos, the
            Scots by their tam &#145;o shanters.</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">We see the
            two tribes meet on a public and a private level. On the public
            level, their meetings are tense. The Hollywoods are cynical,
            the locals suspicious. The worst traits of each group are represented
            by one member. Readers of Picturing Justice will not be surprised
            that each is a lawyer. The Jewish villain is Marty Rossen (David
            Paymer), who portrays a stereotypical, fast-talking Jewish Hollywood
            producer who is both hilarious and revolting in his no-holds-barred
            attempt to muscle adversaries to his will. Rossen is so overdrawn
            that viewers might wonder why Mamet, himself a Jew, would create
            him, but I think Mamet has his reasons. He really is setting
            Rossen up to be compared to the openly anti-Semitic Doug MacKenzie.
            MacKenzie is ambitious, devious, and corrupt. In fact, he&#146;s
            a lot like Rossen. But Rossen at least is not a hypocrite. Rossen
            gets the last laugh when he greets the sanctimonious MacKenzie
            in Yiddish when he delivers a bribe to him. The message is clear:
            MacKenzie displays all the vices he attributes to Rossen. They
            are members of the same tribe.</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">But the comparison
            of MacKenzie and Rossen is only the first of Mamet&#146;s Jew-gentile
            intersections. There is also a meeting on the private level.
            Here we see a romance ignite between Jewish playwright /screenwriter
            Joe White and gentile local book store owner Ann Black. Here
            the intersection is successful, not because the characters struggle
            to transcend ethnicity but because they are blissfully unaware
            of it. White is a sweet, shy, tongue-tied young writer. We only
            know he&#146;s Jewish by the box of matzo in his room. When the
            sexy female star played by Sarah Jessica Parker notices the matzos,
            she attempts to flirt with him by saying, &quot; I love Jewish
            men.&quot; White&#146;s reply is the key to the movie. He asks
            &quot;Why?&quot; Why would you like or dislike anyone just because
            they were Jewish?</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">When Black
            spots the box of matzos, she asks if she can have a cracker.
            She has lots of reasons for loving White, none of them related
            to ethnicity. White (Jew) and Black (gentile) find they really
            belong to the same tribe: the one that likes books, amateur theatricals,
            small town papers, and quiet walks with lots of talk.</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">I think Mamet
            is telling us that the only possible future for America is assimilation.
            That doesn&#146;t mean that we can&#146;t honor the contributions
            which different groups have made, but in the end we have to relate
            as individuals, not members of ethnic groups. Mamet has introduced
            this same theme before in </font><em><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><a href="articles/homicide.htm">Homicide</a></font></em><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">. In that movie Bobby
            Gold (Joe Mantegna) was haunted by the anti-semitism he perceived
            in the behavior of his police colleagues. His Irish partner Tim
            Sullivan ( William <img src="images/Director David Mamet_with Alec Baldwin.jpg" width="215" height="196" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Macey)
            dismissed his accusations and told him they should get on with
            their job. But Gold became involved with a Jewish terrorist organization
            which played on his ethnic identity. They kept asking him why
            he wasn&#146;t loyal to his own people. Eventually the Jewish
            group betrayed Gold, but not before causing him to miss an appointment
            with Sullivan which led to Sullivan&#146;s death. Too late Gold
            discovered that his true &quot;tribe&quot; was Jewish, and Irish.
            Communities should be based on mutual affection, not ethnic identity.</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">The final scene
            in &quot;State and Main&quot; shows a judge donning his tam &#145;o
            shanter to get in a few holes of golf after work. He&#146;s an
            African-American. Like Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus, he knows
            he belongs to the greatest tribe of all -- the golfers.</font>&nbsp;</p>
