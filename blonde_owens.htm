                  by John Owens</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
                  What's the most intense movie you've ever seen? <i>Taxi Driver</i>?
                  <i>Raging Bull</i>? Maybe <i>Do The Right Thing</i> or <i>White
                  Heat</i>?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">My choice? It's a no-brainer:
                  <i>Legally Blonde</i>.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/legally blonde 8.jpg" width="130" height="130" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Legally
                  Blonde</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">? Isn't that
                  the &quot;cute&quot; movie currently in theaters starring Reese
                  Witherspoon as Elle Woods, the ultimately not-so-ditzy blonde
                  sorority queen who follows her ex-boyfriend to Harvard Law School?
                  The classic Hollywood fish-out-of-water tale, right? You can
                  imagine the pitch -- &quot;It's <i>Clueless</i> meets <i>The
                  Paper Chase!</i>&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Perhaps. But it has been lurking
                  in my background for more than five years, and for one evening,
                  it held me in the greatest suspense since Geraldo went looking
                  for Al Capone's vault.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Why <i>Legally Blonde</i>?
                  Well, what else is there to see this summer besides <i>Shrek</i>?
                  (Not <i>America's Sweethearts</i>, trust me.) <i>Legally Blonde</i>
                  is a very entertaining movie, but it held my attention so closely
                  because it had the potential to tell my story at Stanford Law
                  School.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">No, I'm not blonde (at least
                  not a chemically altered blonde). I'm not a sorority queen. And
                  I don't think I'm ditzy. What I am is a classmate of Amanda Brown,
                  the author of the book upon which the movie was based. You see,
                  for years my classmates and I have heard rumors that Amanda was
                  working on a tell-all about our class &#150; <i>One Elle</i>,
                  as the book was supposedly titled. Considering that Scott Turow
                  and Edward Lazarus had little problem exposing the foibles of
                  their legal classmates and co-workers, why couldn't Amanda do
                  the same? Yet, when I checked bookstores for her work, I found
                  nothing. It was as if the book never existed. I thought I was
                  safe.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Boy was I wrong. Amanda's book
                  has hit the electronic shelves as an e-book (available at <a href="http://www.1stbooks.com/">http://www.1stbooks.com/</a>),
                  and soon will be available in bookstores. And it became a blockbuster
                  movie -- something not even Turow or Lazarus can claim about
                  their tell-alls.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Although the movie is set at
                  Harvard Law School, Stanford Law School is clearly the true setting.
                  An early orientation scene in which the law students introduce
                  their degrees before introducing themselves comes straight from
                  my orientation at Stanford, as do several of Elle's experiences
                  with obnoxious law students.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But what about me? On the one
                  hand, I really wanted someone to play me as the smart and dashing
                  superstud law student that I've convinced myself that I was.
                  On the other hand, I feared the embarrassing truth: that I was
                  a law student who studied too much, and was at times so socially
                  awkward that I left an answering machine message for one of Amanda's
                  friends that made the famous answering machine message in <i>Swingers</i>
                  look like a simple wrong number. Would it portray some of my
                  greatest triumphs, such as posting &quot;Happy 32nd Birthday,
                  Dalila&quot; flyers all over the law school, knowing full well
                  that my friend Dalila was turning only 26? Or my greatest failures,
                  such as telling one law firm partner during on-campus interviews
                  that I was looking for a firm where I could work 9 to 5? (What
                  was I thinking?)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It turns out that the movie
                  was loosely based on Stanford, with no specific references to
                  my classmates -- or, more important, to me. Apparently, the producers
                  concluded that my classmates and I were too boring to justify
                  two hours of celluloid.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But I was not off the hook
                  yet -- there was Amanda's book. The book made me really nervous,
                  as Amanda was its sole source, unsoiled by Hollywood's sausage
                  factory. In large part, my fear was valid. Many of the book's
                  characters are composites of several people, including my law
                  school classmates. Crothers, Stanford's first-year student dorm,
                  plays an early but important role in the book. And Stanford's
                  sadistic policy of releasing first-year grades on Valentine's
                  Day -- the Valentine's Day Massacre -- is accurately depicted.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As for me? I came away unscathed.
                  Or did I? A character named Johnno appears sporadically throughout
                  the book. Considering that Johnno sounds a lot like John Owens,
                  I became suspicious. Amanda describes Johnno as a &quot;square
                  jawed, bright-eyed, athletic entertainment lawyer.&quot; I'll
                  accept that description, even though the &quot;athletic entertainment
                  lawyer&quot; might be a stretch. Yet the comparison ended once
                  I read that Johnno had &quot;a busier social life than most students,
                  and to talk to him was to discover that he was not the brightest
                  bulb on the tree.&quot; That is not true. I had a busier social
                  life than all students, if you define social life as hangin'
                  in the Law Review library with Turbo, my ultra-cool black-and-white
                  Toshiba notebook computer.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Actually, I had no social life
                  at Stanford, but more important to me, I'd like to think I was
                  one of the brighter bulbs on the class of 1996 tree. Was Johnno
                  Amanda's poetic-license revenge? If so, what did I do to anger
                  Amanda? Or was this all merely a coincidence? There was only
                  one way to find out: I went to the source, Amanda. She assured
                  me that Johnno is based on several people, but not me.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Though I am relieved that I
                  am not Johnno (or even part of Johnno), I'm also disappointed
                  that I made such a minuscule impression on Amanda in law school.
                  Few can say they were immortalized in a movie or book, and I
                  missed my chance, though I'm sure several of my classmates would
                  happily switch places with me.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Did I learn anything from this
                  experience, other than a need to keep my vanity in check? This
                  experience reminded me of how important it is to respect everyone,
                  no matter who they appear to be. In <i>Legally Blonde</i>, Elle's
                  classmates don't take her seriously until she wins the big trial.
                  The lesson I learned from the movie and the book is not to wait
                  until the big trial to treat someone well; start at the beginning.
                  After all, that paralegal you've been tormenting might be the
                  future law clerk deciding whether to grant your motion for an
                  extension. Or even worse, she could be a screenwriter. And we
                  all know how big-firm lawyers come off in movies.</font></p>
