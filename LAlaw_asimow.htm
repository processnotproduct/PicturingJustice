            was about law the way it's practiced today--in firms, for dollars.
            Today, we want our TV lawyers to be realistic. We know that the
            law is full of shadowy ethical conflicts without simple answers,
            that the adversary system often conceals the truth and produces
            injustice, that clients are not all innocent or even decent people,
            and that practicing law is a tough and very stressful way to
            make a living. Lawyers on TV (and in real life) often wonder
            what they hell they are doing with their lives.</font></center>

                  REUNIONS--<i>LA LAW</i>: THE MOVIE</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Ever gone to a high school
                  reunion? There's guilty pleasure in seeing how everyone has aged
                  while you, of course, look just like you did the day you graduated.
                  Or you can revel in how the ones who were most popular and successful
                  in high school have struggled to get by in later life.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/LAlaw.jpg" width="123" height="204" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Similar
                  pleasures attended the tenth reunion of the law firm of McKenzie,
                  Brackman. Here they were--most of the old cast members of <i>LA
                  Law</i>--together again! Why, it was the very same crowd that
                  spent an hour a week in our living room from 1986 to 1994 (before
                  the show fizzled out amid a departure of key cast members and
                  an epidemic of weak scripts). And now we find out what's happened
                  to each of them in the ensuing ten years. This was the show that
                  was a ratings sensation in its early years and attracted hordes
                  of money-hungry applicants to the law schools.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">How wonderful to see these
                  old friends again! Leland McKenzie has retired and is clipping
                  roses in Montecito but Douglas Brackman is still managing partner.
                  Indeed, Douglas' son is now an associate with the firm, but he
                  doesn't exactly share Douglas' bottom-line approach to law. Michael
                  Kuzak has left the firm and now runs a successful bar (Michael
                  gave up the law after a client for whom he had won an acquittal
                  raped and killed a new victim). Arnie Becker--yes, good old Arnie--is
                  going through a divorce from his much younger wife. Stuart Markowitz
                  and Ann Kelsey--who are still married and have a kid at Crossroads
                  School--have opened their hearts (and their checking account)
                  to their guru. Benny Stulwicz --still there, fetching Starbucks
                  and Krispy Kremes for the staff. Roxanne, now the office manager,
                  is still having problems with her dorky ex, Dave. Grace Van Owen
                  has become Los Angeles DA and is as tough and tight-lipped as
                  ever. And so on.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But wait--they look so much
                  older than when we saw them last! Roxanne has put on a lot of
                  weight and Arnie has lost his hair. He's just not the hunk he
                  used to be. Douglas and Leland look much older. Grace, Stuart
                  and Ann are aging, too. Michael Kuzak looks terrific.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The reunion movie wasn't one
                  of the best LA Laws (at least as I recall them) but it wasn't
                  bad either. I thought the energy level was quite a bit lower
                  than the way I remembered it. The main story involved Kuzak's
                  coming out of retirement to handle a stay of execution for a
                  client he had represented years ago. Entertainingly, but implausibly,
                  Kuzak manages to establish that the client was framed; he walks
                  out of the courtroom a free man. Grace is defeated again! (But
                  will former lovers Michael and Grace get together again??) Stuart
                  and Anne are ripped off by their guru. Arnie discovers his wife
                  (from whom he is separated) in bed with another man and declares
                  war. He's going to fight the divorce to the bitter end, demand
                  all of the property, seek custody of the dogs (whom he detests).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Abby Perkins (who now has her
                  own law firm) emerges to represent Arnie's wife--and shows up
                  with eight forensic accountants to audit McKenzie, Brackman and
                  establish the value of Arnie's interest in the firm. Dave contacts
                  Roxanne and announces that he has cancer and has only a few weeks
                  left; can she shelter him in his last days? (Or is he still just
                  the old scam artist?) A new female associate is on the make for
                  Ann's client and Arnie's body. So there is an abundance of thematic
                  material in the reunion show. It is somewhat like Bartok's Concerto
                  for Orchestra--everybody gets to play a solo. <br>
                  So how come we have such fond memories for this TV show that
                  was really part law story, part soap opera? Watching the reunion
                  show brought back some of the reasons.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">First, <i>LA Law</i> opened
                  the way for the type of law shows on TV that we now take for
                  granted. Prior to <i>LA Law</i>, lawyers on TV were solo practitioners,
                  often in the painfully formulaic Perry Mason or Matlock mode.
                  Like <i>The Defenders</i> from the 1960's, none of the TV lawyers
                  ever appeared to care about money and none ever had an ethical
                  problem. <i>LA Law</i> was about law the way it's practiced today--in
                  firms, for dollars. Today, we want our TV lawyers to be realistic.
                  We know that the law is full of shadowy ethical conflicts without
                  simple answers, that the adversary system often conceals the
                  truth and produces injustice, that clients are not all innocent
                  or even decent people, and that practicing law is a tough and
                  very stressful way to make a living. Lawyers on TV (and in real
                  life) often wonder what they hell they are doing with their lives.
                  We would never have <i>The Practice</i> or <i>Law &amp; Order</i>
                  if <i>LA Law</i> had not gone first.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Second, <i>LA Law</i> did a
                  great job in probing the business v. profession conflict that
                  is at the root of the problems of law practice today. Is law
                  just another profit-making business--no different from selling
                  advertising or sweaters--or is it still a &quot;profession&quot;?
                  Should you extract every possible dollar from every client by
                  overbilling or charging $2 per page for sending or receiving
                  faxes? Or do the old ideas of professionalism still hold, such
                  as putting the client's interest before the lawyer's, maintaining
                  some independence from clients, or recognizing the obligation
                  to do pro bono work? This is the era of mega-firms, soaring associate
                  salaries, seven-figure profit shares, 2400 billable hours a year,
                  disappearing civility, and brutal competition among lawyers and
                  within law firms. In this Darwinian world, the business model
                  holds sway and the professional model has nearly collapsed. .</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">On <i>LA Law</i>, we saw the
                  business/profession battle being fought out within the partnership
                  every week. Brackman was always bottom line; all that counted
                  were billable hours, collecting fees, avoiding clients who couldn't
                  pay. Arnie Becker was always interested in pumping up the hours
                  and turning friendly divorces into lucrative vendettas. Before
                  her untimely demise, Rosalind Shays carried the profit incentive
                  to the max. On the other hand, McKenzie often stuck up for the
                  professional model, aided by Michael Kuzak and Ann Kelsey.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This old struggle played out
                  well in the reunion show. Kuzak wanted to represent his former
                  client in the death penalty hearing but he needed backup from
                  the firm. Brackman wouldn't hear of it. After all, Kuzak hasn't
                  worked there for years, the firm doesn't do criminal law (at
                  least not that kind of criminal law), and this client can't pay
                  a nickel. Kuzak goes to the retired McKenzie for support and
                  also gets enthusiastic backing from Markowitz and Brackman's
                  son. Well, folks, Douglas Brackman is the way law is practiced
                  today. It's pretty much all bottom line. Pro bono and all that
                  soft stuff is shoved aside.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Third, <i>LA Law</i> was the
                  first of the law shows to deal with the personal life of its
                  characters, as <i>The Practice</i> continues to do. <i>Perry
                  Mason</i> and <i>The Defenders</i> apparently had no lives outside
                  the office (<i>Law &amp; Order</i> maintains this tradition).
                  But the lawyers of <i>LA Law</i> were all too human. Just because
                  they were great lawyers did not make them great human beings
                  or give them good judgment about their lives. Indeed, their personal
                  lives were mostly a shambles. And so it is in real life too.
                  Many lawyers today have no time for a personal life, much less
                  a life-style, and don't know how to spend all that money (once
                  they've paid back their six-figure student loans). The rates
                  of alcoholism and drug abuse among lawyers are far higher than
                  in the general population.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the reunion show, we see
                  smart lawyers acting like personal idiots. Take a tax lawyer
                  like Stuart Markowitz--he'd watch out for a client's every nickel.
                  Yet Stuart and Ann give their guru the power to draw from their
                  checking account for his new building project! Arnie Becker,
                  who knows better than anyone how utterly destructive a nasty
                  divorce can be, decides that he's going to be as vindictive in
                  his own divorce as any of his clients ever were. Real lawyers
                  can be just as stupid and self-destructive in their personal
                  lives as the characters in this show.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So it was with nostalgic feelings
                  and guilty delight that this aging <i>LA Law</i> fan welcomed
                  his aging friends from McKenzie, Brackman back into his living
                  room. Who knows? Maybe we'll all see each again at the twentieth
                  reunion.</font></p>
