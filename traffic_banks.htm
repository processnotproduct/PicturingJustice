                  by Taunya Lovell Banks</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Traffic</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">, Stephen Soderbergh's Oscar nominated
                  film, is a disturbing blend of fiction and reality with a semi-documentary
                  feel. Structurally interesting, its multiple discrete plots occasionally
                  intersect in interesting and almost casual ways somewhat reminiscent
                  of the overlapping stories in Krzysztof Kieslowski's <i>Red</i>
                  (1994). Also interesting is the cinematography with its very
                  grainy, high contrast shaky video camera scenes of Mexico and
                  the shift to a sleeker crisper camera look for the United States
                  scenes. These camera tricks betray the film's rather imperialistic
                  perspective. Corrupt government officials only seem to live south
                  of the U.S. border.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/deltoro.jpg" width="197" height="131" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Billed as a realistic examination
                  of the drug problem, <i>Traffic</i> raises no new issues, and
                  provides no new insights or strategies. Perhaps, that is Soderbergh's
                  point. There is nothing new under the sun-the issue is old, and
                  the solutions are obvious. Midway through the film there is a
                  somewhat surreal scene of political party in Georgetown where
                  Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), the fictional federal &quot;Drug
                  Czar,&quot; gets advice on fighting the drug war from real-life
                  politicians. Fiction and reality blur as we see Wakefield talking
                  with Senators Barbara Boxer, Orrin G. Hatch, Charles Grassley,
                  Don Nickles and Harry Reid (III). They are joined by former Massachusetts
                  State Governor, Bill Weld. Are their comments or appearances
                  in the film intended as campaign ads? Even Jeff Podolsky, the
                  onetime arts and entertainment editor for George magazine, playing
                  himself, has an opinion on the subject. Was his appearance a
                  plug for the magazine? Sadly, these real-life people come off
                  as disingenuous distractions.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Just as quickly, the film shifts
                  back to full fictional mode as Wakefield, shocked (or &quot;awakened&quot;)
                  by the disclosure that his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen)
                  is using drugs, decides to tour &quot;the front line,&quot; the
                  border where he talks with federal and state officials. Some
                  critics called these scenes &quot;preachy,&quot; but the officials'
                  comments have a false ring. Wakefield and the public officials,
                  fake and real, seem to be mouthing some &quot;party line&quot;
                  that neither he (the actor/character) nor his conversationalists
                  really believe. The only question is what party, a question <i>Traffic</i>
                  never seems to answer.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer),
                  the ill-fated drug smuggler turned federal witness, says, the
                  United States government, and even the DEA agents, already know
                  that the war against drugs has been lost. The film audience is
                  left to wonder why. Are we losing the drug war because there
                  are so many layers between the really big guys and their market?
                  Is it because of the enormous amount of money generated by the
                  drug trade?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At one point early in the film
                  Monte Gordon (Don Cheadle), the African American DEA agent, tells
                  his partner, Ray Castro (Luis Guzman), that he wants to get to
                  the big guys - the white guys. But we never see the white guys
                  in the film. All the big wealthy dealers are Mexicanos or Mexican-Americans.
                  Perhaps that is an underlying message in <i>Traffic</i>, the
                  real powers behind the Mexican-American drug trade are totally
                  invisible and invincible.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Materialism seems to motivate
                  most of the characters. Even Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta?Jones),
                  wife of jailed drug kingpin Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), is transformed
                  from conventional young wealthy matron to a ruthless drug trafficker.
                  She does not wish to return to the poverty of her childhood and
                  will do anything, even contract a killing, to preserve her material
                  wealth. Initially unaware of her husband's real business, Helena
                  overcomes her revulsion quite quickly to take control of her
                  imprisoned husband's business.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The film even attributes economic
                  motivation to the small time African American dealers. Seth Abrahams
                  (Topher Grace), Caroline Wakefield's school mate and drug procurer,
                  tells Wakefield, that the drug traffic prospers in African American
                  communities because street corner dealers can make $500 in two
                  hours selling drugs to upper class whites like himself. This
                  is a hollow effort to relate to African Americans. What the audience
                  does not see is the grim life of these dealers, portrayed so
                  vividly in the television production of David Simon's and Edward
                  Burn's book, <i>The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City
                  Neighborhood</i>.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If <i>Traffic</i> is truly
                  a comprehensive story about the futility of drug war, Wakefield's
                  journey into a drug infested African American community in search
                  of his daughter is a missed opportunity to tell the story from
                  that community's perspective. Instead, Wakefield enters and leaves
                  the neighbor with the same blinders, his only concern is Caroline.
                  In <i>Traffic</i> Soderbergh's primary point is that drugs are
                  a problem in Middle America not just in African American or poor
                  neighborhoods.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The narrative perspective throughout
                  is definitely upper class mid western WASP. Caroline Wakefield
                  is an attractive and popular clean-cut looking blond high schooler.
                  Looks are deceiving, because this straight &quot;A&quot; private
                  school attending all-American girl is a hard-core druggie. Strangely,
                  she never gets that hard-core haggard drug addicted look, perhaps
                  she hasn't been addicted long enough. Caroline looks rosy and
                  even angelic when her father finds her strung out and prostituting
                  herself. Who is in denial in this film, Caroline's mother (Amy
                  Irving) or the director. Despite Caroline's escape from her first
                  bout with drug rehab, we are made to believe that she is recovering
                  with the help of her loving and supportive parents. Many members
                  of the viewing audience, mindful of the high relapse rates, may
                  not be convinced that there is at least one &quot;happy ending&quot;
                  in this otherwise dark film. Once Caroline's somewhat estranged
                  parents (and the family) are reconciled, everything will work
                  out fine-more denial? In this sense <i>Traffic</i> is a very
                  conventional film.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Perhaps the most complex character
                  in the film is Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro),
                  the Tijuana police officer. Most reviewers characterize him as
                  a honest, self-sacrificing, hard working, but poorly paid Mexican
                  law enforcement official. All he asks in return for information
                  about the Tijuana drug cartel is a lighted baseball field for
                  his community. But is the audience being deceived? The final
                  scenes of <i>Traffic</i> have Rodriguez riding to intercept a
                  plane load of drugs and approving of Salazar's demise are ambiguous.
                  Rodriguez seems to have moved from a lowly position to one of
                  some authority. An optimistic take is that Rodriguez really is
                  the honest hard-working Mexican counterpart of Monte Gordon.
                  Both persist in fighting what may be a hopeless war. They are
                  the little guys fighting the invisible giant.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Traffic</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> suggests that the drug war must be
                  fought at both the real top, as well as the real bottom-drug
                  users, not the false bottom of drug dealers. Rather than imprisoning
                  drug users, we need to remove the reasons to try drugs and provide
                  alternate activities and values. Perhaps that is Soderbergh's
                  real message.</font></p>
