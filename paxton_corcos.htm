                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Tom Paxton never wrote truer
                  words, and I realize that every time I see the announcements
                  for the new shows on U. S. television networks. The Fall 2003
                  season is absolutely in line with previous years. As the leaves
                  fall and footballs fly, get ready for these exciting (?) innovative
                  (!?) new programs, in which both attorneys and cops (including
                  FBI agents) become rehabilitated, either through their own efforts,
                  or through the desire of a nation under siege to find heroes
                  among us.<br>
<br>
                  From ABC comes a show about &quot;a recovering alcoholic&quot;
                  who leaves big time law practice for a store front office in
                  a strip mall. <i>Better Days</i> (originally called <i>The Flannerys</i>)
                  stars Jeffrey Nordling as the Irish American who turns his life
                  around, having seen the shallowness and amorality of corporate
                  law. This show was probably inspired by the success of CBS' <i>The
                  Guardian</i>, also about a lawyer who is redeemed, and farther
                  back, by the big screen <i>Regarding Henry</i>, with Harrison
                  Ford as the lawyer who has to lose his memory to regain his soul.
                  NB: Don't confuse this show with the failed pilot of the same
                  name (also from ABC) starring Jim Belushi as a laid off auto
                  worker.<br>
<br>
                  Also from ABC: The DA, starring Steven Weber as the attorney
                  of the title who solves the murder of an associate. Oh, goody:
                  a dead lawyer! <i>The Street Lawyer</i>, starring Hal Holbrook,
                  and based on the John Grisham novel, also makes its debut on
                  ABC. ABC also plans to offer us law-related shows such as <i>10-8</i>
                  (rookie cop drama/comedy), <i>Alaska</i> (state trooper solves
                  crimes), <i>Karen Sisco</i> (based on a character from the Jennifer
                  Lopez movie <i>Out of Sight</i>), <i>Lines of Duty</i> (FBI rookie
                  goes up against a mob boss); <i>The Partners</i> (female cops
                  go undercover), <i>Threat Matrix</i> (about the fight against
                  terrorism), in all of which lawyers are likely to make at least
                  token appearances. There's also something called <i>Then Came
                  Jones</i>, set in a brothel at the turn of the 20th century;
                  the legal profession will undoubtedly show up somewhere in that
                  series as well.<br>
<br>
                  CBS has on offer <i>Century City</i>, a futuristic law show with
                  Eric Schaeffer and Viola Davis. This promising show will investigate
                  how the legal system might change by 2053. Check out the <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/ShowMainServlet/showid-16990/">TV
                  Tome page</a>. CBS is also proposing a <i>JAG</i> spinoff with
                  Mark Harmon and the perennially popular (and underrated) David
                  McCallum (remember <i>The Man From U.N.C.L.E.</i>)? Law-related
                  shows include <i>Criminology 101</i>, about two students who
                  put what they learn in class to good use in crime-solving, <i>Expert
                  Witness</i> (about forensic pathologists: Calling Dr. Quincy!),
                  <i>The Law and Henry Lee</i>, starring Danny Glover as a P.I.
                  in San Francisco, <i>Street Boss</i>, another cop show, <i>The
                  Unsolved</i>, about a woman detective who handles cold cases,
                  and <i>Violent Crime</i>, about Boston policewomen handling just
                  what the title suggests.<br>
                   <br>
                  Fox plans to air <i>The Circuit</i>, premised on an examination
                  of court cases seen through the eyes of the jury. Like <i>Century
                  City</i>, this series at least suggests originality. Fox's law-related
                  shows include <i>The Break</i>, about a cop who moves to Hawaii
                  with his son, the futuristic <i>NYPD 2069</i>, about a cop who
                  was frozen and is now defrosted.<br>
<br>
                  Lifetime has bought three series featuring law enforcement: <i>Follow
                  the Leeds</i> (the &quot;leads&quot;, get it???!), starring Elizabeth
                  Densmore as a private investigator, and <i>Wild Card</i>, about
                  insurance investigators, and starring Joely Fisher (I hate to
                  think that her last name is &quot;Wild&quot; but it probably
                  is); and <i>1-800-Missing</i>, about a psychic who helps an FBI
                  agent solve crimes.<br>
<br>
                  NBC will schedule <i>EDNY</i>, about New York district attorneys,
                  with William Baldwin, Rob Lowe in <i>The Lyon's Den</i>, a law
                  firm drama (his name doesn't seem to be Lyon or Lyons so I'm
                  at a loss to understand the title, but see <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/ShowMainServlet/showid-16747/">TV
                  Tome's page</a>, and <i>Miss Match</i>, with Alicia Silverstone
                  (<i>Clueless</i>) as a lawyer who tries to find people their
                  true loves (Mis-match, get it?????!!!). Its law-related series
                  include <i>Casino Eye</i>, about casino security and starring
                  James Caan, <i>Future Tense</i> (another punningly titled program)
                  set in the &quot;near future&quot; and featuring high tech, <i>Gated
                  World</i>, with Phil Hendrie as a former cop who takes a job
                  as head of security at a gated community, <i>Homeland Security</i>,
                  with Tom Skerritt and others as fighters against terrorism, Rupert
                  Everett in <i>Mr. Ambassador</i> (maybe we'll see some international
                  law?), <i>The Real Deal</i>, about a governor and his staff,
                  and Whoopi Goldberg in an as-yet untitled show about a former
                  singer who indulges in crime.<br>
                   <br>
                  Law is peripheral to some other shows that frankly, look like
                  clones. In each, an individual or family actually has to go to
                  work when the head of the family gets arrested and convicted
                  of some dastardly deed. Check out Jenny McCarthy's proposed series
                  from ABC, (no title yet), and <i>Arrested Development</i> (from
                  Fox). Kevin Hart also has an ABC series ready, in which his family
                  loses its money, but it's not clear how that happens. The notion
                  of rich people getting their comeuppance seems quite popular
                  in a period in which we are enjoying stories about Ken Lay's
                  wife opening a resale shop. Psychic powers are still in vogue;
                  check out <i>True Calling</i> (Starring Eliza Dushku on Fox)
                  in which a woman discovers she can go back in time and prevent
                  tragedy (shades of <i>Early Edition</i>), <i>Wonder Falls</i>
                  (also Fox) in which a woman has visions, and Lifetime's <i>1-800-Missing</i>.
                  Of course, whether one can truly interfere with the course of
                  events, and whether free will exists, are deep philosophical
                  questions that I am not certain these shows will investigate
                  thoughtfully. For a helpful essay on the philosophical problems
                  associated with time travel (if you go back in time and kill
                  your grandfather will you exist?) see <a href="http://www.geocities.com/naran500/features/time_travel.html">geocities.com</a>
                  or the time travel essay in the <a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/t/timetravel.htm">Internet
                  Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>. <br>
<br>
                  UPN offers <i>The Edge</i>, about even more FBI agents and DEA
                  agents on the U. S. -Mexican border, Vegas Dick, about a former
                  crook recruited to work for a casino, and <i>Weapon X</i>, about
                  a National Security Agency operative who develops superpowers.
<br>
<br>
                  USA Network has ordered further development of three shows, a
                  Tom Berenger vehicle called <i>Peacemakers</i>, about law enforcement
                  in the Old West, <i>Thought Crimes</i>, which sounds like a <i>Minority
                  Report</i>-inspired series, and something called <i>Touching
                  Evil</i>, apparently based on a British television series, and
                  starring Peter Wingfield as a detective who develops psychic
                  powers (even better than <i>1-800-Missing</i>!)<br>
<br>
                  Finally, WB has <i>Chasing Alice</i>, in which a Scotland Yard
                  detective comes to New York to look for her missing sister, <i>Fearless</i>,
                  in which a girl is recruited to join the FBI, <i>MacGyver,</i>
                  an updating of the Richard Dean Anderson series, in which MacGyver's
                  nephew continues his uncle's work, <i>Other People's Business</i>,
                  about aimless L.A. types who decide to become private detectives,
                  and <i>Tarzan</i>, in which Tarzan comes to New York and meets
                  policewoman Jane. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/garytherat.jpg" width="114" height="202" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">But we don't have to wait for
                  one new comedy, <i>Gary the Rat</i>, starring the voice of Kelsey
                  Grammer. It debuted June 26, 2003 and features a Harvard Law
                  School educated Wall Street lawyer who is so underhanded that
                  he actually turns into a rat. It's not clear how, but it may
                  be through a lightning strike. At any rate, his managing partner
                  seems to take Gary's new verminous condition in stride, except
                  for gratuitous remarks about his tail and generally furry appearance.
                  Of course, the partner, Jackson Harrison, needs all the help
                  he can get. He's only head of the firm because of the tragic
                  death of everybody else in a highly improbable bus accident.
                  Indeed, in Gary's world everything is slightly askew; his nemeses
                  include a dim-witted exterminator whose cat keeps trying to keep
                  him from harm and the consequences of his own stupidity, a pizza
                  delivery guy who insists on making nasty remarks about the clientele
                  and still expects a tip, and his mother, whom we never see, but
                  who calls Gary regularly to complain about her treatment at the
                  nursing home in which she's confined. Gary is less than sympathetic,
                  usually assuring her that the straps that the nursing staff use
                  to restrain her are for her own good, and that he'll see her
                  when he's not busy. Gary's self-centered, uncaring attitude is
                  what makes him a good lawyer, says the show, and it's also what
                  makes him an excellent rat. He does have his good points-he helps
                  the boss's secretary ward off the unwanted attentions of another
                  lawyer, and gets revenge on the fellow as well. <i>Gary the Rat</i>
                  is amusing, and gets its digs in not only at lawyers, but at
                  psychiatrists and many other professionals. The animation is
                  less than stellar (not as good as that for <i>Stripperella</i>,
                  for example), but what sells this show is the writing, which
                  is subtle and well, different. As Gary himself would say, &quot;I
                  know about being different.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  As I look over this unpromising roster, having seen NONE of these
                  shows, here's my psychic prediction: some of these shows will
                  air once or not at all. I don't hold out much hope that most
                  of them will go past two or three episodes. The most original-sounding
                  among them, <i>Century City</i> and <i>The Circuit</i>, probably
                  have no chance at all. Most likely to succeed? The ones with
                  psychics in them, which will last a season or two, because they
                  make the viewing public feel good. The ensemble dramas, like
                  <i>Better Days</i>, will stand or fall on whether we like the
                  characters. Most of the others, like <i>The Street Lawyer</i>,
                  in spite of its stellar lead, will be out on the street in an
                  episode or two. <br>
