            Court remains shrouded in mystery, consistently refusing to even
            televise its oral arguments. As a result, after viewing regular
            doses of <i>The Court</i> and <i>First Justice</i>, many Americans
            may be more familiar with the fake Justices than the real Justices.

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Taunya Lovell Banks</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Barely one year after the United
                  States Supreme Court ended the 2000 presidential election controversy
                  in <i>Bush v. Gore</i>, there are two programs about the Supreme
                  Court on commercial television. The latest addition, <i>The Court</i>,
                  starring Sally Field as Justice Kate Nolan, comes from the producers
                  of the critically acclaimed <i>The West Wing</i>. ABC decided
                  to air <i>The Court</i> as a temporary replacement for its new
                  lawyer show, <i>Philly</i>. The network probably reasoned that
                  <i>The Court</i> was a natural for a slot already devoted to
                  law and lawyering. There was, however, very little law or lawyering
                  depicted in the first show.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-2" face="Verdana"><img src="images/court5.jpg" width="155" height="189" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"></font><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The opening episode, entitled, <i>Life
                  Sentence</i>, has double meaning, signifying both the life prison
                  term of Charlene Grissom (Cynthia Ettinger), a woman career criminal
                  whose case is before the Court, and the life term of Supreme
                  Court Justices. The first part of this episode uses the Court
                  appointment process to disclose aspects of Kate Nolan&#146;s
                  character. Nolan, a middle-aged state governor with a supportive
                  husband, is politically shrewd, yet impartial and ethical. Her
                  deft maneuvering through the appointment process suggests that
                  she will be the swing vote on an ideologically divided Supreme
                  Court. This fictionalized Court seems divided over the same hot-button
                  issues &#150; abortion, the death penalty and three-strike criminal
                  laws&#150; as the real Supreme Court.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Justice Nolan, who replaces
                  a woman Justice killed in an automobile accident, joins a Court
                  that reflects racial and gender diversity as well. There is a
                  black woman, Justice DeSett (Diahann Carroll), and a Hispanic
                  man, Justice Martinez (Miguel Sandoval); all that is missing
                  is an Asian-American Justice. As with the real Supreme Court,
                  however, white men dominate.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The story line for the first
                  episode seems to overflow with coincidences and storylines. The
                  writer, Carol Flint, who worked on shows like<i> ER, China Beach</i>
                  and <i>LA Law,</i> is capable of doing better writing. She seems
                  unclear about whether this is a show about the Supreme Court
                  or the news media&#146;s coverage of the Court. There is Harlan
                  Brandt (Craig Bierko), the lawyer-turned-investigative-reporter,
                  who seems intent on digging up dirt on Justice Nolan. Coincidentally,
                  Brandt was a student in a law school seminar taught by Justice
                  Nolan. He earned an &#147;A&#148; but Nolan told him that he
                  would never be a good lawyer. Brandt&#146;s role and motives
                  are unclear. Does he have a personal beef with Justice Nolan,
                  or does he simply represent those unsavory scandal mongers who
                  masquerade as news reporters?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the meantime, Brandt is
                  doing a feature portraying Justice Nolan as the mirror image
                  of Charlene Grissom, the career criminal. Once on the Court,
                  Grissom&#146;s life sentence is the first case for which Justice
                  Nolan must cast a vote &#150; more coincidences. The legal issue
                  raised by Grissom&#146;s case, the harshness of three-strikes
                  laws, only serves as a background for the personal stories of
                  the Justices and their law clerks. Unfortunately, <i>West Wing
                  </i>does a better job than <i>The Court</i> of interweaving its
                  many story lines in more credible fashion<i>. </i>Yet <i>The
                  Court</i> is a much more respectful depiction of the Supreme
                  Court than CBS&#146;s <i><a href="firstmonday_banks.htm">First
                  Monday</a></i>.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">All told, there are good and
                  bad aspects about <i>The Court</i>, as well as its less notable
                  competitor, <i>First Monday</i>. Both shows purport to give television
                  viewers insights about the United States Supreme Court and the
                  Justices. This is a good thing, given the general public&#146;s
                  lack of knowledge about the Court. Yet each show gives viewers
                  a distorted view that is not subject to correction, since the
                  real Supreme Court remains shrouded in mystery, consistently
                  refusing to even televise its oral arguments. As a result, after
                  viewing regular doses of <i>The Court</i> and <i>First Justice</i>,
                  many Americans may be more familiar with the fake Justices than
                  the real Justices. This would be a bad development.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Television, a constant presence
                  in many American households, increasingly tends to blur the distinctions
                  between reality and fiction. Unclear is whether public exposure
                  to only a fictionalized view of the Supreme Court will pose a
                  threat to this institution&#146;s reputation and prestige. On
                  the other hand, <i>The Court</i> and <i>First Monday</i> may
                  simply reflect an already alienated public&#146;s view of the
                  United States Supreme Court. Perhaps the Court, when it decided
                  <i>Bush v. Gore,</i> did more harm to its own reputation than
                  two television series can. Only time will tell.</font></p>
