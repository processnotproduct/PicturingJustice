                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Judge J. Howard Sundermann,
                  Jr.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The change in portrayal of
                  lawyers since the early 1970's from generally positive to generally
                  negative has been demonstrated by Professor Asimow (<i>Bad Lawyers
                  in the Movies</i>, 24 NOVA L.R. 533 (2000)). Judges have not
                  escaped the change to more negative depictions. But, unlike lawyers
                  in the pre-1970 era, judges in films were usually faceless people
                  sitting behind the bench who occasionally nodded sagely when
                  an attorney would ask to approach a witness or introduce a piece
                  of evidence. Attorney Lawrence Welch does a wonderful job as
                  the judge in <i>Anatomy of a Murder</i>, but he is not really
                  a part of the story. The judge in <i>Miracle on 34th Street</i>
                  plays a kindly bumbling character, but he is not central to the
                  main story line.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/judgment-nuremberg.jpg" width="128" height="230" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">An
                  exception to this, in my opinion, is the best film ever made
                  about judges, <i>Judgment at Nuremberg</i>. This film deals with
                  one of the later Nuremberg trials that had only American judges
                  presiding. It is particularly interesting because the defendants
                  are four German judges who presided over German courts during
                  the Nazi regime. Three of the defendants were considered Nazi
                  hacks, but one, played by Burt Lancaster, was a brilliant jurist
                  who detested Hitler but nonetheless went along with the regime
                  in power. Of course, there is overwhelming evidence of atrocities
                  and crimes against humanity presented against the defendants,
                  but the American judges are confronted with the theories of the
                  defense as well as a changing political situation in post-war
                  Europe. For instance, counsel for the defendants were enforcing
                  laws passed by the Nazis, who were the legitimate government
                  in power at the time, and argues that they they should not be
                  held responsible for enforcing these laws. The defendants also
                  claim that the public was better served by them staying at their
                  jobs as judges because they were able to mitigate the application
                  of the Nazi laws. If they had resigned, worse people would have
                  been put in their place. In addition to legal arguments, there
                  is outside pressure on the American judges to go easy on the
                  defendants, as America needs the help of the German people against
                  a growing Russian threat in the new cold war. The film intelligently
                  explores serious legal and moral questions about responsibility,
                  and how they weigh on the judges who must decide them. The final
                  opinion, delivered by Spencer Tracy as the presiding American
                  judge, is excellent.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There have been two major changes
                  in the treatment of judges in film since the 1970s. First, we
                  are now part of the main story line to a far greater degree,
                  if not the main character in the film. Second, unfortunately,
                  the changes have not been to our advantage, for the most part.
                  Judges often now seem to be portrayed as lazy, corrupt, biased
                  and arrogant. Of course there are some judges who are like this,
                  but not to the extent that the movies would suggest. In <i>Presumed
                  Innocent</i>, the judge plays a prominent role in the film and
                  his past corruption and sexual misconduct are an important part
                  of the case and the defense. In <i>Suspicion</i>, the judge himself
                  is actually the murderer in the trial that he is presiding over.
                  Perhaps the worst depiction is <i>And Justice for All</i>, a
                  major motion picture staring Al Pacino (not as a judge). Two
                  judges are main characters in the film. One is presented as suicidal
                  and crazy. The other is portrayed as uncaring, nasty, arrogant,
                  and guilty of rape in a concluding trial scene. They are the
                  only judges presented in the film.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The judge in <i>The Verdict</i>
                  is portrayed throughout the film as lazy and incompetent. For
                  reasons unexplained in the film, he is heavily biased against
                  the plaintiff both in pretrial rulings and during the trial itself.
                  Justice is done in spite of the judge.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/rainmaker.jpg" width="149" height="210" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Rainmaker</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> has two judges featured, on good and
                  one bad. We meet the bad one first; in court he is impatient
                  and rude. In a scene in his chambers, he is presented as being
                  in collusion with an insurance company lawyer to settle a case
                  for far less that its value. In choreographed trips to the bathroom,
                  the judge indicates that he will dismiss the suit and then the
                  lawyer offers a modest settlement. The second judge appears as
                  the trial judge who is aware of defense counsel tricks and gives
                  the plaintiff a prompt and fair trial.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">My choice for the funniest
                  legal film of all time, <i>My Cousin Vinny</i>, has a judge featured
                  who is a stickler for procedure and decorum. He is a foil for
                  the more &quot;relaxed&quot; style of the main character, the
                  defense lawyer. Even though the judge is sometimes harsh when
                  enforcing courtroom discipline and a little hard to live with,
                  the judge is presented as well versed in the law and interested
                  in giving fair trials to those in his court.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Placing judges into moral dilemmas
                  is a common device used in modern films. Sometimes the dilemma
                  is the primary plot of the film and sometimes it is a secondary
                  issue, although the resolution of the dilemma could change the
                  conclusion of the film. An example of a moral dilemma as a secondary
                  issues occurs in the film <i>Night Falls on Manhattan</i>. A
                  prosecutor, the main character, has made his reputation from
                  the trial and conviction of a brutal cop killer and drug dealer.
                  As it turns out, the arresting officer later discovers that the
                  arrest warrant used to enter the killer's premises to affect
                  his arrest had expired by one day. The prosecutor becomes aware
                  of this discrepancy. The officer tells the trial judge. The judge
                  knows that if he acknowledges the improper warrant, a vicious
                  killer will be released and a brave policeman will be in trouble.
                  The camera shows the judge at his desk, sitting across from the
                  policeman, writing a new warrant and dating it the day of the
                  arrest as he tells the prosecutor on the phone that there must
                  be some confusion, he remember very clearly making out the warrant
                  on the day of the arrest and the original warrant is right in
                  front of him. The judge is shown in the film as making a choice
                  of the lesser two evils, and I suspect the public would agree
                  with his choice.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In <i>Judge Horton and the
                  Scottsboro Boys</i>, the judge is the central character in the
                  film and he is shown dealing with the famous case where a group
                  of young black boys are falsely accused of raping two white women
                  in Alabama in the 1930's. It is widely believed in that community
                  that the defendants are guilty; Judge Horton probably shares
                  this belief as the trial begins. During the State's case, a doctor
                  gives medical testimony barely consistent with the theory of
                  rape. The prosecutor then tells the court that another doctor
                  examined the girls but his testimony would be substantially the
                  same as the first doctor, so he asks to excuse the second doctor
                  from testifying. With no objection from the defense, the court
                  grants the request. The second doctor approaches Judge Horton
                  in the hallway and asks to speak to him. After some reluctance,
                  Judge Horton agrees to speak with the doctor and they step into
                  the men's room to talk. The doctor explains that based on his
                  examination, there is no question in his mind that the girls
                  were not raped. Judge Horton tells the doctor that he must testify
                  to this at the trial, but the young doctor says he cannot so
                  testify. The doctor explains that he could never go back to his
                  practice or live in his hometown if he testified for the defense.
                  The doctor tells the judge that he will deny everything he just
                  said if he is forced to testify. This is Judge Horton's dilemma.
                  He can call the doctor to the stand, declare a mis-trial, or
                  proceed with the trial. Judge Horton chooses to proceed with
                  the trial without mentioning the incident, because he believes
                  that as the trial unfolds, the evidence against the defendant
                  will be so thoroughly discredited that the jury will acquit.
                  But when the jury comes back with a guilty verdict, the judge
                  is faced with a new dilemma. A motion for a new trial is filed.
                  Horton could easily overrule the motion on the ground the there
                  was conflicting testimony and the jury believed that of the State's
                  witnesses. Granting the motion would likely end his career and
                  ostracize him with many of his neighbors and friends. But the
                  judge grants the motion and orders a new trial. A new judge is
                  appointed, and he presides over the subsequent conviction with
                  a heavy hand, and Judge Horton is handily defeated in the next
                  election.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Michael Douglas plays a young
                  judge in <i>Star Chamber</i>. The judge has presided over a series
                  of difficult Fourth Amendment issues where, in following the
                  law, he must release defendants whose guilt seems apparent. When
                  one of the defendants is charged with the torture and murder
                  of another young boy after his release, the judge goes to see
                  his friend and mentor, an older judge, who has hinted at a solution
                  to these problems. The older judge tells the Douglas character
                  that many of the judges have shared in his frustration and have
                  come to the conclusion that the judges are the &quot;law,&quot;
                  and that they have an obligation to solve this conflict between
                  the law and justice. He explains that the judges have formed
                  a secret court to consider the cases where the law seems to have
                  perverted the system. This court hears the facts, renders a verdict,
                  and most importantly carries out sentences. Douglas is asked
                  to join. The next scene shows the judges meeting at night and
                  hearing a case where a guilty violent defendant had to be released
                  due to a procedural issue. The judges in turn vote guilty, including
                  Douglas, who has joined them. <br>
<br>
                  It appears there is no turning back from the judge's new role
                  in film as an important if not leading character. There is a
                  new television show in development where the United States Supreme
                  Court is the setting for a <i>West Wing</i> type drama with fictional
                  justices as the main characters.</font></p>
