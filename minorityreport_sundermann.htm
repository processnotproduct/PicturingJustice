                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Judge J. Howard Sundermann</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I went to <i>Minority Report</i>
                  with great anticipation. The film combines one of the greatest
                  directors of all time, Stephen Spielberg (<i>Indiana Jones, Close
                  Encounters, Schindler's List, Private Ryan</i>), with superstar
                  Tom Cruise. It is a science fiction film, which is one of my
                  favorite genres, and the film was uniformly given excellent reviews
                  all over the country. In his review, Roger Ebert said <i>Minority
                  Report</i> &quot;reminds us why we go to movies in the first
                  place.&quot; But I thought it was just OK, maybe a six on a scale
                  of ten. I would recommend it, it is certainly better than Spielberg's
                  <i>A.I.</i>, but I found it to be well below my expectations.
                  The set-up is good. About fifty years into the future, a way
                  has been found to predict murders ahead of time and the department
                  of pre-crime, headed by Cruise, finds and arrests the potential
                  murderer before the killing takes place. How the pre-crime department
                  knows about the murders in advance is an inherent fault in the
                  film. People called pre-cogs are somehow picking up the thoughts
                  of would-be murderers and these thoughts are fed into computers.
                  The pre-cogs seem to be lying in an indoor swimming pool twenty-four
                  hours a day with wires attached to their heads. The names that
                  identify a potential murder come rolling down a shute with the
                  name written on something like a pool ball. The pre-cogs are
                  100% accurate.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/minorityreport3.jpg" width="136" height="191" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Good
                  science fiction can make us look at the world in a new way, and
                  this story accomplishes that by bringing up some interesting
                  legal issues. Obviously, people are being arrested for crimes
                  that they have not yet committed but, according to the film,
                  are certain to commit. Can people be arrested who have not committed
                  a crime but who are certain to commit one? In the film, The District
                  of Columbia has been murder-free for six years and the program
                  is very popular. I suspect that a program like this, which has
                  accuracy near 100%, would be approved easily today. This question
                  is particularly relevant considering the current terrorist problem.
                  Also the pre-cogs are effectively slaves, devoting their lives
                  to predicting murders. In the film, the audience is never told
                  if the process is voluntary on their part or whether the pre-cogs
                  are taken by the State when they are found to have the needed
                  abilities. Would we be willing to take away the lives of a few
                  to save thousands? There is also the possibility that the accusation
                  of a crime could lead to a murder attempt that would otherwise
                  not have taken place.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Cruise himself has his name
                  given as a potential murderer and looks for the victim, whom
                  he would not have known but for the prediction. Spielberg had
                  the imagination and the funding to ask scientists and engineers
                  to predict some future devices that are employed in the film.
                  Many devices are voice-activated as on <i>Star Trek</i>. The
                  way cars move around is interesting, and when one goes into a
                  store, a computer conducts a retinal scan and you are addressed
                  personally and directed to what you might be interested in. Also,
                  small robotic spiders search a building for Cruise by performing
                  a retinal scan of everyone there. <br>
<br>
                  But to me, the failure is in the story itself. Cruise, after
                  being accused of a potential murder, becomes a man on the run,
                  a la Hitchcock. The chase scenes were disappointing and rather
                  pedestrian. A character from the justice department is for some
                  reason opposed to Cruise and the pre-crime program, so he is
                  seemingly introduced just so there can be a bad guy. But the
                  real bad guy turns out to be the director of the pre-crime department,
                  played by Max von Sydow, who is afraid that when the program
                  goes national he will lose control. My take on the film as a
                  reviewer is another minority report.</font></p>
