                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Capital punishment was abolished
                  in the United Kingdom in 1969, after a five year moratorium introduced
                  by the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. It is, in
                  the light of the Human Rights Act 1998 (<a href="#anchor">1</a>),
                  unlikely ever to be restored, except in time of war, actual or
                  imminent. There continue to be frequent calls for its revival,
                  most recently by Lord Stevens, former Chief Commissioner of the
                  Metropolitan [London] Police after the fatal shooting of WPC
                  Sharon Beshenivsky (<a href="#anchor">2</a>). There can be little
                  doubt that perhaps the majority of the population would welcome
                  the restoration of hanging.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The last executions in Britain
                  took place in 1964, although it remained until recently a horrid
                  anomaly that British judges in the Privy Council might be asked
                  to determine the final appeals of prisoners sentenced to death
                  in the West Indies. Watching <i>Pierrepoint</i> was not, therefore,
                  just a period piece, as I well recall some of the more notorious
                  executions. Since then, a number of trials, notably that of the
                  Birmingham Six, wrongly convicted of an IRA bombing, in which
                  19 people died and more than 180 were injured in city center
                  pubs, has shown that miscarriages of justice must give genuine
                  pause for thought before this ultimate and irretrievable penalty
                  is exacted.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Albert Pierrepoint became a
                  hangman in 1932 and he resigned in 1956, having completed over
                  400 executions (the film states more than 600). He was the twentieth
                  century's most prolific hangman. He followed his father and uncle
                  into the job. The film begins with his being instructed into
                  the methods. The prisoner is seated with his back to the door
                  through which the executioner comes. He stands up and the hangman
                  immediately pinions his arms and tells the prisoner, 'Follow
                  me'. He leads him to the execution chamber next door, where the
                  prisoner will see the rope but will be more shocked and surprised
                  than have time to be frightened. The hangman puts a white hood
                  over the prisoner's head, then the noose, while the assistant
                  pinions his legs. The hangman pulls the lever and the trap opens,
                  the prisoner plummeting through and breaking his neck instantaneously.
                  It takes seconds.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Over the following two decades
                  Albert executed hundreds of the condemned. It is like a conveyor
                  belt to death. We see only a few and, to be fair, none is specifically
                  gruesome, nor prurient, nor morbidly fascinating. It is all,
                  in the manner of other British films, such as <i>Vera Drake</i>,
                  rather understated. In that lies the power of this production.
                  Timothy Spall as Albert has a mask-like face and, somewhat pudgy,
                  in his three-piece suit, he looks like a civil servant. The ritual
                  is that the day before the execution, he opens the spy-hole in
                  the cell door to look at the prisoner inside. He assesses the
                  drop necessary to achieve a quick kill and turns to his assistant
                  with words such as, 'Six feet, three'. Then off they go for a
                  meal.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Not that Albert is entirely
                  equable in temperament: one night he explodes because the meal
                  provided is 'rabbit food', a salad, and he no stranger to thundering
                  orders to the warden to bring him and his assistant a hot meal
                  as the regulations require. 'I have work to do tomorrow'. He
                  rebukes his military assistant ferociously when executing war
                  criminals in Germany and, having hanged thirteen persons, he
                  is told that only twelve coffins are available. He sends the
                  man off to fetch a thirteenth as he will not tolerate the prisoner,
                  who has now paid his debt, being tipped into the grave without
                  a coffin.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It is hard to see what propels
                  Albert to follow in his family's footsteps. When first appointed
                  as assistant hangman his mother tells him not to bring the job
                  back home - one gathers that his father drank heavily. At the
                  first execution we see the hangman line up with his assistant,
                  Albert, and the prison governor and a small queue of witnesses,
                  about five in all. One, in uniform is presumably the Sheriff
                  or similar official. On this occasion the hangman loses his nerve
                  as he faces his victim. Albert has to seize the strap and pinion
                  the prisoner. He presses him from the condemned cell into the
                  execution chamber, ensuring it is done speedily to spare the
                  feelings of all concerned. He operates as a machine, unemotional
                  and supremely professional. He shows cool respect to the condemned:
                  they atone. After the execution, he becomes Albert again. It
                  is only then that he regains his humanity and individuality.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">How he copes, short of this
                  detached half-alive, manner, so that Spall's expressionless face
                  is a mere persona while he undertakes his awful task, is not
                  spelled out. We see the execution of a woman who, we are told,
                  had killed twice. The terrified prisoner mutters 'God help me'
                  but Albert is swift and when asked what were her last words,
                  he refuses to say, stating that this is between the condemned
                  and the executioner. He does not want to know what the prisoner
                  has done, does not judge them, ensures that they meet their ends
                  with speed, efficiency, and considerable humanity. He never spurns
                  those whom he kills. He is merely the minister of justice, acting
                  calmly and without passion to exact society's demands. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At one execution, the same
                  ritual having been performed as before, the prisoner who had
                  unsuccessfully tried to kill himself beforehand as he wanted
                  to die, rather than to cheat the gallows, literally runs to the
                  rope. Pierrepoint has to steady his enthusiasm but all is over
                  in seven and a half seconds. This earns him congratulations and
                  Albert is pleased with the speed and the precision of his work:
                  the vertebrae are cleanly snapped, no prisoner lingering on the
                  rope. His victims never struggle being, from that point of view,
                  perfect sacrifices to a bloodthirsty Nemesis. It is this legendary
                  efficiency that brings Albert to the attention of Field Marshal
                  Montgomery who wants him to execute a number of German war criminals,
                  beginning with the guards from Belsen.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Perhaps Albert's pride at being
                  chosen for his recognized skill is a little macabre but Montgomery
                  makes it plain that he wants the executions to proceed with neat
                  efficiency, not allowing the condemned to be slowly strangled
                  as happens with the practices of other countries carrying out
                  similar tasks. The first day, Albert hangs thirteen from Belsen,
                  including Irma Grese, the youngest woman he executed, two other
                  female guards (all hanged singly) and then the men in pairs.
                  Albert pulls the hood to cover their faces with an elegant flourish.
                  In all, Pierrepoint dispatched perhaps two hundred Nazi war criminals.
                  Throughout all he remains professional, looking each in the eye
                  but showing neither hatred nor delight in his work. It is achieved
                  to his exacting standards and as each prisoner plunges through
                  into the pit, the rope barely quivers. Death ensues instantaneously.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Albert never makes a song and
                  dance about his job. His wife (Juliet Stevenson) realizes the
                  nature of what he does from his frequent and coincidental absences
                  but also from the black book in which he keeps a simple record
                  of the prisoner's name, the place of confinement and, it seems
                  the time it has taken him to complete the job. When he returns
                  from Germany he is appalled to be door-stepped by the press and
                  to be lauded as an 'avenging angel' as well as being clapped
                  and cheered by the regulars in the pub he owns by then. All this
                  attention bothers him for he has seen his task as a private one,
                  dispassionately carried out, and one of which he should be neither
                  proud nor ashamed. It seems as if the sheer quantity of executions
                  in Germany has disrupted his equilibrium.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Later we see him execute Timothy
                  Evans for the murder of his wife and child and who dies protesting
                  his innocence. It shows the extent that luck plays in the choice
                  of one's flat mates or lodgers. Evans was unfortunate in being
                  closeted with the serial killer Christie of Rillington Place.
                  Had he been differently placed, like Charlie Falconer sharing
                  rooms with Tony Blair, he might have ended up as Lord Chancellor.
                  Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in England, smiles provocatively
                  at him as she stands on the trap door. She appears to welcome
                  death.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In each case, the same sad
                  ritual, the same drab rooms with their sweating green walls,
                  the dim lights, the tolling of the nine o'clock bell with the
                  execution party waiting for the last stroke before entering the
                  cell. One wonders if the prisoner, who must have heard the bell's
                  striking the hour, wondered for a moment if he had been forgotten,
                  his life no longer inexorably to end. Would they some how pass
                  him by? I recall a performance of Marlowe's Dr Faustus at Stratford-on-Avon
                  where Eric Porter turned hopefully as the midnight hours struck
                  and nothing happened. His terror turned to sickly hope as hell
                  did not gape for him. Suddenly, however, the entire back of the
                  stage crashed down as the devils rushed in to drag him off. It
                  might take twenty seconds or less to hang a man but that time
                  must expand into eons. As Shakespeare said in <i>As You Like
                  It</i>, </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This film avoids the macabre
                  fascination of dwelling on the details of violent death. It avoids
                  prurience (despite the undressing of the body of a middle-aged
                  female prisoner who, after an hour of hanging is washed and prepared
                  for autopsy and interment). It avoids violence in the almost
                  casual way that the execution are carried out as the living being
                  plunges out of sight into inert death: society demands the penalty
                  and, once exacted, the prisoner's corpse is entitled to respect.
                  American viewers might be surprised that the condemned go to
                  the gallows in their own clothes, not prison garb.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Albert might be expected to
                  suffered nightmares from looking into the eyes of those who are
                  in moments to meet certain death - not like shooting an enemy
                  in battle. This only happens once, when Albert is summoned to
                  execute one Corbitt (Eddie Marsan), and then discovers that the
                  condemned man is Tish, a friend and fellow singer from Albert's
                  pub, who had killed his ex-girlfriend in a fit of jealousy. Now
                  Albert, Tosh to Corbitt, must set aside the persona. They meet
                  as fellow human beings, but both accept that Albert does his
                  duty, saying only to his friend that all will be well. That night,
                  Albert drinks himself into an emotional stupor and flings away
                  his fee, later dreaming of his dead friend as a scarecrow that
                  falls into his arms.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As the execution trap clatters
                  open time and time again we sense the cheerless nature of society's
                  revenge. Albert finally resigns over the failure of the prison
                  authorities to reimburse him properly for attending to executions
                  where the prisoners are reprieved at the last moment. It gives
                  nothing away to say that this film ends undramatically on the
                  dignified letter that Albert types and then firmly signs. Then
                  we are bleakly informed of the number of hangings he has performed.
                  Then, with an uncomfortable truth, we are presented with a last
                  statement that tells us of Albert's own considered view that
                  capital punishment never achieved anything save revenge (<a href="#anchor">3</a>). Nobody could be better placed to offer
                  this stark reminder. The desire for revenge may be understandable.
                  It is not laudable. The cold-blooded removal of another human
                  being's life degrades the individuals and the society that authorizes
                  it. The secret shame that <i>Pierrepoint</i> portrays rightly
                  belongs to a doleful past.</font></p>

                  condemned to such penalty or executed'.<br>

                  <p><font size="-2" face="Verdana">'Lord Stevens said the &quot;cold-blooded&quot;
                  murder of Pc Beshenivsky had &quot;finally&quot; changed his
                  mind on the death penalty. <br>
                  &quot;Such an extreme act of pure evil can only be met by the
                  most extreme of responses - and that can only be death,&quot;
                  he told the News of the World. <br>
                  ...<br>
                  &quot;All my life I've been against the death penalty,&quot;
                  Lord Stevens said. <br>
                   &quot;I genuinely never thought I'd say this, but I am now convinced
                  that the monster who executed this young woman in cold blood
                  should, in turn, be killed as punishment for his crime. <br>
                  For the first time in my life, despite 40 years at the sharp
                  end of policing, I finally see no alternative.&quot;'</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-2" face="Verdana">Despite every sympathy for
                  Lord Stevens and the popular view that murder merits death, this
                  is the very circumstance when those in leading positions in our
                  society must hold firm. The prospect of being literally locked
                  away for life must remain a major deterrent, a living death.
                  There must be those like Timothy McVeigh and apparently, Zacarias
                  Moussaoui, the 9/11 terrorist who would prefer death to a lifetime
                  behind bars.</font></p>
