      Film</font><p>
      <p align="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><small>by James R. Elkins</small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000"><big><strong><big>&nbsp;&nbsp; W</big></strong></big>e
      are a society of lawyers . . . and lawyer films. Both lawyers and the films depicting them
      are worth watching. Both lawyers and lawyer films engage us in the serious business of
      legal culture and in the great social dramas of our time. Lawyer films also, not
      incidentally, provide entertainment and amusement. The staged, scripted, and often
      not-so-well acted antics of lawyers are well-known to &quot;courthouse regulars&quot; and
      fellow lawyers. Now, they are also known through popular culture lawyer films, through
      nightly television dramas which feature lawyers and through the legal thriller novel genre
      that has made John Grisham a household name.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; Swimming as we are in law and
      lawyers and their representation in film, I took up the teaching of a &quot;lawyers and
      film&quot; course to witness firsthand the encounters of those who have set out to be
      lawyers with the films in which their profession and work are portrayed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; One might expect those
      well-versed in the law and legal culture to have something important or valuable to say
      after having encountered themselves in film. And indeed, there is a growing cadre of law
      professors and legal studies teachers who take film seriously, write academic essays about
      lawyer films, and are exemplary film critics. But what of the law student, still
      struggling to master the basics, acquiring the skills, awaiting admission to the ranks of
      the profession? What happens when law students watch lawyer films?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it should be noted
      that students of law, and indeed, lawyers and law teachers, suffer from some rather
      serious failings as film critics. Their failing is two-fold: they bring both too little
      and too much to their efforts to read film. When the law-trained student or lawyer watches
      a film they are often trying to escape law rather than confront it. Consequently, when
      they watch lawyer films they assume that the film is for pleasure and not business. The
      law student tells me, &quot;I watch films for pleasure, indeed, I am taking your course on
      <em>Lawyers and Film</em>, Professor Elkins, simply because I love movies. I don't want to
      destroy that pleasure by subjecting every film I watch to heavy duty interpretation. I
      watch lawyer films for fun, for entertainment. I took this course to escape the relentless
      drumbeat in the traditional law school course, not to re-encounter it in a new
      guise.&quot; I call this the Pleasure Trap. For some viewers of lawyer films, the pleasure
      and entertainment associated with &quot;movies&quot; simply cannot be overcome -- they
      never learn how to &quot;read&quot; a lawyer film as a text worthy of study and critical
      engagement.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; The second obstacle, for
      those possessed of a legal mind and tempted by more social and political awareness, is the
      knowledge that the film has been produced by the Hollywood film industry, a West Coast
      money machine, another name for big business. Lawyer films are presented not only for the
      entertainment of a mass audience, but for the profits that the films create for the film
      producers and the film industry. The politically savvy student tells me, &quot;Lawyer
      films are a product of the Hollywood film industry and aren't intended as prescriptions on
      how to live or practice law. You have to remember these films are made for mass audiences
      and to generate big money.&quot; It's quite true that films are made for money, made by a
      culture industry, and that much of what we see has the Hollywood stamp prominently
      displayed on it. But like the &quot;pleasure trap,&quot; this notion that films are
      tainted as educational texts by the source of their production deserves critical scrutiny,
      but can be a serious obstacle to careful reading of lawyer films.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; There is still a third
      obstacle for the law-trained viewer of lawyer films -- the most serious and pernicious of
      all -- the &quot;insider knowledge&quot; trap. Law students and lawyers are trained to
      know something about law and legal procedures, about trials and how they are conducted.
      While &quot;insiders&quot; often assume they know more than they actually do, when
      watching lawyer films they know enough to focus on the &quot;legal accuracy&quot; of the
      film, the legal surface that hides whatever meaning the film might have. I ask the
      student, what do you see when you watch this film. She replies, &quot;The most obvious
      thing I notice about this film, and about TV shows involving lawyers, is how inaccurate
      they are. Lawyer movies don't come even close to reflecting the reality of trial
      litigation, and they are even worse when it comes to depictions of law and legal
      procedures. they are most inaccurate, in showing what lawyers actually do.&quot; The
      law-student-insider (and even the knowledgeable film critic) constantly complains and
      critiques lawyer films for legal inaccuracies and their unrealistic depiction of the legal
      profession. For these viewers, lawyer films are viewed as failed documentaries; it's the
      role of the &quot;insider&quot; to keep us informed on how sloppy and stupid it is to try
      to look for meaning in a Hollywood lawyer film. The film critic steps forth to offer a
      more informed and enlightened view of correct legal procedure; they argue that lawyer
      films must be legally realistic about law and lawyers before they can be taken seriously.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering these obstacles
      to critical engagement with a lawyer film, what is one to do? How can those who are
      law-trained get beyond the &quot;pleasure trap,&quot; the
      &quot;it-came-from-Hollywood&quot; trap, and the &quot;we-lawyers-know-the-law trap&quot;?
      If we can't get beyond these obstacles, lawyer films offer little more than amusement and
      entertainment. I argue there is more to lawyer films than meets the jaundiced eye. Might
      we not become better readers of film, insider and outsider alike, if we had better
      strategies for watching lawyer films? That strategy includes at least four things to
      remember:</font></p>
      <b><p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">A Film Tells a Story</font></b>. </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; We enjoy and take pleasure in
      films because they are carefully (if not always thoughtfully) crafted stories. Film
      stories are compact and are peopled with vivid (often unforgettable) characters,
      characters given to saying interesting things, living in and leaning against the work,
      habits, and culture of their situations and settings. We aren't likely to understand
      lawyer films unless we learn more about stories, and how they work, and how we are
      prepared and disabled in working with them.</font></p>
      <b><p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Stories Introduce Us to Conflict and
      Its Resolution</font></b>. <p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; If we could live free of
      conflict, tension and the great polarities, we'd have little reason for stories and the
      film industry would be as endangered as the small family farmer. Conflict is central to
      drama, drama to story, and story to life. Our lives are connected to lawyer films by the
      reverse path of story, drama, and conflict. To understand the stories in our lives and our
      films, we need a better understanding of conflict. Lawyer films play in and with the
      conflict and tension represented in the &quot;great opposites&quot;: good &amp; evil,
      order &amp; disorder, status quo &amp; progress, hate &amp; love, friendship &amp;
      betrayal. We need to know all we can about the tension between the forces that induce
      conflict both in our culture and in our own psyches. Lawyers are stuck working with
      conflict, making a living from it, and need more understanding of it than they sometimes
      have.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000"><b>The Care For Character</b>. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; The pleasure of film watching
      comes, in part, from our ability and human need to identify with others. The central
      characters of film are meant to be liked and disliked, to engage and to repel us. We find
      characters in film attractive because they face great trials (or smaller versions of the
      great ones) and do so in ways that are instructive and dramatically compelling. We
      identify with film characters because they have burdens to bear, threats to confront,
      obstacles to overcome -- they are asked to learn something about themselves and their
      worlds. We, too, are confronted with similar tasks and there is the hopeful notion
      (sometimes a false one) that by seeing the film character learn we, too, have learned
      something about ourselves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; There is something odd,
      peculiar and wonderful about the knowledge we come to possess about film characters. We
      know what the character looks like, often enough where she lives, what kind of furniture
      she has in her bedroom, the kind of car she drives, her marital and family situation,
      where she works, whom she works with, what kind of work she does, how she is regarded by
      her coworkers, her relationship with her boss, how the boss is regarded by the workers,
      and the various tensions and conflicts in her work. I know more about a film character
      than I do my fellow teachers who share the hallway of the law school where I teach.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; We learn enough about film
      characters, at least when portrayed in anything other than a one-dimensional fashion, to
      become involved in their lives. We begin to care about the film's characters, we want
      things to turn out well for a particular character (and less well for another), we want a
      character to get what he or she wants or needs or desires because of what we have learned
      about them and because we care. We want the characters with whom we identify to vanquish
      their foes (and slay the dragon). We want for film characters what we want for ourselves.</font></p>
      <b><p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">A Film is an Education</font></b>. </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; James Boyd White, a law
      professor who also teaches literature and the Greek classics, says, &quot;I read for an
      education. . . .&quot; [Milner S. Ball &amp; James Boyd White, A Conversation Between
      Milner Ball and James Boyd White, 8 Yale. J. L. &amp; Hum. 465, 476 (1996)]. We viewers of
      lawyer films might puzzle over the possibility that we watch a lawyer film for an
      education as well as for entertainment. If you want to be a better student of lawyer
      films, you might ask: What kind of education does this film make possible? What kind of
      knowledge of lawyers, the legal profession, and the world does the film offer? What view
      of the world and lawyers and law does this film make possible that is not found in the
      daily legal world I occupy as student of law or lawyer, or as a citizen who must deal with
      a culture so saturated by law?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; There are good reasons to be
      interested in lawyers and their work. Unlike the film viewer trapped in conventional
      responses to lawyer films, we might study these films as well-crafted dramas laden with
      meaning, offering views of the world, of law and of lawyers of benefit to even the most
      hardened insiders. The problem, of course, is that legal insiders are blinded by the
      previously discussed conventions that surround our engagement with &quot;movies&quot; and
      by the powerful defense mechanism that protects the insider's ego by focusing on legal
      accuracy and fidelity rather than meaning and critical perspective . We law-trained
      insiders have a need to be loved more than understood. With an ego invested in legal
      culture, and love hard to come by, we become notoriously poor readers of lawyer films.</font></p>

      &quot;Lawyers and Film&quot; course, I have searched the world of &quot;film theory&quot;
      and &quot;film studies&quot; for strategies on how to work with the ideas presented in
      this column. I have found little guidance in these sources. In contrast, I find that the
      more accessible, relevant, and useful source of ideas for teaching my students is the work
      of screenwriters and screen-writing consultants. Screen-writing people know that films are
      stories and are better prepared and willing to talk about stories than are film theorists.
      (Film studies, still securing its place in the world of academia, follows the theorists
      rather than those devoted to stories.) I recommend: Robert McKee, Story: Substance,
