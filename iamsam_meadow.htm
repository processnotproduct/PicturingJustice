                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I Am Sam</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is a touching, ultimately uplifting
                  and beautifully crafted movie (especially for those of us relationship-junkies
                  who love the Zwick-Herskowitz oeuvre (producers of <i>Thirty
                  Something</i> and <i>Once and Again</i>, among other things).
                  But, for this reviewer it was a powerful reminder of why I stopped
                  being a trial lawyer. Some issues are just not meant for binary,
                  polarized decision-making produced by contentious, soul-killing
                  (&quot;I always win,&quot; says a chillingly sinister, but smiling,
                  Michelle Pfeiffer) cross-examinations. I don't want to spoil
                  the ending as cruel reviewers do, but this film does a wonderful
                  job of illustrating what can happen when the &quot;baby&quot;
                  isn't split by the court. Literally.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/iamsam.jpg" width="177" height="118" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><i>I Am Sam</i> is the story of
                  Sam Dawson, brilliantly and gently acted by usually tough-guy
                  Sean Penn, who is &quot;mentally challenged&quot; so that his
                  seven-year-old daughter (named Lucy Diamond, yes for the Beatles'
                  song of the same name) is about to surpass his mental capacity
                  when the State enters. The movie is mostly about Sam's struggle
                  to retain custody of his gifted, beautiful, and precocious daughter
                  when the well-meaning social services actors decide he cannot
                  possibly parent a child whose intelligence is about to exceed
                  his own. But, as the Beatles' song says, &quot;All you need is
                  love,&quot; and Sam has plenty of that. Not only in his own soul
                  and heart but in the wonderful support group around him, his
                  also mentally challenged friends, Ifty, Robert, Brad and Joe,
                  each &quot;challenged&quot; in their own special and very human
                  ways, and his agoraphobic neighbor, Annie, played artfully by
                  Diane Wiest (she is indeed a sensitive artist - pianist and music
                  maker, who echoes in her being the healing powers of music).
                  New renditions of Beatles' songs play evocatively throughout
                  the movie, tearing at the heartstrings of potential audiences
                  of both fifty-somethings and probably their kids as well.<br>
<br>
                  The lawyers are well depicted in this film. Michelle Pfeiffer
                  explodes with the tension of a wound-up-too-busy- for-her-own-child-and-marriage,
                  high-priced and successful lawyer. Sam picks her out of the phone
                  book because her firm has many names in it but in the end the
                  client serves the lawyer better than she serves him. The County
                  attorney, Turner, played by <i>West Wing</i>'s Richard Schiff,
                  will appear to many to be the &quot;bad guy&quot; trying to take
                  Lucy away from her father, but in truth, he is doing his job
                  (I know, I did these cases as a parents' attorney for many years
                  in the early part of my own career) to protect &quot;the best
                  interests of the child,&quot; even if that means roughing up
                  witnesses with cross-examinations that delve into their own troubled
                  pasts. (In this case, sweet Annie's past pain is exposed on the
                  stand.)<br>
<br>
                  It wasn't only Annie's cross-examination that got to me. What
                  is well crafted in this film is the demonstration of how crude
                  a device is the modern trial, not only for ascertaining the &quot;truth,&quot;
                  whatever that is in a case like this, but how adversarial procedures,
                  attempts at dichotomous fact-finding and judicial resolution
                  of some human and painful dilemmas just don't belong in court.
                  Michelle Pfeiffer's lawyer character, Rita Harrison, can't trust
                  Sam's friends to take the stand, their mental &quot;challenges&quot;
                  making them too unstable and not &quot;normal&quot; enough to
                  vouch for Sam's quality of care for his child. Though Sam is
                  well rehearsed (too well rehearsed, as you will learn) it is
                  his mental challenges, his unique forms of human articulation
                  and his failure to grasp and enact the &quot;manipulated&quot;
                  truth of witness testifying that caused both my heart and brain
                  to arrest with the painful recognition that this is simply a
                  primitive method for making some very important decisions. Though
                  Sam is &quot;challenged,&quot; his testimony points out that
                  rehearsed, structured, manipulated and &quot;planned&quot; testimony
                  is not only ethically challenged, it is false and wrong to make
                  some (I am not saying all) important legal decisions this way.
                  Despite my own years of preparing parents, experts and other
                  witnesses to testify in these kinds of cases, I never liked it
                  and Sam's story made vivid the reason why. While I don't mean
                  to diminish the human difficulty of the decision that must be
                  made here- who can parent this wonderful child who needs homework
                  guidance, a regular schedule and a flexible guardian through
                  the complications of childhood and then opposite-gender adolescence?-it
                  becomes clearer and clearer that while love may not be &quot;all
                  you need,&quot; courts and trials are not the way to figure out
                  what you do need and foster care, guardianship and parental authority
                  are not the only ways to structure a parent-child relationship.<br>
<br>
                  Perhaps I am such a willing audience for the Zwick-Herskowitz
                  (and kudos to writer and director Jessie Nelson) sensibility,
                  wrapped up in Beatles' music because there was a time when some
                  of us forty, fifty or sixty somethings from the Beatles' period
                  did believe that new forms of family life and new forms of decision
                  making and legal justice might be possible in this world. Laura
                  Dern's kind foster mother character, Randy, ultimately teaches
                  us what is &quot;best for the child&quot; is not a court decision
                  with baby-splitting custody justice but a world of many vibrant
                  colors, with many different kinds of parents, friends and relationships.
                  Michelle Pfeiffer's Rita Harrison, Laura Dern's Randy and Sam,
                  who we the audience learn in the end is wiser than many in this
                  film, show us not only that it &quot;takes a village&quot; to
                  raise a child, but that the moots and mediation processes of
                  those &quot;primitive&quot; villages have a lot to tell us &quot;legally
                  challenged&quot; lawyers who cleave to our own forms of rough
                  and cruel courtroom justice.</font></p>
