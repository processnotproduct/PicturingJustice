                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Kenneth Wagner</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The film <i>Walking Tall</i>,
                  starring former professional wrestler Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot;
                  Johnson and former <i>Jackass</i> star Johnny Knoxville may seem
                  like a strange film to find discussed in a legal journal.  However,
                  this film aptly displays the hope that the jury trial system
                  holds out for citizens today.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The practice of trial by jury
                  is indeed an old one.  Article 39 of the Magna Carta, one of
                  the foundational documents in the legal system of English speaking
                  nations around the world, reads as follows:</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">No free man shall be arrested,
                  or imprisoned, or deprived of his property, or outlawed, or exiled,
                  or in any way destroyed, nor shall we go against him or send
                  against him, unless by legal judgment of his peers, or by the
                  law of the land.</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/walkingtall.jpg" width="150" height="216" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">This
                  practice of limiting the government's ability to take action
                  against its citizens unless a panel of such citizen's passes
                  off on the action has been a feature of our nation's legal system
                  its inception.  Indeed, references to the right of citizens to
                  a jury trial can be found in the Constitution in Article III,
                  Section 2 and in two of the 10 Amendments of the Bill of Rights
                  (the Sixth and Seventh).  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This historical precedent does
                  not, however, make the use of juries uncontroversial.  Many legal
                  scholars have critiqued the practice of placing justice in the
                  hands of untrained laymen often seem highly susceptible to emotional
                  and irrational appeals.  The Common Law tradition of keeping
                  juries 'virginal' or untainted by improper evidence and arguments
                  is the basis of much of the rules of our legal procedure. This
                  idea of empowering an uninformed group of non-experts in such
                  weighty matters was perhaps best skewered by Mark Twain when
                  he said: &quot;We have a criminal jury system which is superior
                  to any in the world; and its efficiency is only marred by the
                  difficulty of finding twelve men every day who don't know anything
                  and can't read. &quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I cannot help but disagree.
                   The historical veneration of the jury system is not without
                  a solid basis. Time and time again, from the case of Shaftsbury
                  in England to the Zenger case in colonial America, juries have
                  sympathized with citizens that were the subject of intolerable
                  government abuses of power and prosecution.  This history and
                  remaining potential is born out by the film <i>Walking Tall</i>.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Rock stars as Chris Vaughan,
                  who arrives home from military service to rural Kitsap County,
                  Washington.  He finds that the idyllic small town he grew up
                  in has changed in his absence, notably due to the influence of
                  the addition of a casino (which itself demonstrates the legal
                  concept of 'negative secondary effects' often purported to such
                  establishments).  The wealthy, immoral casino owner has the law
                  enforcement establishment on his payroll, and when Vaughan clashes
                  with the casino the sheriff, prosecutor, judge and public offender
                  all conspire to railroad the popular hero.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In &quot;real life&quot; as
                  in &quot;reel life&quot; this kind of corrupt conspiracy has
                  been exposed in history all too often.  What is a defendant to
                  do when all the usual 'courtroom actors' are determined to inflict
                  injustice on him?  That is where the jury comes in, both in legal
                  theory and in the film.  The hero represents himself (demonstrating
                  the importance of the right (upheld in the landmark case Faretta
                  v. California 422 U.S. 806 (1975)) and addresses his plea directly
                  to the jury.  This works: the promise of the right to jury trial
                  is demonstrated when the jury, despite the contrivances of the
                  courtroom work-group, acquits Vaughan.  It is from here that
                  Vaughan becomes the new sheriff of the town and ultimately cleans
                  up the town.  We need not buy the subsequent explosions and machine
                  gunning of the sheriff's office to recognize the important lesson
                  that Vaughan's acquittal by a jury of his peers teaches.</font></p>
