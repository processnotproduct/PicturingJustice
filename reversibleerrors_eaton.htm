                  and cannot suffer anything that is inconvenient.&quot;</i></font></p>

                  51 B.C.) <br>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Reversible Errors</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">, a successful CBS mini-series, is
                  the latest legal thriller from international legend Scott Turow
                  (still practicing pro bono in Chicago). He was a consultant during
                  its production and witness to the hard work it took to bring
                  his Kindle County residents to life. It retains the mystery and
                  a tip of the hat (&quot;The Law Offices of Marta Stern&quot;)
                  to its predecessor, <i>Presumed Innocent</i>. We want more! Soon
                  to be released in DVD, it is worth a second look just to figure
                  things out. Both <i>Errors</i> and Turow are quickly traversing
                  from legal metaphor to legal maxim. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/reversible errors.jpg" width="150" height="209" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Director Mike Robe
                  refreshes the plot with straight angles of few good deeds and
                  off-angles of frequent misdeeds, which allows the audience extra
                  time to ponder its complications. The hyped previews and long
<br>
                  commercials make the movie hard to follow. The fabulously intense
                  soundtrack and dialogue constantly compete against each other.
                  Written by Rob Roy's Alan Sharp, the script reflects a standard
                  nature, less compelling, than that of the book, but by focusing
                  on the main relationships, the impact of the death penalty process
                  is more intelligible. <br>
<br>
                  As an updated film noir, <i>Errors</i> is further refined with
                  easily recognizable actors imitating easily recognizable characters.
                  These personalities in crisis, set in uncomfortable surroundings,
                  are enough to make you squirm without the usual genre devices
                  of quick edits, murders, violence, or car chases. Its one chase
                  scene is on foot. The four bullets fired are from one man with
                  a stolen gun. Sex is as distracting for the audience as it is
                  for the characters. But it's their intentions that come across
                  as nasty.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The taedium vitae of ex-prosecutor
                  Arthur Raven (William H. Macy as Perry Mason on valium) is subdued
                  and renewed by enebriated Judge Gillian Sullivan(Felicity Huffman
                  as Olivia De Havilland gone bad). Blindly ambitious prosecutor
                  Muriel Wynn (Monica Potter as an emotionless Kate Capshaw) and
                  Larry Starczek (Tom Selleck as Bogie with a moustache) also pair
                  up professionally and personally. What they know and when they
                  know it becomes a private war in the cause of death penalty convict
                  Romeo &quot;Squirrel&quot; Gandolph(Glen Plummer as a dumbed
                  down Chris Rock).<br>
<br>
                  The infamous pairing of airport security chief Erno Erdai (James
                  Rebhorn as a violent J.R. Ewing) and his &quot;kin,&quot; druggie
                  nephew Collins &quot;Faro&quot; Farwell (Shemar Moore as an angry
                  young Morgan Freeman), merely plant the seeds of corruption.
                  Starczek allows Muriel to accompany him to the crime scene, and
                  she is assigned to her first big case. Louisa's best friend and
                  Erdai lie to Starczek in the initial investigation. Erdai's nephew
                  Farwell frames Squirrel for Erdai's murders by describing photos
                  of Louisa's babies in a cameo necklace Squirrel had. <br>
<br>
                  Both the deal and case hold up when Starczek retrieves the cameo
                  from Squirrel's arresting officer despite his having ditched
                  the photos. Starczek's murder theory is foisted upon Squirrel
                  as a voluntary confession. Judge Sullivan hears his case at a
                  bench trial. His conviction puts Muriel's career on a fastrack
                  to be the next P.A. of Kindle County.<br>
<br>
                  Seven years later, ex-judge Sullivan has served six years for
                  bribery <br>
                  and is out of jail. State-appointed to Squirrel's final appeal,
                  &quot;pro bono prince&quot; Raven gets the case reopened through
                  Sullivan from a letter written by the dying, jailed Erdai. Judge
                  Kenton Harlow decides to hear the case. This jeopardizes Muriel's
                  political campaign for P.A. Erdai dies of cancer not telling
                  the whole truth, and has hired an attorney to protect his nephew.
<br>
<br>
                  Erdai was convicted for shooting, and almost killing Faro. Faro
                  had dug up the gun and was threatening to tell everyone about
                  the murders. Starczek has the gun fingerprinted and discovers
                  Faro is Farwell and Good Gus owned the gun. To protect Muriel,
                  he wipes the bullet casings with Gus's prints clean, and destroys
                  the print card. This exculpatory evidence confessed to Muriel
                  goes no further. Sullivan's past addiction and rehab is implied
                  but she never reveals this to Raven.<br>
<br>
                  He and Judge Harlow fail to convince Mureil to allow Farwell
                  to testify in open court &quot;I have to content myself with
                  the law correctly applied, your Honor...the right to grant immunity
                  is mine alone...morals are matters for conscience...,&quot; she
                  says. Farwell is given immunity before a grand jury, which is
                  adjourned, allowing him to free his conscience in his attorney's
                  office before Muriel and Starczek off the record. Squirrel is
                  innocent. <br>
<br>
                  Ex-Judge Sullivan takes the fall for being a heroin addict during
                  Squirrel's trial. He is released due to &quot;reversible error.&quot;
                  The careers of Muriel and Starczek are saved. Raven wins, quits
                  his firm, and follows Sullivan to New Jersey. The many other
                  errors committed here are ignored. Anything less would have been
                  &quot;inconvenient.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">OF LEGAL SYSTEM INTERESTS</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Reversible Errors</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> scans the gamut of professional ethics
                  to complete, albeit, debatable conclusions. The trial proceedings
                  and prison scenes dispassionately connect a hidden culture that
                  lives above the laws they are bound to enforce, greedily fueled
                  by social climbing, bribery, and drug addiction. This thriller
                  is a microcosm of art imitating life upon newly created inroads
                  of corruption that breach equal justice from inside the legal
                  system. A lot can be learned from it: their circumstances and
                  after-thoughts grow into self-absorbed futures of the past due,
                  looming consequences each character wants so desperately to escape
                  from, but cannot. Each must ultimately face up to their regrettable
                  lies, but they get away with most of them. In real life legally
                  allowable lies appear to create more corruption against the public
                  good. <br>
<br>
                  This begs the question: Where does the public interest, pardon
                  the pun, lie? Real life supplies much less given information
                  and less secure decision-making. The tendency to convict people
                  such as Squirrel as scapegoats, sacrifices to a system that cannot
                  either find or has to immunize the guilty party. Oh, you can
                  argue that the system worked because Squirrel was in fact exonerated.
                  That argument is lame because Erdai and Farwell were never charged
                  to cover up prosecutorial misconduct. In real life Squirrel would
                  be dead, and a limited apology after this fact would take care
                  of the loose ends (eg: he was innocent). To make continual excuses
                  to retain such a flawed, unevenly applied process appears to
                  directly violate fairness and the 8th Amendment. This politically
                  expensive legal process is not the &quot;perfection of reason.&quot;
<br>
<br>
                  Consider our present chaos and both its sources and results.
                  Our legal system has fragmented and malfunctioned contrary to
                  purpose. The foundation of &quot;you are innocent until proven
                  guilty&quot; doesn't work anymore. The Law used to be the centralization
                  of our society, and computers have hastened both the speed and
                  bulk of cases at these uneven paces. The courts have not caught
                  up to the inclusive capacity or potential from technology, presenting
                  painful delays, legally delimiting accessibility (because of
                  unchanged laws), closing markets and venues traditionally open
                  to serve the public good. Hence it is more &quot;convenient&quot;
                  not to act than to provide justice. There appears to be more
                  dismissed and denied cases&#133;and a proliferation of private
                  law cases dividing our legal system into more segments. With
                  the incorporation of the profit motive into public service, streamlining
                  has come at the expense of individual rights. <br>
<br>
                  Adversarial manipulation of rumors and gossip into legal facts
                  becomes a disclaimer for truth and a scandal-mongering eagerness
                  to convict. The death penalty process does not deter, instead
                  it demoralizes and takes away years of life from all its participants;
                  this helps undermine the credibility and authority of our legal
                  system. It is a weapon as unwieldy as nuclear armaments. We have
                  not learned our limitations from history.<br>
<br>
                  PROBLEMS RESOLVE WITH TIMELY CHANGE<br>
<br>
                  Legal lies have proliferated over decades, and have finally permeated
                  entire legal system, elite inclusiveness causing the exclusion
                  of the populace it was designed to serve, only symbolized by,
                  the War on Terror. It is our beleaguered system that has left
                  us unsafe. We are insecure from within. We must change and adapt
                  our laws to restore security, both physically and economically.
                  These are just some signs there are many symptoms (unresolved
                  crises) that reveal we are not a super power anymore. <br>
<br>
                  The conviction of Martha Stewart is one. She was convicted because
                  she wouldn't sell out a friend. Her prosecutors wanted &quot;to
                  make an example of her.&quot; They picked on a self-made celebrity
                  from a law that says if you claim innocence you are automatically
                  guilty. Other Enrons out there have been ignored. The prosecution
                  hasn't the capacity to prosecute them all. They rely on an honor
                  system to self-regulate what never worked, and thus has been
                  worked around by elites to keep out newcomers, when laws should
                  have been modified for inclusiveness.<br>
<br>
                  In and out of election seasons, both Republicans and Democrats
                  have let us down. Neither has lived up to their promises, except
                  to use any means to gain political control. The majority is not
                  thrilled about their choices and tends to vote against a candidate,
                  not for s/he. Voters haven't turned out in numbers large enough
                  for a mandate to govern in decades, though the spin is otherwise.
                  As a Reagan Democrat, I have utilized write-in options. It frees
                  up the party spin that a vote not for their candidate is a vote
                  against them and America.<br>
<br>
                  Even vigilant stewards of our legal system have faltered. Known
                  bad data and info, used anyway, is used for &quot;convenience.&quot;
                  Lies causing this proliferation of corruption are tolerated.
                  The adamant refusal to reverse, correct, and/or change errors,
                  even if the law provides for it, may be the undoing of democracy.<br>
<br>
                  Wrangling delays of reform, and the unheeded festering of undone
                  wrongs, have proliferated corruption in both our government and
                  private sectors, to the disfavor our collective public interests,
                  in forced conformity, via detrimental routinization. Bureaucracy
                  must first change by reforming open access to digitally accommodate
                  jurisprudence in our courts. Mr. Chief Justice Rhenquist, and
                  all y'all Honors of the US Supreme Court, tear down this wall
                  of red tape that divides our legal system and restore &quot;equal
                  justice under law.&quot; <br>
