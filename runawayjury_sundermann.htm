                  Judge J. Howard Sundermann</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This is another John Grisham
                  book adapted to the screen. It is a combination of courtroom
                  drama, espionage thriller and heist film. The heist is of the
                  jury. The film opens with what has become all too common today,
                  an office massacre where a number of people are killed. This
                  scene is done well as we experience the fear and helplessness
                  of those in the office, but the audience is spared the visual
                  violence. A widow of one of the victims sues the gun company
                  who manufactured the weapon used by the killer. She hires Wendell
                  Rohr, an anti-gun lawyer, played by Dustin Hoffman. The industry
                  used in the book as the &quot;bad guy&quot; is the cigarette
                  industry and I'm not sure why the industry was changed to guns
                  in the movie. The lawyer for the defendant is almost irrelevant,
                  as the super jury consultant, Rankin Fitch (played terrifically
                  by Gene Hackman) is really running the defense team. The political
                  viewpoint of the film is clearly anti-gun. The executives of
                  the gun companies are portrayed as cartoon characters that could
                  care less about anything but protecting their industry and are
                  willing to win at all costs. This is why they hired Hackman,
                  who has never lost a case. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/runawayjury.jpg" width="184" height="122" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Part of the fun of the film is
                  watching Hackman in his control room with the computers and large
                  screens from where he is seemingly able to see everything. You
                  aren't sure if he is picking a jury or running Gulf War II. He
                  has a full history on each potential juror along with his or
                  her vulnerable points. Two important considerations, that could
                  be credited to artistic license; are left out of the movie: (1)
                  the cost and legality of all of this is not determined, and (2)
                  the amount of time it takes to obtain all of the jury information
                  is not addressed. Hackman's character is a control freak running
                  everything and tells his clients, &quot;Trials are too important
                  to be left to juries.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  Unknown to either side, as the trial starts, one of the jurors,
                  played by John Cusack, and his girlfriend have their own scam.
                  Cusack claims he can swing the jury either way and his girlfriend
                  contacts both the plaintiff and defense to tell them that the
                  jury can go their way for ten million dollars. In some good scenes,
                  Cusack and the girlfriend demonstrate their control of the jury.
                  This film, unlike most legal films, does show scenes inside the
                  jury room, and only <i>Twelve Angry Men</i> has more jury scenes.
                  Again a little artistic license is taken, as it never becomes
                  clear how Cusack got on the jury (he is not even from the city
                  of the trial) or how he can swing the jury the way he wants.<br>
<br>
                  There is a great scene in the courthouse men's room when Hackman
                  and Hoffman actually meet for the first time. It is the idealist
                  character v. the total agnostic character. But, even Hoffman's
                  character is not pristine pure. For a while Hoffman actually
                  considers paying the ten million, reasoning that this would be
                  better than losing this important case for gun control. The final
                  explanation at the end is a little weak, and there are some holes
                  in the plot that I pointed out, but it is good filmmaking and
                  I recommend it. <br>
