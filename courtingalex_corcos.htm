                  CBS' <i>Courting Alex</i></font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Christine Alice Corcos</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After watching <i>Close to
                  Home</i>, I didn't have much hope for CBS' other attorney show,
                  <i>Courting Alex</i>, which debuted in January as a possible
                  replacement for <i>Out of Practice</i>, a medicomedy starring
                  Stockard Channing and Henry Winkler, two gifted actors who do
                  not, in my humble opinion, get nearly enough tv exposure. And
                  they certainly don't get it in this tired vehicle, but it's getting
                  better, so I'm happy to hear that it is coming back on Wednesday
                  nights.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/courtingalex.jpg" width="132" height="91" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">First, in the interests of full
                  disclosure, I must admit that actress Jenna Elfman's charm eludes
                  me. I watched <i>Dharma &amp; Greg</i> in reruns and what I liked
                  best about the show was not Elfman's wacky Dharma or Thomas Gibson's
                  uptight attorney Greg, but the supporting cast, the talented
                  Susan Sullivan and Mitchell Ryan as her upscale in-laws, and
                  Alan Rachins, an alumnus of <i>L. A. Law</i>, and Mimi Kennedy
                  as her holdover hippie parents. These old hands did so much with
                  so little. Otherwise the show began with a slight premise (&quot;opposites
                  attract&quot; couple marries on a whim and spends time discovering
                  each other in lieu of filing for divorce) and had nowhere to
                  go.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Courting Alex</i> is more of the same. This time out, Elfman
                  plays the &quot;Greg&quot; character. She is the straight-laced
                  attorney, addicted to work, and unable to commit to a personal
                  life, whom her father, founding partner Bill Rose (played by
                  the great Dabney Coleman, doing a riff on his &quot;Nelson Fox&quot;
                  character in <i>You've Got Mail </i>(1998)) urges to find some
                  fun, and he hopes, a steady boyfriend. &quot;You think too much.
                  It makes you a great lawyer, but it's the reason you're missing
                  out on all this good stuff, like fun, love, romance.&quot; <br>
<br>
                  Shall we examine the &quot;great lawyer&quot; part of the equation?
                  When we first meet Alex, she's headed for a first date with an
                  ostensibly nice guy. They end up at a pleasant restaurant, to
                  which she brings a cell phone, and she proceeds to take a business
                  call while apologizing insincerely to her date. He finally calls
                  her himself, then bails. We are meant to think her behavior shows
                  how career-minded she is and how it demonstrates how desperately
                  she needs a man to show her how to have a good time. Frankly
                  all it shows me is that she is rude. I wouldn't continue to see
                  a man who did this to me on a first date, and if I did this to
                  someone, I'd certainly expect him to walk out. Is she truly a
                  &quot;great lawyer&quot;? Well, she works at her father's law
                  firm, and apparently has never worked anywhere else. And do career
                  women really need men to show them how to &quot;have a good time&quot;?
                  Is male companionship, charming as it is, quite so necessary
                  to the enjoyment of civilization?<br>
<br>
                  The premise for the first episode, and as it turns out apparently
                  the next few outings, is that one of the firm's big clients wants
                  to develop the land across the street from the law firm's building.
                  The sticking point is the existence of a tavern right in the
                  middle of the block. The pub's owner won't sell. Alex has to
                  convince the owner to sell. Owner has turned over control to
                  his grandson, who turns out to be a cutie named Scott (Josh Randall
                  of <i>Scrubs</i>). Alex falls hard for Scott but does not of
                  course want him to know the extent to which her hormones have
                  engaged. Flirting and sexual banter of the most idiotic ensue.
                  Scott tells her she's much too controlled. She insists she isn't.
                  Suddenly she kisses him, surprising both of them. Apart from
                  the inappropriateness of the behavior, this act seems so out
                  of character for Alex that we don't understand it. How are we
                  to absorb a woman who is both controlling and controlled, yet
                  willing to chase after a man she has just met, all in a single
                  day? Are we to believe that she reached the tipping point? Why?
                  What is it about this particular day that has pushed her over
                  the edge? Nothing in the script explains why THIS day is THE
                  day for Alex and THIS man is THE man. Frankly, nothing about
                  Scott tells us that either. As a character, he is dull and unimpressive,
                  much more dull and unimpressive than both the fellow Alex kept
                  ignoring at the restaurant, and Stephen, the lawyer at her firm
                  her father keeps pushing at her. From what we have seen of them,
                  these men are actually respectful and kind. Does she avoid nice
                  guys? Does she want a man who insults her? She would probably
                  call him &quot;challenging.&quot; I call him vain, patronizing&#133;if
                  he's what she wants, men like him are a dime a dozen. Why has
                  she waited so long and looked so hard?<br>
<br>
                  Stephen, by the way, is another unfortunate fellow Alex uses
                  as a toy. Scott pursues Alex to her office and to put him off,
                  she &quot;accepts&quot; Stephen's &quot;offer&quot; of dinner.
                  A startled Stephen takes her out and tries his best to keep her
                  amused. He ends the evening with every man's nightmare-hoping
                  against hope that that awkward goodnight kiss will persuade this
                  woman he admires to go out with him again even though he knows
                  in his heart he hasn't got a chance. And once again, she does
                  what some pretty women do, and really shouldn't-she manipulates
                  this pleasant but slightly boring guy in order to fend off the
                  advances of another man she secretly finds attractive. She hasn't
                  even given the poor schlub an opportunity to charm her. At least
                  she didn't take along her cell phone. Alex is, on the whole,
                  really not a very kind or particularly interesting woman. Stephen
                  is too good for her.<br>
<br>
                  Meanwhile, the problem of the client who wants to buy out the
                  tavern has not gone away, and Dad still wants Alex to negotiate
                  a deal, which means more conflict. Scott, having informed her
                  that he will not sell, thinks the problem is resolved, and calls
                  her for a date. She dithers, and finally accepts after telling
                  him that seeing him again would not be a good idea. In the middle
                  of the work day, off they go on his motorcycle.<br>
<br>
                  I question several premises about any long term relationship
                  between these two (and any long-term future for this series).
                  First, if Alex is the high-powered career woman and the fascinating
                  creature that the writers want us to believe, I cannot accept
                  that she would find this phenomenally self-absorbed nonentity
                  attractive for more than a few minutes. If she is not, then they
                  deserve each other. Second, if he is as interesting and mercurial
                  as the writers want us to think, and as tied to family as he
                  says (and only someone who is would come back from an exciting
                  career as a Montana smoke jumper to take over a family tavern)
                  then he is not going to find a permanent relationship with a
                  high powered attorney very satisfying. Even if he finds her physically
                  attractive, they still need to share some values in order to
                  make such a commitment work. So far, they don't seem to, so someone
                  is going to have to change some opinions and beliefs. Who will
                  that be? Scott, who as we have discovered is a former investment
                  broker/smoke jumper/tavern owner who doesn't want to sell that
                  family business? Or Alex, the high powered expensively shod attorney
                  who hates to lose, doesn't like to cook and who loves her chic
                  apartment and her nutty friends? I haven't discussed them but
                  in sitcoms like this one they are obligatory and omnipresent.<br>
<br>
                  I have trouble accepting a real love affair between these two.
                  In their initial meeting, Scott knows (or suspects) that Alex
                  is judging him, just as he is judging her, and he clearly resents
                  it. He obviously believes that he has already figured out how
                  to balance career and family, even though he is not married.
                  If he wants to chuck his life as a high income investment type
                  for something more adventurous and macho, then why not? If he
                  then decides that it's time to return to the city to take up
                  his place in the family business because family is more important,
                  then he is the only judge of what's best. But he also apparently
                  believes that he is entitled to say whatever he pleases about
                  a woman he has just met, and an annoyed yet apparently fascinated
                  Alex quite readily points this out to him. She then reverts to
                  a typical female stereotype, having apparently forgotten everything
                  she ever learned about assertiveness from her legal training.
                  She lets him take the lead in their conversation and in their
                  courtship, even though their communication should be entirely
                  professional and they should have no courtship. This kind of
                  writing dredges up every clich&eacute; in the romance lit handbook.
                  A few times she points out that &quot;this is supposed to be
                  a negotiation. We are supposed to be negotiating.&quot; Right,
                  Alex. You are supposed to be representing your client's interests,
                  not your own hormones. Is she allowing him to lead her around
                  by the nose for strategic reasons? I thought for a few minutes
                  that her tactics were aimed at getting somewhere for negotiating
                  reasons, but increasingly, the script led in the direction of
                  romance. She loses her focus as an attorney and becomes more
                  and more a love starved thirty-something with a ticking biological
                  clock. Ugly sitcom reality sets in. Finally she rides off with
                  him in the middle of a workday, but not for business reasons.
                  Yet her client's interests are directly adverse to his, since
                  he has said he has no intention of selling and she has no reason
                  to disbelieve him. And Alex is a good lawyer? Neither she nor
                  her firm should be involved with this fellow. Does this show
                  have a legal consultant? If so, do the writers listen to him
                  or her?<br>
<br>
                  Except for the first episode, which jump starts the Alex-Scott
                  romance, the number of legal situations in this show are so few
                  that I am increasingly certain that this show is not about a
                  lawyer at all. Courting Alex is interested in sending yet another
                  message to professional career women and their desires to &quot;have
                  it all.&quot; In her first conversation with Scott, Alex discovers
                  that he used to be a successful stockbrocker and that he quit
                  to become a firejumper, then returned to New York to take on
                  the family business (the tavern) at the request of his grandfather.
                  Here is a very clear message to the ambitious Alex. Scott is
                  a man to whom career and social position mean very little-at
                  least, that is what he wants her to think. Family and time together
                  should be much more important. These are the values that he signals
                  to her are much more significant-a nice little romantic fiction.
                  He moves quickly to take over what free time she has-in a recent
                  episode her best male friend, Julian, complains she never has
                  time for him anymore. Scott moves rapidly to &quot;fix&quot;
                  that relationship by indicating to Julian that he is not jealous
                  of the man's bond with Alex just as he &quot;fixes&quot; the
                  rest of her life. Scott represents the &quot;right man&quot;
                  for the professional career woman. He is the man who is accepting
                  of her, because he no longer has to compete with her. He has
                  already had a comparable career, and has given it up willingly,
                  so he does not have to demonstrate that he is better than she
                  is. Scott is also a chef-Alex is a bad cook. He is a success
                  in the domestic realm as well.<br>
<br>
                  Scott's tavern can apparently run itself-Scott is always available
                  to whisk Alex away on a date, regardless of the fact that Alex
                  has appointments with clients, as she is continually pointing
                  out to him. In a recent episode, he interrupts her busy day to
                  take her off &quot;for two hours&quot; to relax and to teach
                  her to be spontaneous. She objects but he prevails. The &quot;two
                  hours&quot; turn into an all day plane trip; she gets arrested
                  because she interferes with airport security in order to check
                  in at work, although he warns her against it. Again, the show
                  portrays him as right: she should have relaxed and heeded his
                  direction. When she discovers that her secretary and other attorneys
                  have taken care of her clients without her she is mortified.
<br>
<br>
                  The show plays Alex's insecurities about her career for laughs
                  (even though, remember, she is supposed to be a &quot;great lawyer&quot;),
                  but such insecurities are not necessarily funny, and when Alex
                  objects to Scott's interruptions, she is right to be concerned
                  at the very least, and he is wrong. If the situation were reversed,
                  if a woman were interrupting a man at the office, and he allowed
                  such interruptions, we would see him as weak and ineffectual.
                  We would not respect a male character who allowed a woman to
                  make such a fool of him. He would not be amusing, he would be
                  ridiculous. We would not believe that the characters around him
                  would not notice. By contrast, Alex doesn't risk losing professional
                  standing, precisely because her role as an attorney is so obviously
                  not central to the series. We don't take her seriously as an
                  attorney, because no one on the series does. The characters call
                  her an attorney, but we never see her functioning as an attorney-Scott
                  is always interrupting her. Her father is always telling her
                  to take time off. Whether she is at the office or away with Scott
                  doesn't really matter. She's simply playing at being a lawyer.<br>
<br>
                  I object to this series for its trite writing and situations
                  involving a professional woman, particularly an attorney. Could
                  we substitute any other profession for that of lawyer and get
                  as many &quot;laughs&quot;? Physician? Engineer? University professor?
                  Airline pilot? It's not cute, it's frustrating, that in the early
                  21st century we still have presented to us a sitcom in which
                  a professional woman has reached the pinnacle of her career at
                  the age of 30 or so, and is now placing her search for a man
                  center stage, apparently because the creators, as well as Elfman
                  herself, cannot conceive of anything else as more interesting
                  to explore in this character's life. Does Alex really have nothing
                  left to aspire to than finding a husband and having children?
                  How convenient that in the first episode we discover that she
                  has already taken care of her career-thus it's time to seek a
                  relationship and produce children, to fulfill her womanly destiny.
                  I'm filing a 12(b)(6) motion on <i>Courting Alex</i>: failure
                  to state a storyline in which any kind of amusement, originality,
                  or insight can be found, and I'm reaching for the bicarbonate,
                  at least until I can watch <i>Out of Practice</i> once again.
                  That show has a real ensemble cast, something to say about careers
                  as well as relationships-and no lawyers.<br>
