    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From <i>Witness
    for the Prosecution</i> to <i>Twelve Angry Men</i>, from <i>The Verdict</i> to <i>The Firm</i>,
    movies about lawyers occupy an honored niche in cinema.&nbsp; While the best of these
    movies present universal themes, their character depictions have always been literal.
    &nbsp; Unlike Captain Ahab, who is more than a sea captain,<img src="images/glad1.JPG" alt="glad1.JPG (24666 bytes)" align="right" hspace="12" vspace="12" width="288" height="189"> or Sir Lancelot, who is more than a
    knight, lawyers are always just what they appear to be: lawyers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is what
    makes Ridley Scott&#146;s <i>Gladiator</i> so innovative an addition to the genre. &nbsp;
    Though superficially about Roman gladiators, the movie is actually about lawyers. &nbsp;
    It is based on <i>Litigator</i>, Max I. Moskowitz&#146;s autobiographical account of his
    expulsion from his law firm, and the subsequent resurrection of his professional career.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott tells the
    story of Moskowitz, legal empire builder and litigator, in the form of an allegory about a
    man named Maximus, Roman general and gladiator.&nbsp; This daring cinematic gambit has
    resonated with audiences.&nbsp; When <i>Gladiator</i> premiered before a select audience
    of attorneys, the viewers cheered lustily, pounded their briefcases with their fists, and,
    at the film&#146;s conclusion, rose in unison and gave the &quot;thumbs up&quot;
    signal.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="CENTER"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">* * *</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the start of
    the millennium, Moskowitz is at the height of his powers, the unchallenged rainmaker of
    his firm.&nbsp; Moskowitz&#146;s career has been mentored by the firm&#146;s founder,
    Callaghan, but his rise has earned him the enmity of the founder&#146;s jealous son.
    &nbsp; Dispatched by the management committee to expand the firm&#146;s business,
    Moskowitz has conquered the Silicon Valley, bringing in client after client, and driving
    out or absorbing the New York firms which had migrated into the Valley from the East.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott travels
    back in time to the start of another millennium, and represents Moskowitz as Maximus, the
    Roman general who has conquered Gaul for Marcus Aurelius, his emperor and sponsor. &nbsp;
    The movie begins with Maximus at the head of his legions in a forest, awaiting battle with
    the last force of resisting barbarians.&nbsp; Suddenly a Roman cavalryman emerges from the
    morning mists, galloping toward the Roman lines.&nbsp; As he nears, the viewer sees that
    he is headless.&nbsp; Then the viewer sees the barbarian chief brandishing the unfortunate
    emissary&#146;s head, which he proceeds to toss defiantly at the Romans.&nbsp; Maximus and
    his men recognize this gesture as a signal that negotiations have failed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott bases this
    scene on an incident in Moskowitz&#146;s autobiography where he attempts to negotiate a
    merger with the last remaining New York outpost in Silicon Valley.&nbsp; As he waits
    nervously in his hotel suite for a response to his merger proposal, he looks out his
    window and sees his associate jogging toward him.&nbsp; As the associate nears, Moskowitz
    sees with horror that the associate&#146;s Versace glasses are shattered and his tailored
    suit ripped neatly down the middle. Tearfully, the associate tells Moskowitz that the New
    York lawyers have taken his palm pilot and won&#146;t give it back. Moskowitz understands
    that his proposal has been rejected.&nbsp; He immediately barrages the New Yorkers with
    faxes offering sweet deals to their senior associates and lateral positions for their
    junior partners.&nbsp; By nightfall, Moskowitz has reduced this last redoubt of resistance
    to a branch office of his firm.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Gladiator</i>,
    Maximus looks forward to returning to Rome, to his farm and family, after subduing the
    barbarians.&nbsp; In <i>Litigator</i>, Moskowitz, who has been living out of hotel rooms
    for three years, longs to return to San Francisco, to rejoin his family and to rebuild his
    practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both face disappointment and betrayal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maximus is
    betrayed by Commodus, the jealous son of Marcus Aurelius.&nbsp; Commodus murders his
    father, then has Maximus arrested and slated for execution.&nbsp; Maximus escapes, but he
    cannot save his family, whom Commodus butchers.&nbsp; Maximus ends up sold to the owner of
    a gladiator troop in the distant provinces.&nbsp; Revenge against Commodus becomes his
    sole ambition.&nbsp; To achieve it, Maximus disguises his identity, and embraces the life
    of a gladiator.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott&#146;s plot parallels
    Moskowitz&#146;s account of his own return and exile.&nbsp; Moskowitz had hoped to find an
    increased equity share and a corner office waiting for him upon his return to San
    Francisco.&nbsp; He had dreamed of spending more time with his family, and maybe even
    doing some pro bono work.&nbsp; Instead, he finds that Callaghan, the son of the managing
    partner, has engineered the forced retirement of his father and has manipulated the
    management committee against him. Moskowitz is accused of padding his expense account and
    stealing firm property.&nbsp; Expelled from his firm, and facing ethics charges before the
    State Bar Professional Responsibility Committee, Moskowitz rushes back to his home in
    Piedmont to protect his family.&nbsp; He is too late.&nbsp; A team of law firm
    investigators sent by Callaghan has arrived first, and has ransacked the house, seizing
    legal pads, diskettes, pens, paper clips, and other firm property.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; Convinced that he cannot get
    a fair hearing in San Francisco, Moskowitz escapes to Bakersfield, a rustic Central Valley
    town far from the opulent splendor of San Francisco.&nbsp; Since he has failed to appear
    at the State Bar hearing, he is disbarred and must now practice under an assumed name.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp; <img src="images/glad2.jpg" width="333" height="219" alt="glad2.jpg (30302 bytes)" align="left" hspace="12" vspace="12"> Ridley Scott deftly
    intertwines Moskowitz&#146;s account of exile and resurrection with the tale of Maximus.
    &nbsp; Both men find themselves displaced from their former positions of honor and power,
    forced to lead furtive lives, driven only by revenge.&nbsp; Maximus wins fight after
    brutal fight in the arena.&nbsp; His delighted owner moves the gladiator troop closer and
    closer to Rome, where the money is better.&nbsp; Moskowitz wins trial after trial in the
    Central Valley. His early cases are of the whiplash and slip-and-fall variety, but as his
    reputation grows, so does the size of his cases.&nbsp; Gradually, he moves his practice
    Northward, to Modesto, to Stockton, and finally to San Francisco, where the money is
    better.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Commodus is
    leading a corrupt and debauched life as emperor of Rome.&nbsp; The City yearns for a
    reformer, a man who can restore Rome to its former Republican glory.&nbsp; In <i>Litigator</i>,
    Callaghan is ruining his father&#146;s firm.&nbsp; He and his cronies on the management
    committee have seized all the best corner offices and have voted themselves huge profit
    shares.&nbsp; The top associates and junior partners have left, and those remaining
    desperately hope for a savior for their tottering firm.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; Both tales end with
    climactic confrontations.&nbsp; In <i>Litigator</i>, Moskowitz is called in at the last
    minute to try a major intellectual property case in San Francisco.&nbsp; On the eve of
    trial, he meets with opposing counsel, who turns out to be none other than Callaghan.
    &nbsp; In their dramatic confrontation, Moskowitz, who has been practicing for years under
    an assumed name, reveals his true identity to his former partner &#150; who promptly stabs
    him in the back.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Gladiator</i>, Maximus
    must fight a final battle in the Colisseum with his nemesis.&nbsp; Just before the duel,
    Commodus visits Maximus in his underground chamber.&nbsp; In the guise of a brotherly
    embrace, Commodus stabs him in the back.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; This &quot;stabbing in the
    back&quot; metaphor is one of Ridley Scott&#146;s few dramatic devices which critics have
    faulted.&nbsp; Until that scene, his allegorical technique is symbolic and subtle. &nbsp;
    When Commodus knifes Maximus, however, Scott descends to literalism. &nbsp; &quot;After
    all,&quot; as one Bay Area lawyer and film critic has noted, &quot;stabbing each other in
    the back is just what partners tend to do to one another.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; The destruction of the
    heroes dooms their respective civilizations.&nbsp; Rome declines into despotism. &nbsp;
    Moskowitz&#146;s firm loses partners and clients.&nbsp; Ultimately, much diminished, the
    firm is overrun and absorbed by a horde of barbaric litigators from New York.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="CENTER"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">* * * </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; One sign of the success of
    Ridley Scott&#146;s allegorical device is that it is already being imitated.&nbsp; Brawny
    trial lawyers now swagger into court with undisguised belligerence, and some have taken to
    wearing breastplates in place of vests.&nbsp; Judges are not immune.&nbsp; In some courts,
    following a heated exchange between litigators, judges, instead of ruling from the bench,
    now look to the rowdy, chanting lawyers in the gallery.&nbsp; A thumbs up signal means a
    ruling for the movant; thumbs down means the respondent prevails.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; The phenomenon has spread to
    our own imperial capital.&nbsp; During the penalty phase of the Microsoft antitrust suit,
    Justice Department lawyers urged splitting the company in two.&nbsp; Judge Thomas Penfield
    Jackson stunned the courtroom by uttering: &quot;Gallia est omnis divisa partes
    tres.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
