                  <i>Intolerable Cruelty</i></font></b><font size="-1" face="Verdana"></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Fans of the Coen Brothers (and
                  I am among them) have high expectations.   The writers and directors
                  of such marvelous films as <i>Fargo, The Big Lebowski</i> and
                  <i>The Man Who Wasn't There</i>, the Coen brothers usually deliver
                  off-beat comedies that are very sophisticated and wickedly funny.
                   Their films always have clever scripts with wonderful unexpected
                  twists, great characters (some empathetic, some grotesque), and
                  memorable performances.   They have done it again in <i>Intolerable
                  Cruelty</i> and, if this is the sort of thing you like, you'll
                  probably like this film a lot.   (And I won't disclose details
                  here that will spoil the film for those who haven't yet seen
                  it).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Yet I found the film distressing
                  and these troubling feelings spoiled my enjoyment of it.  I have
                  two issues with <i>Intolerable Cruelty</i>.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/cruelty.jpg" width="187" height="122" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">First,
                  it's a film about lawyers.  The lead is Miles Massey (George
                  Clooney).  He is a divorce lawyer and he is the scum of the earth.
                    The pits, just total slime.  Early in the film, he concocts
                  a totally false story for his client (Bonny Donaly)  and uses
                  her perjured testimony to strip the husband (Donovan Donaly,
                  played by Geoffrey Rush) of his assets (we later see Donaly sleeping
                  on the streets).  Massey continues in kind throughout the movie,
                  disregarding every canon of ethics and every dictate of decency
                  and morality in his law practice.  He is cynical and greedy,
                  contemptuous of clients, hopelessly vain, and totally amoral.
                   The senior partner of Massey's firm, Herb Meyerson, is as grotesque
                  as any character the Coens have ever created-a superannuated
                  monster without intestines who lives on a feeding tube and endlessly
                  intones statistics about billable hours and summary judgments
                  won.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Since the 1980's, the great
                  majority of movie lawyers have been disgusting characters.  
                  Either they are dysfunctional human beings or unethical lawyers--or
                  both.  Yet few of them have been quite as bad as Massey.  He
                  could be compared to Fletcher Reede  (Jim Carrey) in <i>Liar
                  Liar</i> (a lawyer physically incapable of telling the truth)
                  or to John Milton (Al Pacino) in <i>The Devil's Advocate</i>
                  (who was literally Satan come back to earth as the senior partner
                  of a Wall St. firm).   In my humble opinion, the constantly repeated
                  trashing of lawyers in the movies is a factor-not the most important
                  factor but not the least important either-in the stunning decline
                  of the public's opinion of the legal profession over the last
                  twenty-five years or so.   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Right now, lawyers are the
                  most detested and distrusted profession in America (except for
                  used car dealers and, in some surveys, the mass media).  The
                  nasty lawyer jokes we hear all the time are evidence of this.
                   Movies like <i>Intolerable Cruelty</i> are just piling on a
                  profession that is already down.  And I personally don't like
                  it.  I am going to speak out against movies that shamelessly
                  pander to homophobic, anti-semitic, or racist audiences.  And
                  the same goes for vilifying lawyers.  The vast majority of lawyers
                  (not all, of course) are decent, hardworking, ethical people
                  who solve problems for clients and make no better than a decent
                  living in a harsh and highly competitive environment.   Enough
                  already with evil lawyer caricatures in the movies!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Second, I believe <i>Intolerable
                  Cruelty</i> could be the single most inaccurate movie about the
                  law in all movie history.   It is set in California in the present.
                   Every one of the story lines in the film suggests that California
                  has fault divorce.  Thus people are constantly litigating about
                  who committed adultery, because the faithless spouse gets none
                  of the marital property.  Also, someone who is married only briefly
                  gets a huge share of the partner's assets.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Now, this is California, for
                  God's sake.  California was the national leader in 1973 in adopting
                  no-fault divorce.  All states have followed suit with this enlightened
                  reform, although not always to the same degree as California.
                    </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Whether someone committed adultery
                  or other misconduct is totally inadmissible on all issues in
                  California marital property litigation.  The court won't hear
                  it.   Entitlement to get a divorce does not depend in the least
                  upon fault.  &quot;Irreconcilable differences&quot; is all you
                  need. There is an even division of community property (50-50
                  to the penny) regardless of fault.  One spouse's obligation to
                  pay the other spousal support has absolutely nothing to do with
                  the fault of either of them.  Child custody decisions are independent
                  of fault (unless the fault would bear directly on fitness to
                  be a custodian).   And even if this were not true, a spouse has
                  no rights to property owned by the other spouse at the time of
                  marriage (or to income earned by that separate property).   As
                  a result, it is unlikely that a woman who marries a rich man
                  in a short marriage will come away with anything very significant.
                  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Now, the question arises: so
                  what?  For me, this blatant disregard of the applicable law spoiled
                  the movie, just as if the lawyers performed in court while standing
                  on their heads or people were convicted of murder and sentenced
                  to death for stealing a salami sandwich.  Obviously, all movies
                  or TV shows about law distort or oversimplify  law or legal procedure
                  (otherwise movie trials would take 4 days instead of half an
                  hour).   We willingly accept this, of course.  It's just entertainment,
                  not education or a documentary, and slavish adherence to legal
                  details would interfere with the story.  It would be silly to
                  insist on absolute accuracy about the law.   As a result, the
                  question of a movie's accuracy about legal rules or procedures
                  is highly problematic for a law and pop culture critic. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But isn't there a limit?  Shouldn't
                  we criticize filmmakers who completely ignore the law and thus
                  feed a big load of BS to millions of unsuspecting film goers?
                   We criticize filmmakers who are grossly inaccurate about real
                  events in films &quot;based on a true story,&quot; and so we
                  can criticize them for grossly misrepresenting legal rules or
                  procedures.  This is especially true when the film is likely
                  to mislead people about something as fundamental and intimate
                  as their legal rights in situations of marital infidelity.  The
                  filmmakers could have set the film in 1970 instead of 2003, and
                  put it in New York rather than California, and it wouldn't have
                  been quite so far wrong, but it is set in present-day California
                  and it is dead wrong. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Think back to the great legal
                  comedies, like <i>Adam's Rib</i> or <i>My Cousin Vinny</i> or
                  <i>Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</i>, or television series like <i>Rumpole
                  of the Bailey</i>.  These pop culture products were funny because
                  they played the law relatively straight and found opportunities
                  for humor in the strange situations and weird personalities that
                  can arise in legal proceedings.  Other legal comedies, like <i>Bananas</i>,
                  <i>Trial and Error</i>, or <i>A Fish Called Wanda</i> amusingly
                  parodied the law or legal procedure, but nobody watching them
                  would imagine that the law was being correctly stated or applied.
                   <i>Intolerable Cruelty</i> is different from these films, I
                  think in a bad way, by convincingly depicting divorce law in
                  a way that is 180 degrees dead wrong.  <br>
