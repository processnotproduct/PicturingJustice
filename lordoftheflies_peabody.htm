                  Thomas Hobbes, William Golding, and Iraq</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Bruce Peabody</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">William Golding's <i>Lord of
                  the Flies</i> (1954) is a story of marooned British schoolboys
                  who tear apart a social order of their own making. The book has
                  become a touchstone for exploring the limits of human reason
                  and morality, as well as our capacity for extreme indifference,
                  cruelty, and even iniquity.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But <i>Lord of the Flies</i>
                  is also a tale about law. The 50th anniversary of Golding's work
                  provides an occasion for reflecting on the enduring significance
                  of the book and the two films it inspired (1963, 1990) by retrieving
                  this somewhat neglected narrative of law founded, undermined,
                  and seemingly reclaimed.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/lordoftheflies.jpg" width="116" height="168" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">I
                  make this case by interpreting Peter Brooks' 1963 film through
                  the lens of political theory. Using Thomas Hobbes's <i>Leviathan</i>
                  to push and extend Golding's story helps us rediscover telling
                  insights bypassed in more traditional accounts of these works.
                  And it provides fresh lessons for a contemporary setting marked
                  by strife, the limits of human foresight, and bloodshed: Iraq.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">From the outset, Brooks suggests
                  the power and constancy of the forces pushing to undo a fragile
                  social order. He begins with a contrast of grainy still images
                  - the organized life of the boys' boarding school, and the symbols
                  of a war that forces their evacuation and exile. The first live
                  action scene has Ralph stepping somewhat gingerly through an
                  island jungle, still dressed in his anomalous school uniform
                  and accompanied by the drone of a fly. Again we confront the
                  tension between humans in civil society and more chaotic surroundings.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The children sense the potential
                  for discord and attempt to intervene by recreating some of the
                  conventions and structures from their former life. They convene,
                  elect a leader, and establish rules. &quot;Got to have rules
                  and obey them,&quot; Jack enthusiastically proclaims. &quot;After
                  all, we're not savages. We're English, and the English are best
                  at everything. Lots of rules, and when anybody breaks them&#133;&quot;
                  The sanction is not discussed, but the raucous hooting of Jack's
                  classmates implies the consequences will be severe.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The children's experiment in
                  self-rule is initially successful, yielding the benefits of cooperation.
                  They make decisions collectively and delegate vital tasks of
                  reconnaissance, food gathering, and starting a fire. But things
                  start to go awry when Jack and his band of hunters let the fire
                  go out, compromising the boys' chance of being rescued by a passing
                  plane. The children's society is strained further as they grapple
                  with runaway anxiety over a shadowy &quot;beast&quot; on the
                  island, and as factions develop between Ralph and Jack, who is
                  increasingly prone to violence. By the end of the film, Simon
                  and Piggy have been killed, and Jack and his followers pursue
                  Ralph with lethal purpose. The rout of civilization seems complete.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The <i>Lord of the Flies</i>
                  has been depicted as a study in evil, but, more accurately, it
                  makes a desperate, implicit case for convention and law. For
                  Golding and Brooks, our salvation and undoing come from the same
                  source: our own incapacity to form human institutions based on
                  deliberation and rational planning, rather than submitting to
                  force, fear, and violence.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Thomas Hobbes's <i>Leviathan</i>
                  tells a remarkably similar story about our weakness and creativity.
                  Hobbes begins his famous work by painting a picture of human
                  motivation and behavior prior to society. While some associate
                  this &quot;state of nature&quot; with lawlessness and entropy,
                  Hobbes is more careful in his depiction.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">People are not impelled by
                  inherent malice or bloodthirstiness he says. Instead, they are
                  largely motivated by deep seated fear and egoism - satisfying
                  their own passions and escaping harm. These elements of human
                  behavior are prominently displayed in <i>Lord of Flies</i>. They
                  are captured, for example, by the terror induced by the fantastic
                  beast, and the self-regard of Jack, who neglects common projects
                  and forms a breakaway group &quot;to hunt and have feasts and
                  have fun.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">For Hobbes, people are also
                  rational, albeit in a somewhat restricted form. We use reason
                  to help obtain our objectives, but not to choose amongst competing
                  goals or values. Golding's schoolboys certainly exhibit this
                  limited, instrumental rationality in creating shelter, fashioning
                  weapons, and hunting prey.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">People in the state of nature
                  are also somewhat law-regarding, according to Hobbes, insofar
                  as they discover and act upon natural law. Notably, we are authorized
                  in trying to preserve ourselves, and doing anything to protect
                  that existence, including acquiring power and subjugating, even
                  destroying, competitors.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But these arrangements are
                  extremely unstable, and the state of nature quickly lapses into
                  a state &quot;of war of every one against every one.&quot; Individuals
                  exercise their right to self-preservation in an atmosphere of
                  distrust and anxiety, fearing that others will deprive them of
                  their interests and the means (wealth, honor, or power) to securing
                  these ends.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The resulting tumult and disorder
                  is inhospitable to culture, science, and human achievement generally.
                  As Hobbes puts it, in this environment, there will be &quot;no
                  knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts;
                  no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual
                  fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man [will
                  be] solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&quot; Since there
                  is no body of laws, or authority to enforce them, the state of
                  nature is also devoid of property, justice, and a sense of good
                  and evil outside of what harms or pleases us. &quot;Where there
                  is no common power, there is no law; where no law, no injustice.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This grim moral landscape is
                  reproduced in <i>Lord of the Flies</i>. The boys initially cooperate
                  for self-defense, but their collaboration proves friable, and
                  competition and incipient violence hangs heavily over all their
                  interactions. When Jack first appears, he is accompanied by his
                  choir, marching in militaristic fashion. Indeed, they go on to
                  become the island's hunters who ultimately kill Simon and Piggy
                  and pursue Ralph.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/lordoftheflies90.jpg" width="118" height="168" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">From
                  the outset, Ralph and Jack struggle over their respective claims
                  to rule and what Hobbes calls a love of &quot;dominion over others.&quot;
                  In forming his own splinter political community, Jack denies
                  that Ralph can provide security to others and that his decision-making
                  extends to others:</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Jack: Who are you anyway just
                  sitting there telling people what to do? You can't hunt. You
                  can't sing.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Ralph: I am chief. I was chosen.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Jack: Why should choosing make
                  any difference? [Contemptuously]Telling people what to do&#133;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In addition to these dynamics,
                  the children battle over objects of common interest - Piggy's
                  glasses, food, shelter, and fire. Eventually, the continued eruption
                  of conflict destroys the fruit of the boys' nascent society and
                  plunges them into chaos. In addition to letting the fire go out,
                  Jack and his followers destroy the huts of Ralph's camp and smash
                  Piggy's glasses.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">These conditions do not create
                  a fertile medium for claims to justice. After Simon's death,
                  Ralph despairs that the children have committed &quot;murder.&quot;
                  Piggy, heretofore a figure of reason and humanity, bristles at
                  this suggestion. &quot;You stop it,&quot; he tells Ralph. &quot;What
                  good are you doing talking like that? It was dark. There was
                  that bloody dance. There was thunder and lightning and rain.
                  We were scared. It wasn't&#133;what you said.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">For Hobbes, there is one path
                  out of these bleak circumstances. Fear of death and the desire
                  for security and the fruits of human organization, lead people
                  to renounce their natural right to self-defense and to embrace
                  instead &quot;convenient articles of peace.&quot; We leave the
                  state of war and enter civil society by recognizing and empowering
                  a sovereign with ultimate, unchallenged authority over its subjects.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This Leviathan, or &quot;mortal
                  god,&quot; holds and exercises an overwhelming and visible &quot;coercive&quot;
                  power over everyone else. It is the terrible threat of the Leviathan's
                  monopoly of power that quells individual passions and creates
                  an environment in which people can better &quot;preserve peace
                  [and] recognize obligations to one another, to enforce agreements,
                  to move beyond mere individual enforcement of the right to self
                  preservation.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In <i>Lord of the Flies</i>,
                  the children's longing for an authoritative sentinel of order
                  is a recurrent motif. In the initial scene, Piggy asks hopefully:
                  &quot;Are there any grownups?&quot; Ralph confidently promises
                  that &quot;Daddy's a commander in the navy - one day when he
                  gets leave, he'll come and rescue us.&quot; Even Jack asks to
                  see &quot;the man with the trumpet&quot; after Ralph blows a
                  conch shell to summon the boys to a meeting. Upon being informed
                  that this figure does not exist, Jack surmises &quot;we'll have
                  to look after ourselves.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The importance of unified,
                  identifiable authority is further suggested by Ralph's subsequent
                  plea to a rebellious Jack:</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Ralph: The rules. You're breaking
                  the rules&#133;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Jack: Who cares?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Ralph: Because the rules are
                  the only thing we got&#133;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The importance of Hobbes's
                  &quot;mortal god&quot; is arguably captured most powerfully in
                  the film's final scene. With Jack and his hunters in close and
                  feral pursuit, Ralph stumbles away from the burning jungle and
                  onto the beach. As his pursuers close, Ralph falls before a pair
                  of feet - and the camera pans upward to reveal a towering figure
                  in military uniform. The children are speechless, awed. Ralph
                  weeps in relief, while Jack looks on, defeated and cowed. In
                  a moment, chaos is repelled, and order is restored with this
                  vision of authority bolstered by the incipient threat of arms
                  (in the 1990 film, a helicopter gunship hovers in the background).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Hobbes's and Golding's raw
                  depictions of the instability of social life can be usefully
                  imported to the present. The violent streets of Baghdad and Falluja
                  resemble the brutality depicted in both <i>Leviathan</i> and
                  <i>Lord of the Flies</i>. But more interestingly, the Bush Administration's
                  efforts to secure and somehow transmit the conditions for sovereignty
                  can be mapped alongside both Hobbes's project and the struggles
                  of the schoolboys. Among other implications, these works suggest
                  the enormity of the challenges facing those hoping for a secure
                  and stable postwar Iraq.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">For Hobbes, we leave the turmoil
                  of the state of nature by reducing all our passions and interests
                  &quot;unto one will,&quot; and conferring nearly all of our power
                  to the Leviathan. This transfer of authority will be legitimated
                  by each citizen recognizing him or herself as the &quot;author&quot;
                  of the new government.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In contemporary Iraq, there
                  is surely widespread agreement that greater order is needed in
                  the country. But the continued hostility of radical and more
                  moderate Iraqis to both American troops and the nation's fledgling
                  institutions and leaders, suggests that many do not see themselves
                  as the &quot;authors&quot; of the U.S. sponsored regime.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Complementing this observation,
                  <i>Leviathan</i> and <i>Lord of the Flies</i> remind us that
                  governance and the rule of law depend not so much upon removing
                  authority, as establishing it. Hobbes and Golding both suggest
                  that discord is &quot;natural,&quot; and that the state, while
                  necessary, is essentially artificial and imposed. Seen in this
                  light, the ouster of Saddam Hussein was the &quot;easy&quot;
                  part of the Iraqi campaign.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Political unity is vital to
                  securing a new polity. Divisions over a political community's
                  legitimacy threaten its preeminent purpose - maintaining peace
                  internally and checking hostility from abroad. Indeed, Hobbes
                  argues, if the state fails to guarantee the basic security of
                  its subjects, individuals may rightfully revert to self-preservation.
                  In this sense, even the all-powerful Leviathan operates on strictly
                  borrowed time. &quot;You've got to be tough,&quot; Piggy admonishes
                  Ralph, as the boys' society threatens to unravel completely.
                  &quot;Make them do what you want.&quot; But Ralph worries. &quot;If
                  I blow the conch and they don't come back, then we've had it.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In other words, the emperor's
                  clothes can fall away in a moment. The inability of U.S. and
                  Iraqi military and civilian forces to prevent lethal attacks
                  is, therefore, not just bad press, but a direct challenge to
                  the status of the nascent government as a coherent political
                  entity.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">On July 1, the United States
                  has committed to handing sovereignty to the Iraqi people. The
                  images of political disarray powerfully captured in <i>Lord of
                  the Flies</i> and <i>Leviathan</i> suggest both the stakes and
                  the uncertainty of this transfer. Should the new government falter,
                  of course, the U.S. would seem poised to &quot;return&quot; as
                  the resident power - the Leviathan. But this prospect is unnerving,
                  not reassuring, and suggests that this summer may mark the beginning
                  rather than the end of U.S. involvement in an unstable nation
                  and region.</font></p>
