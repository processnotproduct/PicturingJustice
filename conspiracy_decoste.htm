                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So speaks SS Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer
                  Reinhard Heydrich in this (HBO/BBC 2001), the second (afterHeinz
                  Schirk's 1984 German-language <i>Wannseekonferenz</i>), and very
                  much more accomplished, dramatic depiction of the Conference
                  of 20 January, 1942, at the Wannsee Haus in suburban Berlin,
                  concerning the fate of European Jewry. What was at issue at Wannsee
                  was not whether Jews would die -- the barbarity had already begun
                  some seven months earlier with the gassing of Jews at Chelmo
                  -- but rather whether the killing of Jews would be pursued as
                  state policy as regards all Jews and throughout the whole of
                  Europe under German occupation or influence. So there ensues,
                  in the film as it did in life, a discussion concerning whether
                  such a policy could sound in law and, if so, what law might then
                  mean.<br>
                   <br>
                  <img src="images/conspiracy.jpg" width="150" height="202" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The major players in this discourse
                  are Heydrich, head of the Reich Security Main Office and favored
                  deputy of Reichsf&uuml;hrer SS Heinrich Himmler, as chair and
                  convenor (brilliantly delivered by Kenneth Branagh as Edith Wharton's
                  blond beast, a being at once carnal and cultured: in rejecting
                  sterilization as the answer to the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;
                  -- &quot;Dead men don't hump. Dead women don't get pregnant.
                  Death is the most reliable form of sterilization. Put it that
                  way&quot;; yet the adagio of Schubert's C Major String Quintet
                  remains for him, the concert-competent violinist, music to &quot;tear
                  your heart out&quot;); SS Obersturmbannf&uuml;hrer Adolf Eichmann,
                  Heydrick subordinate and head of the Gestapo Jewish Evacuation
                  Office (here wonderfully rendered by Stanley Tucci, not merely
                  as the apotheosis of the suckup/kickdown bureaucratic functionary,
                  but in contrast to Branagh's Heydrich, with subtlety, as the
                  brutish and contemptuous common man: his sneering condescension
                  for the staff at Wannsee -- SS comrades one and all -- opens
                  the film (amid the hum of silver being polished, drapes drawn,
                  crystal cleaned, flowers arranged, name cards inscribed, wine,
                  cognac and cigars placed, and very German foods prepared, the
                  sound of broken wine glasses: Eichmann to what appears to be
                  the chief steward at Wannsee, &quot;Do we have enough? How many
                  fell?&quot;; &quot;I'm sure we have a sizable inventory, sir&quot;;
                  &quot;You're sure or you know?&quot;; &quot;I know sir&quot;;
                  &quot;Itemize the cost. He pays. Make it a separate report to
                  me. And keep him where I don't see him&quot;; then leeringly
                  to a female steward, his SS jacket held open in her arms ready
                  to envelope him properly for the meeting, &quot;Smile. It is
                  a fine day&quot;); and his venomous denunciation of Heydrich's
                  &quot;passion for Schubert's sentimental Viennese shit&quot;
                  very nearly concludes it); Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart, chief draftsman
                  of the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 and head of the Four Year Plan,
                  Ministry of the Interior (Colin Firth's wonderful performance
                  makes of  Stuckart an Albert Speer, the squeamish in-but-not-of
                  Nazi); and Friedrich Wilhelm Kritzinger, Ministerial Director,
                  Reich Chancellery, representing Hitler (Jonathan Coy's portrayal
                  matches Firth's in excellence and in design).<br>
                   <br>
                  That the Holocaust proceeded from a debate about the limits of
                  law may surprise those who, lead perhaps by the popular media,
                  take the Holocaust as an expression of mindless hatred. Many
                  may be surprised as well to discover -- as Raul Hilberg, the
                  dean of Holocaust studies, seeks always to remind us -- that
                  the Holocaust was a surprise to all involved, victims, bystanders
                  and perpetrators alike (indeed, Hilberg reports that Heydrich
                  himself was &quot;ashen-faced&quot; on first being informed that
                  the Final Solution meant the physical destruction of European
                  Jewry). However, conceiving of the Holocaust in any other fashion
                  -- as an orgy of murder rather than as an act of state framed
                  by the discourses of civilized life or as a vision pursued and
                  planned rather than as a sequence of events made possible, but
                  not inevitable, by certain moral and political commitments --
                  shelters us from the Holocaust's horrific historical and moral
                  burden: its revelation, as human possibilities, of a new form
                  of death, <i>Vernichtung</i>, death as manufacture, desacralized
                  and meaningless, nothing, and of a new form of being, <i>Lebensunwertig</i>,
                  life unworthy of life, meaningless even to itself, an insult
                  to life. It is its invention of these -- this understanding of
                  morality and this form of being -- that will forever burden Germany
                  with shame and guilt, and the rest of the world with an irreparable
                  harm, that insidious mistrust which ever since shrouds our sense
                  and experience of life.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">That this film (directed by
                  Frank Pierson, and written by Loring Mandel: wonderfully and
                  intelligently by both) discloses that debate and surprise, and
                  in a manner that lays bare the intellectual and legal architecture
                  of the destruction that followed Wannsee, makes of it a towering
                  achievement, not least for lawyers. Indeed, for lawyers especially:
                  not only because seven of the Conference's fifteen participants
                  held advanced degrees in law (Stuckart; Kritzinger; Dr. Roland
                  Freisler, Ministry of Justice and later president of the People's
                  Court, the infamous Volksgerichtsgof; Dr. Josef B&uuml;hler,
                  representing Hans Frank, Governor General of Occupied Poland
                  and former Reich Minister of Justice and President of the Academy
                  of German Law; SS Oberf&uuml;hrer Gerhard Klopper (&quot;How
                  many lawyers are in this room? Raise your hand. Oh, Jesus Christ.
                  It's worse than I thought&quot;) director of the Party Chancellery's
                  legal division under Martin Bormann; and Drs. Karl Eberhard Sch&ouml;ngarth
                  and Rudolf Lange, SS Oberf&uuml;hrer and Sturmbannf&uuml;hrer
                  respectively and distinguished from other participants by their
                  service as commanders of Einsatzgrupppen murder battalions on
                  the Eastern Front (two other participants also held doctorates:
                  Alfred Meyer, a Ph.D. in political science, and Georg Leiberandt,
                  a combined doctorate in theology, philosophy, history and economics,
                  both representing the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern
                  Territories); nor only because, as Hilberg puts it, &quot;Lawyers
                  were everywhere and their influence was pervasive. Again and
                  again, there was a need for legal justification&quot;; but also,
                  and perhaps more profoundly for the present, because the discourse
                  at Wannsee concerning law and the limits of power to perfect
                  the world and the place of difference in law remains for lawyers
                  central to their deciding whether lawyering has the point and
                  passion of an office or is instead a practice of service to power.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">All of the lawyers at Wannsee,
                  save two, had no hesitation at all in affirming the latter: for
                  instance, Klopper (devastatingly delivered as corpulent -- yet
                  still sly and intelligent -- corruption by Ian McNeiece), &quot;We
                  make the law we need&quot; and, then, in response to Stuckart's
                  <i>cri de coeur</i> concerning &quot;the obligation to maintain
                  a lawful society,&quot; &quot;Fuck&quot;; and Freisler (perfectly
                  played by Owen Teak as the banal, self-serving ideologue who
                  would later become Hitler's favorite legal executioner, presiding
                  as the screaming judicial interrogator at the show trials of
                  White Rose students Hans and Sophie Scholl in 1943 and of the
                  Bomb Plot accused in 1944), &quot;Let's get it done, and if we
                  skip a few steps, so be it&quot; and, then, &quot;Well, the Ministry
                  of Justice which I represent, can live with it, gladly.&quot;
                  Indeed, it fell to Stuckart and Kritzinger alone among them to
                  carry law's brief against the legal cynicism and political millenarianism
                  of Heydrich. But Heydrich was to win the day, not only because
                  his cynicism would let loose brute power against his interlocutors
                  (Heydrich to Stuckart alone in conversation: &quot;Every agency
                  will come to follow my order or asses will sting. And there are
                  no shortages of meat hooks on which to hang enemies of the state.
                  ... You have a choice to make. ... I do not wish to see the bullies
                  -- I admit we have more than our fair share of them in the SS
                  -- take too much of an interest in you&quot; &quot;Interest in
                  me?&quot; &quot;Do you not think&quot;, drippingly, dropping
                  his cigarette at Stuckart's feet; to Kritzinger, again alone:
                  &quot;You'd be a hard man to bring down, but certainly not impossible.
                  ... Sitting again at that table, I will ask for your agreement
                  to what has been proposed.&quot; &quot;And I must answer now?&quot;
                  &quot;Oh, you will answer now or you will answer later.&quot;
                  &quot;I will not oppose you.&quot; &quot;I want more than that.&quot;
                  &quot;Of course.&quot; &quot;Good. We understand each other.&quot;),
                  but also, and more instructively, because he, unlike they, blinded
                  each of them by personal and professional conceit, recognized
                  the inevitability of the destination -- as possibility, if not
                  always, as here, as practice -- bred of subordinating law to
                  power's ambition and of permitting law to take account of difference.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Just before the Conference
                  begins, Stuckart and Kritzinger share, <i>sotto voce</i>, conspiratorially,
                  their mutual disdain for their fellows, for the SS especially.
                  Stuckart to Kritzinger: &quot;It is very complex. These laws,
                  a lot  of time and thought has been put to them and some of these
                  here -- well you notice all the SS -- have little idea of what
                  is lawful in their respect for what they do.&quot; Kritzinger:
                  &quot;Certainly not these gentlemen. To them the laws are like
                  ice cream. Easy to melt.&quot; Heydrich knows his quarry well,
                  and showing false and indeed silly, and then destroying, this
                  elitism -- about intelligence about and commitment to the law
                  -- becomes the focus of his conduct of the meeting. <br>
                   <br>
                  Good manager he, he first recounts the path of the Reich's Jewish
                  policy: first the Nuremberg Laws, which aimed &quot;to expel
                  them from all means by which our people would have to deal with
                  them&quot; and &quot;established the fundamental legality for
                  the creation of a Jew-free society&quot; and then the pursuit
                  of &quot;a vigorous policy of emigration&quot; (&quot;But who
                  would take more of them? Who would want them was the policy's
                  ultimate limitation. Every border ... rejects them. Even America.&quot;)
                  and finally the consequences of the Reich's military successes
                  in Poland and in the East (&quot;The dimensions of this problem
                  ... have magnified astoundingly: five million!&quot;). The past
                  to which all present, Stuckart and Kritzinger especially included,
                  had consented, thus recalled, Heydrich commences with the Reich's
                  response to &quot;this new situation&quot; as expressed in Reichmarshall
                  Hermann G&ouml;ring's directive of 31 July, 1941 to himself --
                  &quot;you have a copy in your folders&quot; -- &quot;the operative
                  words ... 'bringing about a complete solution to the Jewish Question
                  in the German sphere of influence in Europe.'&quot;  Heydrich:
                  &quot;Now, for that I read the cleansing of the entire continent
                  of Europe. ... All of Europe.... No Jews. Not one.&quot; Then:
                  &quot;The policy that will take the place of emigration is evacuation&quot;;
                  and &quot;Everything we have done flows from the Nuremberg Laws....
                  And now we have to examine those. ... The exemptions written
                  into the law allow too many Jews to remain among us.&quot; Thus,
                  does he confront the law, in stages and by manoeuvre: now, it
                  remains only for the Conference to determine the meaning of evacuation
                  and the future warrant of the Law.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Lange (remarkably delivered
                  by Barnaby Kay as a near sullen mix of lawyer and murderer) puts
                  the question to Heydrich: &quot;Dear General, sorry. I have the
                  real feeling I evacuated thirty thousand Jews already by shooting
                  them at Riga. Is what I did evacuation? When they fell were they
                  evacuated?&quot; Heydrich: &quot;Yes, in my personal opinion,
                  they are evacuated.&quot; Kirtzinger: &quot;Explain!&quot; &quot;I
                  have just done so.&quot; &quot;That is not.... No, that is contrary
                  to what the Chancellery has been told. I have directly been assured,
                  I have, that .... Purge the Jews, yes. But to annihilate them
                  ... That we have undertaken to systematically annihilate all
                  the Jews of Europe, no that possibility has personally been denied
                  to me by the F&uuml;hrer.&quot; Heydrich with bemused condescension:
                  &quot;And it will continue to be.&quot; &quot;Yes, I understand.
                  Yes, he will continue to deny it.&quot; Heydrich with barely
                  concealed contempt: &quot;My apologies. Do you accept my apologies?&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Then Stuckart on the meaning
                  of Law: &quot;The Nuremberg Laws are very specific. ... I find
                  the plan unworkable. I find the plan personally insulting in
                  that I have given years to codifying the laws.... My work, these
                  laws, any legal code worthy of the name restricts the enforcers
                  of it as well as its subjects. There are some things you cannot
                  do.&quot; Heydrich: &quot;As you see it.&quot; Stuckart, lecturing:
                  &quot;To kill them casually without regard for the law, martyrs
                  them which will be their victory. Sterilization recognizes them
                  as a part of our species but prevents them from being a part
                  of our race. They will disappear soon enough. And we will have
                  acted in defense of our race and of our species and by the law.&quot;
                  Then less: &quot;I'm pointing out the difficulty of casting every
                  Jew ... into the sausage machine, and if that's the plan, I'm
                  asking that some legal framework be built.&quot; Kritzinger at
                  one point in support: &quot;He believes in the supremacy of law.
                  ... You accept casually the obliteration of legal distinctions
                  and the use of extreme, inconceivable measures. ... That is where
                  we have come.&quot; Heydrich, exasperated: &quot;I can't give
                  a damn rule for everything.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But all of this protest is
                  posture. The proof lies not in their revealing themselves as
                  cowards in collapsing before Heydrich's threats, but in their
                  refusing to acknowledge that their National Socialist commitments
                  -- to the Nuremberg Laws, to the F&uuml;hrer, to political millenarianism
                  -- meant the death of law and of their professional commitments,
                  save each as private conceit or else, as here, as public petulance.
                  In this, by contrast, Heydrich is wise. To Kritzinger: &quot;This
                  is the moment to be practical until such time as Germany can
                  afford your philosophy, which is what? Hound them, impoverish
                  them, exploit them, imprison them, just do not kill them and
                  you are God's noblest of men. I find that truly remarkable.&quot;
                  To all a reminder of <i>F&uuml;hrerprinzip</i>: &quot;I would
                  like to remind all of you that our F&uuml;hrer enunciates the
                  goal. Our task, to turn his vision to reality. We can debate
                  the 'how'; we can debate the 'when' up to a point; we cannot
                  debate the 'if'. ... His word is above all written law.&quot;
                  To Lange, his self-understanding: &quot;Beautiful lake. When
                  the War ends, I shall come to this house and rise to see it every
                  day and dream comforting things. I am a dreamer as I think you
                  are. ... We look forward to a better day, a peaceful world, a
                  German culture triumphant. That is what we work for. ... We are
                  servant soldiers, are we not? ... That is what we are indeed.&quot;
                  (Heydrich was not, of course, to live his dream: Reinhard Tristan
                  Eugen Heydrich -- Protector of Bohemia and Moravia and Himmler's
                  trusted organizer of the machinery of genocide -- was to die
                  on 4 June, 1942 from injuries sustained in the British organized
                  assassination attempt of 27 May.) Then, to all, the &quot;triumphant
                  German vision&quot;: &quot;So this is my commandment to you here.
                  Link arms, your units, your ministries, apply your intelligence,
                  apply your energies. The machinery is waiting. Feed it. Get them
                  on the trains. Keep the trains  rolling. And history will honour
                  us for having the will and the vision to advance the human race
                  to greater purity in a space of time so short Charles Darwin
                  would be astonished.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At Wannsee, these core elements
                  of Hitlerism -- collective, identity-based  difference, authoritarianism,
                  and utopianism -- became radicalized. Wannsee was the Hitler
                  revolution, and with it, the world changed (Kirtzinger to Lange:
                  &quot;This is more than war. Must be a different word for this&quot;).
                  Thereafter, Jewish difference became Otherness, and radicalized
                  Otherness meant legal nudity, a flagrant, utter, exposure to
                  the claims of insistent and ubiquitous power. The <i>F&uuml;hrerprinzip</i>
                  ceased to serve as a vague <i>grundnorm</i> and became instead
                  cause for a false legality characterized by prerogative law and
                  unrestrained interpretation by ideologically driven judges, lawyers,
                  and legal scholars. And now taken seriously, the millenarianism
                  championed in <i>Mein Kampf</i> made the inconceivable conceivable:
                  Eichmann, &quot;We expect to be able to process 2500 an hour,
                  not a day&quot;; someone, &quot;Sixty thousand Jews a day go
                  up in smoke!&quot;; Heydrich, &quot;We can achieve that. Imagine.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Imagine. And yet we continue
                  to imagine that somehow the law can make whole the world, that
                  it can count and construct difference, that its constraint is
                  properly, electively, porous: like they before us, provided only
                  the cause be right and the warrant redemption.  <br>
