                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">&quot;Revenge&quot; genre films
                  tend to fit into neat little schemes. The storyline will involve
                  the protagonist being wronged, usually in the first half of the
                  movie, and the rest of the film will be a portrayal of this hero,
                  or avenger, taking the law into their own hands to exact vengeance
                  on those who have crossed him. The audience undergoes a great
                  sense of satisfaction when vengeance is finally delivered because
                  the audience has been brought on board with the avenger's cause
                  and agree that what he had to do to exact vengeance is justified.
                  It is necessary for the avenger to take the law in his own hands
                  because the legal system in which the revenge genre film takes
                  place is either perfidious and corrupt, or simply ineffectual
                  and unable to uphold justice. An incompetent legal order is essential
                  to our accepting the revenge genre film. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/kingpecos.jpg" width="150" height="215" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The 1936 Joseph Kane western film,
                  <i>King of the Pecos</i>, tells such a story of revenge. In the
                  beginning of the film, the antagonist trio of an exploiting capitalist
                  Alexander Stiles, his lawyer Brewster, and his killer Ash take
                  title to strategic watering holes between Texas and the Kansas
                  cattle markets in order to gain control of a million acre empire.
                  One of the key watering hole locations, that of Sweetwater, is
                  located on land owned by a man who has settled there with his
                  wife and their teenage son. When the man refuses Stiles' offer
                  of one thousand dollars to buy the land, the man and his wife
                  are shot, and the teenage son is brutally beaten up and left
                  for dead.<br>
<br>
                  Ten years pass and the boy, John Clayborn, who of course did
                  not die, has become a man and a lawyer, played by John Wayne.
                  He ends up representing a large group of independent cattle owners
                  and takes on Stiles, represented by Brewster, in a civil trial
                  aimed at gaining access to the water holes controlled by Stiles
                  without having to pay the exorbitant tolls he demands. The Court
                  finds that, based on homestead laws, Stiles is only entitled
                  to one of his water hole claims, that of Sweetwater. Brewster
                  is fired by Stiles for losing the trial.<br>
<br>
                  The setting of the film being the late nineteenth century western
                  frontier, law enforcement is undeveloped. Despite his losing
                  of the legal trial, there is inadequate legal order to prevent
                  Stiles from using force. No longer able to control the rancher's
                  cattle through the watering holes, Stiles orders Ash and his
                  men to gather all of their cattle by force. To escape Stiles
                  and his men, Clayborn organizes the ranchers into a mass cattle
                  drive that must stop in Sweetwater on its way to Abilene. When
                  Stiles refuses access to Sweetwater, Clayborn and the ranchers
                  kill Stiles and Ash in much the same fashion that Clayborn's
                  parents were murdered years before. The young lawyer's revenge
                  is complete, and he needed to use force beyond law in order to
                  extract it. <br>
<br>
                  <i>King of the Pecos</i> is not alone among westerns in its portrayal
                  of justice. &quot;Countless westerns not only from the thirties
                  but from every decade deal either with the struggle between frontier
                  anarchy and emerging social order or with the struggle between
                  an evolved but unjust social order and the felt need to set things
                  right by taking the law into one's own hands.&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">1</a>)
                  The untamed setting of the western film is ideal for the revenge
                  genre as the inept legal order allows for the avenger to uphold
                  his own sense of justice when seeking vengeance with minimal
                  hampering from law enforcement. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/unforgiven.jpg" width="150" height="199" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Such is the setting in another
                  story of revenge that is found in the more recent western <i>Unforgiven</i>
                  which Clint Eastwood both stars in and directed. Eastwood plays
                  the role of William Munny, a once ruthless killing cowboy, who
                  has been tamed by his wife into a domesticated rancher and father
                  of two. However, as the film begins we discover that Munny has
                  fallen on hard times as his wife has passed of smallpox, and
                  the life of a pig farmer has proved difficult. Munny becomes
                  attracted to a bounty that has been placed on the life of two
                  cowboys by the prostitutes in the town of Big Whisky - punishment
                  for their cutting the face of one of the working girls. <br>
<br>
                  The sheriff of Big Whisky, Little Bill, characterizes the film's
                  underdeveloped and largely ineffective law enforcement. He offers
                  to sentence the two cowboys to being whipped, but this proves
                  unsatisfactory to both the whores and to owner of the brothel,
                  Skinny, although for different reasons. The prostitutes do not
                  see a mere whipping as being just punishment for something as
                  gruesome and permanently scaring as the cutting of one's face.
                  A whipping would not cause the cowboys to suffer enough for justice
                  to be served. For Skinny, his interest is purely economical,
                  and a scarred whore is of much less value to him. Thus when Little
                  Bill changes the punishment to the payment of ponies to Skinny,
                  Skinny is satisfied to have recovered his economic loss, while
                  the prostitutes feel the need to take the law into their own
                  hands by putting the bounty out on the two cowboys' lives. <br>
<br>
                  While it is the prostitutes who are seeking revenge, the audience
                  does not get the strong feeling of this being a 'revenge' genre
                  film until later when Munny's good friend Ned, with whom he is
                  seeking the bounty, is captured and killed by Little Bill. While
                  we do feel some sense of justice is being inflicted on the two
                  cowboys by the prostitutes' bounty, and we get the sense the
                  Munny does too, death does seem a bit excessive for what they
                  have done. What makes <i>Unforgiven</i> a compelling movie is
                  that it is not a clear cut case of good vs. evil as in <i>King
                  of the Pecos</i>. The movie going audience has perhaps matured
                  beyond the westerns of the 1930s, demanding movies that force
                  them to reflect on them afterwards. Little Bill is not all bad.
                  He does make attempts to uphold the law, but we resent him for
                  his treatment of the prostitutes as property, and we find his
                  whipping and killing of Ned, a character who is developed in
                  the film and whom we like, to be unwarranted and savage. Unlike
                  <i>King of the Pecos</i>, it is an imperfect story of revenge.
<br>
<br>
                  This theme is perfectly portrayed through Eastwood's character
                  who himself is cynical of justice in the world. He says the incongruous
                  line of &quot;deserves got nothing to do with it&quot; to Little
                  Bill just before killing him as revenge for killing Ned, something
                  Munny clearly did feel he deserved. Munny has developed this
                  contemptuous stance towards justice through the events of his
                  own life. A one time ruthless killer of women and children, &quot;the
                  fact that no one ever brought him to justice for his past evil
                  deeds, makes him think the delivery of justice purely random,
                  a matter of luck.&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">2</a>) He sees himself
                  as much more deserving of an early death from smallpox than his
                  wife. The audience feels a sense of satisfaction when Munny shoots
                  Little Bill, however that satisfaction is hindered by a sense
                  of uneasiness that is not present in the much more simplistic
                  good vs. evil of <i>King of the Pecos</i>. <br>
<br>
                  William Ian Miller in his paper, <i>Clint Eastwood and Equity:
                  Popular Culture's Theory of Revenge </i><a href="#footnotes">(3)</a>,
                  asserts a class-based analysis of revenge. He describes an &quot;antihonor,
                  antirevenge political and moral discourse&quot; in which revenge
                  has been rejected by the upper classes as being &quot;vulgar
                  and unfashionable&quot;. This is not to say, according to Miller,
                  that the upper classes were no longer concerned with getting
                  even, rather &quot;their revenges were transmuted and took place
                  in economic arenas and in routine social activities like gossip
                  and slighting rather than face-to-face confrontation.&quot; Miller
                  attributes much of this discourse to a distinction that developed
                  between revenge and retribution. While revenge came to be seen
                  as improper, retribution remained justifiable. The distinction
                  was premised on restitution being &quot;a respectable reason
                  for punishment of wrongs, administered as it must by the state
                  in a controlled, proportional fashion&quot;, while in contrast
                  revenge is &quot;portrayed as crazed, uncontrolled, subjective,
                  individual, admitting no reason, no rule of limitation.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  Miller discredits this view and contends that in fact, there
                  is no difference between revenge and retribution. The proponents
                  of this division are attempting to set up an actual philosophical
                  distinction. Their goal is to legitimate state punishment as
                  being retribution and in order to do this it had to be distanced
                  from revenge. Miller claims we are repressed, and revenge continues
                  to live inside of us as &quot;fantasies of getting even, of dominating,
                  of discomforting those we envy&quot;.<br>
<br>
                  One way we live out these fantasies is through the revenge genre
                  film, such as the two western films previously discussed. This
                  observation forces one to pose the question as to why the revenge
                  genre film so typically involves the one seeking reprisal taking
                  matters into their own hands rather than relying on the law.
                  An easy answer for the western film is that the setting of undeveloped
                  law enforcement dictates that this is the only way justice can
                  be upheld, however I would argue that a better answer would be
                  that it is the revenge genre that dictates the setting. The revenge
                  genre is best served by a setting where legal order is either
                  undeveloped, incompetent, corrupt, or most commonly some combination
                  thereof. The reason is that this allows the hero of the film
                  to seek out his revenge without being judged by the audience
                  as being &quot;vulgar and unfashionable&quot;, or perhaps more
                  appropriately, allows the audience to live out their fantasy
                  of revenge vicariously through the film without a sense of guilt
                  for their feelings of satisfaction. The film's avenger cannot
                  be judged for his acts of revenge, the lawless setting leaves
                  no alternative, and there is no state to administer 'retribution'.
<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/seven.jpg" width="150" height="214" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Perhaps a perfect contrasting
                  example to the revenge genre western is that of the film <i>Seven</i>.
                  The film is not a western, and thus does not take place amidst
                  a wild, untamed, and lawless setting, but rather in the present
                  day, legal-rule-filled modern world. The film follows a young
                  detective as he desperately tries to capture a ruthless killer
                  who is punishing each the seven deadly sins of gluttony, greed,
                  sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and lust by systematically murdering
                  those he sees as possessing them. In a dramatic conclusion, once
                  the killer is captured, he reveals to the detective that he has
                  murdered the young man's wife. The killer explains that since
                  he himself envied the normal life of the detective, it seemed
                  fair that he himself becomes the victim of envy. He then begs
                  the dispirited and anguished detective to give in to his anger
                  and desire for revenge by killing him on the spot, an obviously
                  illegal act by a peace officer in our justice system. The detective
                  tries desperately to fight his emotions, but he cannot restrain
                  his anger and eventually obliges by shooting the killer, becoming
                  the last of the victims, guilty of the sin of wrath. The final
                  scene shows the young detective being taken away in a police
                  car, certain to be disciplined by the justice system for his
                  act. The film <i>Seven</i> does not serve us as a revenge fantasy.
                  The audience, despite being sympathetic towards the detective,
                  is left with the feeling that he made a mistake by giving in
                  to his emotions and completing the killer's masterpiece of the
                  seven deadly sins, ruining his own life in the process. While
                  the first six sins, including that of envy by the serial killer
                  himself, were punished by murder, the seventh sin of wrath contained
                  in the young detective's revenge is punished by the law.<br>
<br>
                  The modern world is no place for revenge fuelled by emotion.
                  We expect our anger to be repressed; we consider it a sin when
                  it is not. One must ask why, then, we are continuously drawn
                  to revenge genre films to fulfill our fantasies of vengeance.
                  If we consider revenge to be so vulgar and unfashionable, why
                  do we feel such pleasure when the avenger is finally successful
                  at the end of the film, instead of scorning him for his crazed
                  and uncontrolled conduct? I feel much of an answer can be found
                  in the settings of these films. We are willing to forgive vengeful
                  conduct that takes place amidst an undeveloped legal system,
                  where there is no state to administer punishment in a controlled,
                  proportional fashion. But not in our modern world of judges and
                  lawyers, laws and courts that uphold them, all apparently free
                  of emotion. <br>
<br>
                  If one's conduct does not warrant anger or outrage, for what
                  are we punishing? When someone is asked whether justice was served,
                  do they not question whether they feel the guilty party got what
                  they deserved? The truth is that justice is as much an emotion
                  as it is a legal principle, as to inflict punishment for an act
                  that does not give rise in anyone a sense of anger or outrage
                  is the real sin. <hr align="LEFT"><br>
