                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Dressed in pink from head to
                  toe, she strolls down the street and is met with catcalls and
                  whistles. &quot;I object&quot; she declares. This is Elle Woods:
                  Harvard law student in <i>Legally Blonde</i>. How far off is
                  this image of the girly girl meets seriously smart law student?
                  This is the question that consumed my group of friends just the
                  other night as we watched <i>Legally Blonde</i>, feasting on
                  goodies, drinking wine, dressed in our pink Juicy Couture&#153;
                  sweatpants and other equally fashion-conscious choices. Were
                  we, female law students, just like Elle Woods? One couldn't help
                  but admit our gathering reflected similar gendered stereotypes
                  that <i>Legally Blonde</i> effused. Yet, somehow, none of us
                  wanted this comparison to be accurate. Which raises the question,
                  why do we so readily consume popular culture like <i>Legally
                  Blonde</i>, yet refuse the belief in any parallel? If a character
                  such as Elle Woods has no influence or credibility in our worlds,
                  why then do we see it reproduced and replicated as in the case
                  of Audrey Woods in <i>Laws of Attraction</i>? It's not simply
                  the shared last name - Elle and Audrey seem to be the modern
                  gold standard for the representation of women in the law. As
                  a divorce lawyer, Audrey Woods is not only exceptional in her
                  intellect, but also her appearance - akin to her student counterpart
                  Elle. This portrayal of women in the legal profession merits
                  analysis considering not only the pervasiveness of popular culture
                  but also the influence it has in informing our understanding
                  of the world we live in and who we are as women lawyers. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/legallyblonde.jpg" width="106" height="150" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The construction
                  of Elle and Audrey as women in these films seems to supersede
                  the portrayal of their capabilities in law. Although both attain
                  outstanding achievements in law, graduating top of their classes
                  at Harvard and Yale respectively, this is shadowed by the emphasis
                  on their femininity. Placing this emphasis hierarchically, femininity
                  reigns supreme while professional accomplishments rank inferior.
                  The obvious implication being that the importance of a woman
                  in law being stereotypically woman is not only desirable but
                  necessary. Whether this stems from a North American culture that
                  values outward appearances or a popular culture that perpetuates
                  stereotyped roles is debatable. Less controversial is the message
                  it sends - the premium on femininity is higher than that of legal
                  intellect or professional accomplishment. Perhaps the clearest
                  manifestation of this emphasis on femininity in both films is
                  in the physical representations. Elle and Audrey are exceptionally
                  beautiful women by modern (albeit stereotyped) standards. Both
                  women have long flowing hair, excellent make-up, perfect teeth,
                  slim physiques and clever fashionable outfits. <br>
                  The association between the color pink and notions of femininity
                  is neither subtle nor accidental in both films. Elle's and Audrey's
                  dress offers the extreme in femininity - most of the wardrobe
                  choices are pink. Pink is the ideal ultra-feminine color of choice.
                  It is not surprising therefore to see it used and abused in <i>Legally
                  Blonde</i> as well as, though less pervasively so, in <i>Laws
                  of Attraction</i>. Whereas Elle's use of pink borders on the
                  unpalatable, Audrey's wardrobe suggests the same affinity without
                  the embellishment. This physical manifestation of the feminine
                  serves to reinforce the very make-up of these characters. Make
                  no mistake about it - these women are not seen wearing the traditional
                  legal garb, yet at the same time they do not eschew traditional
                  notions of femininity. On the contrary, their wardrobes embrace
                  all that is feminine from the pink suits to the lacy undergarments.
<br>
<br>
                  The heightened physical portrayal of femininity in these films
                  is without a doubt matched by the decidedly female characteristics
                  of Elle and Audrey. Commonly held beliefs of the stereotypical
                  women are often seen in contrast to the opposite sex: Women are
                  more emotional than men, women are more concerned with fashion
                  than men, women are more neurotic about food than men, women
                  are more inclined to obsess about intimate and personal relationships
                  than men and women are just simply less competent than men. These
                  conceptions are clearly delivered in both films. <br>
<br>
                  In <i>Legally Blonde</i>, Elle turns on the tears on several
                  occasions, primarily in relation to her heart's affection - Warner.
                  Their romantic break-up causes Elle to spin into the stereotypical
                  emotional meltdown women go through after being dumped: Elle
                  spends a week in bed, eating chocolates and watching soap opera's.
                  Beyond majoring in fashion at university, Elle takes her wardrobe
                  choices very seriously. From her dedication to manicures and
                  Cosmopolitan magazine, Elle is always put together and chic.
                  Yet, even Elle's mastery of fashion is trivialized in the film
                  - her lavishness and colorful couture is only matched by her
                  purse-pocket dog Bruiser who is seen wearing a barrage of doggy-sized
                  outfits. Interestingly enough, as Elle begins to achieve academically,
                  the film shows her toning down her otherwise gaudy wardrobe.
                  This suggests that even femininity has its limits - but only
                  to the extent that there can be too much of a good thing. As
                  Naomi Wolf suggests in <i>The Beauty Myth</i>, &quot;Femininity
                  is code for femaleness, plus whatever a society happens to be
                  selling&quot;. Current popular culture informs our ideas of femininity
                  and what limits should be placed on a woman and her femaleness
                  - we accept and embrace Elle's femininity, but as soon as she
                  emerges as a contender in the academic game, we hold her to a
                  different standard. Her over-the-top-ness is no longer acceptable
                  - she must now exude control and togetherness in order for us
                  to believe that she can actually think. Wolf continues to state
                  that, &quot;[women] are raised to compete like men in rigid male-model
                  institutions, [women] must also maintain to the last detail impeccable
                  femininity&quot; This sentiment reinforces the importance of
                  femininity, particularly in male centered institutions, the law
                  being a prime example. <br>
<br>
                  Elle's decision to go to law school stems not from her desire
                  to become a lawyer, but rather to get her boyfriend back. And
                  even when Elle eventually realizes Warner is not 'the one', he
                  is quickly replaced by another man. Elle seems to gain credibility
                  in the audience's eyes by fulfilling the popular stereotype of
                  'girl lands boy and they live happily ever after'. Again, it
                  is not enough for Elle to have graduated law school, been Valedictorian
                  of her class, and secured an articling position at a prestigious
                  law firm - these truths are eclipsed by the importance of Elle's
                  femininity. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/attraction.jpg" width="114" height="168" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In <i>Laws of Attraction</i>,
                  Audrey attempts confidence and determination in the film yet
                  her emotions get the best of her at several points. When opposing
                  counsel changes in Audrey's case, we witness her in the bathroom
                  at the courthouse, shoving a snowball (a pink sweet) into her
                  mouth in a moment of anxiety and fear. Throughout the film, the
                  audience engages in her struggle to maintain composure in and
                  out of the courtroom with less than subtle hints as to what lies
                  beneath the surface. These emotions emerge predominantly in her
                  dealings with Daniel Raferty, the other divorce lawyer in the
                  film. Audrey's emotional being is most obvious in contrast to
                  her leading man. Daniel consistently fulfills the opposite stereotype
                  - that of a cool and collected male whose emotions don't come
                  as a sacrifice to his competence or control. <br>
<br>
                  Audrey's fashion sense and the importance thereof is seen not
                  only through her dress, but also in her remarks to Daniel. She
                  frequently comments on his lack of attention to his wardrobe
                  and at one point buys him a tie. And even though Audrey may appear
                  to derive an element of capability from her fashion know-how,
                  the film makes it clear that this doesn't really matter - dressing
                  well does not win court cases. Audrey's neuroticism is portrayed
                  through food, her weakness with sugar and sneaking of goodies,
                  but also generally as in her rigidity in the courtroom needing
                  to have her paper and markers laid out just so. Audrey's incompetence,
                  particularly in contrast to Daniel, permeates the film. Initially
                  she is clearly caught off guard by newly appointed opposing counsel
                  (Daniel) and rightly so - her motion was ill-informed and embarrassing.
                  The film continues this theme from Audrey losing her star client
                  to Daniel to her inability to rent a car in Ireland (but of course
                  she is later on rescued by Daniel). On the surface, the film
                  could seem to portray a woman lawyer in a position of power at
                  her firm, with great successes, loads of confidence who is all
                  too happy to be alone. As the film unravels however, the audience
                  is shown that this is all just a fa&ccedil;ade for who Audrey
                  really is - a lonely, vulnerable woman who desperately wants
                  the love of a man. <br>
<br>
                  The roles of Elle and Audrey Woods in both films are not entirely
                  devoid of positive factors. Both leading ladies are portrayed
                  as successful, ambitious and professional women. While this has
                  tremendous appeal for me and other women in law school, what
                  is difficult to digest is the message these films are sending
                  - that although academic achievements and legal prowess are important,
                  it is more important to attain and display a certain degree of
                  femininity. This is not to say that all women in law must be
                  over-the-top feminine to reach their goals, but popular culture
                  suggests that an element of femininity is necessary in and above
                  any other successes. As Naomi Wolf points out &quot;the more
                  legal and material hindrances women have broken through, the
                  more strictly and heavily and cruelly images of female beauty
                  have come to weigh upon us&quot; (<a href="#footnote">1</a>)
                  . This is neither a new nor shocking message - cultural socialization
                  taught us at a young age that women are supposed to look/be pretty
                  not look/be smart. And even though the times are changing such

                  that many women are entering traditionally male-dominated professions
                  such as law, both <i>Legally Blonde</i> and <i>Laws of Attraction</i>
                  make me wonder how far we've really come. <hr align="LEFT"></font><br>
