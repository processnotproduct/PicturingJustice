                  By Katie Lula<br>
<br>
                  Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli believed war for a government is inevitable
                  because either others wish to govern our government or others
                  fear our desire to govern theirs. Necessity requires a government
                  go to war, although at the beginning of the <i>STAR WARS</i>
                  prequels, heroine Padm&eacute; refused to condone any course
                  of action that would lead to war and argued that if the galaxy
                  went to war, <i>&quot;Many will lose their lives, all will lose
                  their freedom.&quot; </i>Later, Anakin Skywalker and she discussed
                  the dangers of war, embodied by the civil war consuming the galaxy:<br>
<br>
                  <i>ANAKIN: &#133;I think this war is destroying the principles
                  of the Republic. PADM&Eacute;: Have you ever considered that
                  we may be on the wrong side?&#133;What if the democracy we thought
                  we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become
                  the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?&#133;[T]his war
                  represents a failure to listen . . . </i><br>
<br>
                  Yet war is inevitable: when government organized with a view
                  to its internal stability eventually goes to war and manages
                  to maintain its independence in war for any length of time, the
                  burden of its resulting empire, which it cannot manage given
                  its original infrastructure, will result in its downfall. Even
                  if such a government could avoid war entirely, such peace would
                  engender faction, resulting ultimately in the same lamentable
                  outcome as war successfully prosecuted for the government ill-prepared
                  for empire. This was the problem in <i>STAR WARS</i>: the Galactic
                  Republic was too big and too stable. Its peace engendered faction,
                  which resulted in civil war. One character observed in disbelief,
                  <i>&quot;It's unthinkable. There hasn't been a full-scale war
                  since the formation of the Republic,&quot;</i> though Palpatine
                  himself hinted that civil war was inevitable: <i>&quot;I will
                  not let this Republic which has stood for a thousand years be
                  split in two.&quot;</i><br>
<br>
                  Machiavelli's &quot;faction&quot; naturally stems from corruption:
                  the common people's refusal to put the common good before their
                  individual private benefits. The threat of such corruption to
                  a government, however, lies not with the common people, but with
                  the ambitious few in a government, who-if the government is to
                  survive-should not be permitted to gather common people with
                  promises of private benefits. Machiavelli refused to blame people
                  if they look to someone who promises them relief and rewards,
                  for naturally people will respond to such promises.<br>
<br>
                  The mortal threat to a government occurs when people come together
                  around one individual, raising that individual over his or her
                  rivals and creating dangerous political inequality and thus faction,
                  which, of course, leads to war. While people look to this ambitious
                  individual to easily satisfy their desires with private favors
                  such as helping them with money or defending them from others,
                  the ulterior motive of the individual who offers such favors,
                  of course, is to make partisans, who will make him leader over
                  the government; in other words, partisans give rise to tyranny.
                  In Robert Bolt's <i>A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS</i>, the villain Cromwell
                  explained the concept of partisans-and bureaucracy:<br>
<br>
                  <i>&quot;It's much more a matter of convenience, administrative
                  convenience. The normal aim of administration is to keep steady
                  this factor of convenience&#133;Now normally when a man wants
                  to change his woman, you let him if it's convenient and prevent
                  him if it's not - normally indeed it's of so little importance
                  that you leave it to the priests. But the constant factor is
                  this element of convenience&#133; However, in the present instance
                  the man who wants to change his woman is our Sovereign Lord,
                  Harry, by the Grace of God, the Eighth of that name. Which is
                  a quaint way of saying that if he wants to change his woman he
                  will. So that becomes the constant factor. And our job as administrators
                  is to make it as convenient as we can&#133;&quot;</i><br>
<br>
                  This is the core horror of corruption: all it takes is one person
                  to enact a government's ruin; as Galadriel, Elven Queen of J.R.R.
                  Tolkien's <i>LORD OF THE RINGS</i>, acknowledged: <i>&quot;Even
                  the smallest person can change the course of the future.&quot;</i>
                  In order to remain free of corruption, much less survive, a government
                  must concentrate on its leaders and ensure that political equality
                  is maintained among them. Corruption must be managed: easier
                  said than done, but an answer. As war breeds corruption, and
                  corruption breeds war, they are causes and not excuses for the
                  inevitable tyranny that follows them.<br>
<br>
                  To save a corrupted government, Machiavelli demanded complete
                  renovation, a new law and order. This sounds like revolution,
                  a dangerous creature, as a speech in Bolt's play illustrated:<br>
<br>
                  <i>MORE: &quot;What would you do? Cut a great road through the
                  law to get after the Devil?&#133;[W]hen the last law was down,
                  and the Devil turned round on you-where would you hide, Roper,
                  the laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws
                  from coast to coast-man's laws, not God's-and if you cut them
                  down-and you're just the man to do it-d'you really think you
                  could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?&quot;</i><br>
<br>
                  Regardless, Machiavelli believed salvation must originate from
                  a single &quot;virtuous&quot; individual: a hero, in modern-day
                  lingo. If a government that has fallen into decline through corruption
                  is to rise again, it can only rise through the virtue of one
                  individual, either a reformer of a very long life or two virtuous
                  ones continued in succession. The individual must become leader
                  through ordinary procedure, however corrupt that procedure may
                  be so long as it is legitimate, but then he or she must use extraordinary
                  means, even repugnant means, to correct the government and make
                  the sweeping changes necessary to restore it and purge it of
                  its corruption. When the deed accuses him, the effect excuses
                  him.<br>
<br>
                  In <i>STAR WARS</i>, this was where Palpatine went wrong. He
                  became Chancellor in a completely legitimate way, but his governmental
                  reform enacted afterwards rather had the effect of permeating
                  the Galactic Republic's ills, although the changes were prima
                  facie designed to renovate the Galactic Republic: <i>&quot;In
                  order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic
                  will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe
                  and secure society&#133;An empire that will continue to be ruled
                  by [the Senate], and a sovereign ruler chosen for life&#133;An
                  empire ruled by the majority&#133;ruled by a new constitution.&quot;</i>
                  Whatever the galaxy, an empire is never the same thing as a democracy.<br>
<br>
                  However, two closely-related problems for the virtuous individual
                  arise, one come from the corrupted government and another coming
                  from the individual. First, in Bolt's <i>A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS</i>,
                  the Common Man observed, <i>&quot;It isn't difficult to keep
                  alive, friends - just don't make trouble - or if you must make
                  trouble, make the sort of trouble that's expected.&quot; </i>The
                  virtuous individual might die if he tries to rescue his government
                  form itself, for a corrupted government, though needing desperately
                  to be saved, naturally doesn't want to be saved from itself.
                  Corruption likes corruption, and it will try to destroy anything
                  and anyone contrary to it.<br>
<br>
                  Second, if an individual knows what a government needs to amend
                  its corruption, he or she may not be able to achieve it without
                  sacrificing the very principles that render him or her the virtuous
                  savior. Because the proper reordering of a government for a political
                  way of life presupposes a good individual, and becoming prince
                  or emperor of a government by violence presupposes a bad individual,
                  the good individual will never become prince or emperor by bad
                  ways, even though his end is to do good, for the bad individual,
                  having become prince or emperor by bad ways, will never think
                  to use for good the authority that he or she has acquired badly.<br>
<br>
                  In <i>STAR WARS</i>, perverting that distinction was what made
                  Palpatine so evil: having come to power entirely through legitimate
                  means, he should have been presupposed a good man, but his entire
                  motivation was to put himself into a secure position where he
                  could abuse at will the authority he had acquired so goodly:
                  he wanted to become a tyrant all along.<br>
<br>
                  For the truly virtuous individual to save a corrupted government,
                  he or she must be placed in power by others. A virtuous individual,
                  to save a corrupted government, cannot save it until he or she
                  is called to do so. He or she must feel forced that this path
                  is placed before them, and no other path exists, nor can anyone
                  else rightly walk it. As Galadriel noted of heroes, <i>&quot;If
                  [they] do not find a way, no one will.&quot;</i><br>
<br>
                  However, once a corrupted government has fallen but is replaced
                  by a democracy, is it possible for that democracy to succumb
                  to similar events, forces, and people that fell the original
                  government? Democracy has sometimes been expected by some people
                  to be the golden solution, to succeed in every area where all
                  other forms of government failed. This is an impossible expection
                  of perfection, and for democracy to fall short is, however natural,
                  nevertheless disappointing.<br>
<br>
                  The fundamental cause of democratic decline in contemporary politics
                  is the major imbalance now developing between the role of corporate
                  interests and those of virtually all other groups. Taken alongside
                  the inevitable entropy of democracy, this is leading to politics
                  once again becoming an affair of closed elites, as it was in
                  non-democratic governments. Changes are so powerful and widespread
                  that it is impossible to see any major reversal of them. It leads
                  us to say the fall of democracy is inevitable because it is already
                  falling.<br>
<br>
                  In <i>STAR WARS</i>, Anakin and Padm&eacute; shared a conversation
                  exemplifying how easily a democratic government can fall to become
                  a non-democratic government simply due to complacency with the
                  reality of democracy's failures and acceptance of the impossibility
                  of its ideal model:<br>
<br>
                  <i>ANAKIN: I don't think the system works&#133;We need a system
                  where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem, agree
                  what's in the best interest of all the people, and then do it.<br>
                  PADM&Eacute;: That's exactly what we do. The trouble is that
                  people don't always agree.<br>
                  ANAKIN: Well, then, they should be made to.<br>
                  PADM&Eacute;: By whom? Who's going to make them?<br>
                  ANAKIN: I don't know&#133;Someone wise.<br>
                  PADM&Eacute;: Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.<br>
                  ANAKIN: Well, if it works&#133;</i><br>
<br>
                  America is undergoing a process of fundamental change, though
                  exactly where it will lead is uncertain. The 2000 presidential
                  election foreshadows the coming of ambitious individuals to America
                  as a stronger embodiment of what has already begun. The growing
                  complexity of issues has made it increasingly difficult for people
                  to have informed positions, make intelligent comment, or even
                  know what &quot;side&quot; they are or should be on. Participation
                  in political organizations declines; voting is apathetic. Like
                  Palpatine, then just a Senator in <i>STAR WARS</i>, observed,
                  <i>&quot;There is no civility, only politics. The Republic is
                  not what it once was. The Senate is full of greedy, squabbling
                  delegates. There is no interest in the common good&#133;The bureaucrats
                  are in charge now.&quot;</i><br>
<br>
                  It may not be too long before America-and democracy-suffers an
                  accumulation of events, forces, and people similar to or at least
                  with the same strength of that which fell Rome. Taking a snapshot
                  of where and what we are now, in 2006, gives us no picture of
                  what lies in store, but if we put that snapshot in an album,
                  in context of history, we might see a pattern and a path. War
                  has already begun: the current war in Iraq may not be enough,
                  but it need not be. There was Bosnia, Somalia, the Gulf War,
                  the Vietnam War, the Korean War. There has been dissent-the feminist
                  movement, Civil Rights protests-and there has been corruption:
                  Watergate, Whitewater, Clinton's impeachment. The corruption
                  has been somewhat managed and controlled, but if efforts to manage
                  it fail, and extraordinarily, irreparable catastrophe and damage
                  result, soon someone might echo Padm&eacute;'s cold words: <i>&quot;I
                  was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss
                  this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of
                  action, then I suggest new leadership is needed&#133; It is clear
                  to me now that the Republic no longer functions. I pray [that
                  someone] will bring sanity and compassion back to [democracy].&quot;</i>
                  Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California, seemed to be along
                  Padm&eacute;'s line of thinking when he called for a special
                  election to be held in November 2005 to continue dramatic reformation
                  of the state's government and finances, saying, <i>&quot;I did
                  not come to Sacramento, and [the people] did not send me here,
                  to repeat the mistakes of the past.&quot;</i></font></p>
