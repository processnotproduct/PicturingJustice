                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">&quot;I don't believe in
                  happy endings, but I do believe in happy travels, because ultimately......you
                  die at a very young age, or you live long enough to watch your
                  friends die. It's a mean thing, life.&quot; <br>
                  -<a href="http://www.gclooney.com/quotes.html">George Clooney</a></font></i></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">From the competitive mix of
                  entertainment formats, and its need to feed, quick sequels, and
                  formulaic updates of film have become mainstream money grabbers.
                  There are some subtle changes taking place, however. Recent film
                  fashion appears to favor quality, along with personal reflections
                  of life and culture. This has created a third vision, a Meta-forum
                  in film, similar to the web's bloggers. It is a new version of
                  &quot;pastiche,&quot; a genre of film as a centralized compilation
                  of many opinions and ideas, some mass media popular, some not
                  that abound in our civilization. <br>
<br>
                  The unleashing of digital technology has compressed and stylized
                  other cultures and every generation gap, making them just ripe
                  for &quot;pastiche films.&quot; Their imagery does the translating
                  for us, to allow an easy access and understanding of those experiences.
                  Our differences co-mingle inside these movies inside other movies,
                  which revolve around older movies to affect and inspire them.
                  As filmmakers continue to script into the industry's memorable
                  classics, in this case <i>The Graduate</i>, they will keep actors
                  in jobs amidst their digital displacement. <br>
<br>
                  &quot;Pastiches&quot; can clarify our history, what is happening
                  to us, of what we think about. It an aggregate form of free speech
                  and storytelling that can eliminate political correctness as
                  a fear (finally!). And, in its initial present anarchic state,
                  cause myriad other first amendment issues (too much personalization
                  can be a bad thing). Demand for more &quot;pastiches&quot; may
                  be the impetus to lead the vox populi to mainstream video logs
                  (vlogs), moblogs (sound-bitesized vlogs), and info snacks (media
                  trailers of artists, celebrities, and TV shows). All of these
                  can be a major source of ideas for a &quot;pastiche.&quot; And
                  over time the &quot;pastiche&quot; can evolve to replace other
                  genres of films. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/rumorhasit.jpg" width="97" height="140" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><i>Rumor Has It</i> is supposedly
                  based upon a true rumor of a Pasadena CA family, and is the first
                  film I have seen that has made me laugh about all these changes.
                  Written by Ted Griffin, it is refreshing to see a lawyer, Jeff
                  Daly (an attentive, human Mark Ruffalo), that actually has a
                  life outside his work. Director Rob Reiner again uses his elegant
                  touch to provoke lasting fun from a single idea as he did in
                  <i>When Harry Met Sally</i> (written by Nora Ephron). The pleasant
                  surprise is that it works as well as <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>
                  (directed by Nora Ephron). And, happily, the all-star cast invites
                  us cineastes, into their &quot;pastiche&quot; as a friend. It
                  reveals that good things can come from facing our troubles openly
                  and honestly. That we can change by knowing how we got to be
                  who we are.<br>
<br>
                  The lead is prodigal daughter Sarah Huttinger (a funny, vulnerable
                  Jennifer Anniston). She and fianc&eacute; Jeff attend the wedding
                  of her sister Annie (perky, spoiled Mena Suvari) and Scott (sweet,
                  silent Steve Sandvoss) to discover her grandmother, Katharine
                  Richelieu (an affably raucous Shirley MacLaine), is the real
                  Mrs. Robinson. She finds out from her Aunt Betsy (a kinder, gentler
                  Kathy Bates) about the real Benjamin Braddock, rich dropout Beau
                  Burroughs (a horny yet suave Kevin Costner). He had slept with
                  her deceased mother and might be her father. She feels this could
                  explain why she feels alienated from her family all these years.
                  Her travels take her back home to her father, Earl Huttinger
                  (protective, loving Richard Jenkins), who ultimately gives her
                  all the answers she needs. And from a year of great loss provides
                  us with a healing ending we all need.</font></p>
