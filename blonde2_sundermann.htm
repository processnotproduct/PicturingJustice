                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Legally Blonde 2: Red, White
                  and Blonde</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">, the sequel
                  to <i>Legally Blonde</i>, is another example of why sequels have
                  gotten such a bad reputation. Reese Witherspoon reprises her
                  role as Elle Woods and goes from Barbie goes to law school to
                  Barbie goes to Congress. In my review of the first film, I said
                  that if you could suspend belief a little, the film was good
                  fun and Ms. Witherspoon's performance was terrific. But in this
                  film, the plot is so silly and such a rip- off from the first
                  film that you would have to suspend belief to a whole new level.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/blonde3.jpg" width="207" height="139" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The plot, such as it is, has Elle
                  graduating from law school and working for a large law firm in
                  Boston. As she is searching for the birth mother of her dog,
                  she stumbles upon the cause of protecting animals from being
                  used in cosmetic testing. Because of this, she is fired from
                  her law firm and winds up as a legislative aide for a congresswoman
                  in Washington D.C. There she leads a fight to pass a bill outlawing
                  such testing. She meets the other staff members of the office,
                  and they don't take her seriously, similar to her fellow law
                  students in the first film. In <i>Legally Blonde</i> Elle demonstrated
                  a first class brain behind her superficial exterior, but she
                  exhibits no such ability in this film. She seems to have no idea
                  what she is doing, and by this time we don't care. Didn't she
                  see the first movie?<br>
<br>
                  The plot is loosely based on a good film, <i>Mr. Smith goes to
                  Washington</i> (1939), and in case you don't get this, they work
                  in a brief clip of the film. The film takes a view of Congress
                  that would be taken in a bad sitcom. I was so happy that the
                  film was finally concluding that I almost missed the most inane
                  part. Elle gives a speech to a joint session of Congress. A legislative
                  aide doing this, give me a break. On top of that, the speech
                  is so stupid it looks like an outtake from the <i>Gong Show</i>.
                  I kept expecting a large hook to remove her from the podium.
                  But, of course, the congressmen cheered wildly and Elle wins
                  the day.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In a side plot, Elle's principal
                  political advisor, who seems to know everything about politics,
                  is the doorman at her apartment building, well played by Bob
                  Newhart. How did he learn all of this? It is explained that he
                  hears things around the door. I advise you to save the eight
                  dollars for the ticket and join me in doing everything possible
                  to prevent <i>Legally Blonde 3</i>. <br>
