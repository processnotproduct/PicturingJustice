                  PORTRAYAL OF WOMEN IN THE MEDIA</font></b><font size="-1" face="Verdana"></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Megan Terrell</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As if the depiction of women
                  lawyers in the media hasn't been bad enough, Fox recently introduced
                  a new series into the mix, <i>Girls Club</i>.  This hour long
                  drama, although only one episode into its first season, which
                  is hopefully its last, is morally repulsive to say the least.
                   I was not only deeply offended by the show, but also extremely
                  disappointed.  The executive producer/writer turned what could
                  have potentially been a great topic and television show into
                  a professional women's worst nightmare.  The amount of respect
                  women attorneys  get now, which is often times very little, has
                  been amazingly lessened in the mind of any male who happened
                  to watch the show. <br>
                   <br>
                  <img src="images/girlsclub.jpg" width="126" height="217" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><i>Girls Club</i> attempts to
                  tackle the trials and tribulations of three up-and-coming female
                  associates in what is perceived to be a medium-sized law firm.
                   Jeanne, Lynn, and Sarah, the three main characters, are roommates
                  who attended law school together and most recently work together.
                   The first episode tackles several hurdles that women professionals
                  often must jump during their careers, most of which are handled
                  inappropriately by the show. <br>
<br>
                  First, Jeanne is sexually harassed by one of the male partners
                  in the firm.  She is hugged, touched, fondled, asked out, and
                  treated in an altogether demeaning fashion.  The partner's initial
                  advances are shrugged off by the character, who by the end of
                  the show is extremely distraught and in tears.  The partner is
                  of course a married man.  Although sexual harassment is an unfortunate
                  reality women must sometimes face, television shows have a tendency
                  to play down the seriousness of the crime.  It will be interesting
                  to see how <i>Girls Club</i> deals with the situation during
                  the next few episodes.  I can only hope it will be handled in
                  a more tasteful and serious manner than the encounters of the
                  first episode were; I personally won't know as I doubt I will
                  tune in to <i>Girls Club</i> next week.<br>
<br>
                  Second, Lynn is portrayed as a somewhat incompetent lawyer who
                  lacks confidence in her professional abilities.  For instance,
                  she is seen at the beginning of the show writing and rewriting
                  her opening statement, and then practicing repeatedly for her
                  roommates/colleagues.  She appears nervous and unsure of herself.
                   Later, we see her practicing again in front of the bathroom
                  mirror, and again looking flustered and frustrated.  I do recognize
                  that attorneys, both women and men, are often nervous before
                  courtroom appearances, especially their first courtroom experience,
                  and that these routines are commonplace.  As a second year law
                  student myself, I can usually be found in front of a mirror the
                  day before I am due to give an oral argument.  However, male
                  attorneys are rarely, if ever, shown second guessing themselves.
                   When is the last time a man is depicted as lacking in confidence
                  and questioning his abilities in his role as an attorney?  I
                  personally cannot think of such a thing ever happening.  Male
                  attorneys are instead depicted as having the utmost confidence
                  in their abilities; I might even go so far as to call it a &quot;God-like&quot;
                  complex, although this is usually seen as heroic.  Lynn's goal
                  in the first episode is apparently to not let the men get the
                  best of her and is made clear by her dialogue with a male partner,
                  &quot;If you want to make me cry, it won't work&quot;.  She says
                  this on the verge of tears after getting lectured on her courtroom
                  mistakes.<br>
<br>
                  Finally, and most appalling, the women are seen throughout the
                  show gossiping, bickering, and complaining about their fellow
                  employees.  This is often done in an office or room with the
                  door wide open so that everyone can be made aware of their unprofessional
                  conduct as if it is expected.  They refer to the male partners
                  as &quot;dicks&quot; and the female partner as a &quot;praying
                  mantis&quot;.  It is as if women cannot accept the hierarchy
                  of the workplace and must find a way to belittle others in a
                  higher position in order to make themselves feel better.  In
                  fact, the women are supposed to be lower on the totem pole because
                  they are newly hired associates, fresh out of law school.  Everyone
                  must start somewhere, but in order to climb the ladder of success
                  one must work hard and be professional, not bitch and complain.
                   And I should point out that most women are quite capable of
                  climbing that ladder, as capable as their male counterparts,
                  but one would not know this if their only encounter with women
                  attorneys was the portrayal of them on television and elsewhere
                  in the media spotlight.<br>
<br>
                  In <i>Girls Club</i> Sarah is shown whining and squabbling with
                  another female associate, not one of the three main characters.
                   She is upset because the partner chose the other woman to take
                  the lead in handling a new case, a case that Sarah claims she
                  deserves because she brought in the client.  The partners see
                  the other associates as the better attorney for the job; however,
                  Sarah is convinced she was tricked and swindled out of the job.
                   This portrays women as petty and unable to accept when others
                  have proved themselves to be more capable than they are.  <br>
<br>
                  In fact, the most disturbing part of the show comes when Sarah
                  confronts the other associate about her suspicions of being sabotaged
                  out of the job.  She rants and raves for a minute or two and
                  then shockingly calls the associate a name-[a negative slang
                  which is unfortunately used by some when referring to a lesbian,
                  but which I have more respect than to use myself].  She quickly
                  apologizes, &quot;I'm so sorry.  I don't know where that came
                  from.  I mean, I love homosexuals.&quot;  This is a poor attempt
                  at a punch line and an extremely insensitive way to handle a
                  delicate topic.  The use of this word during the show, which
                  has hateful and violent connotations in the real world, is used
                  in such a way to show that professional women are unable to accept
                  defeat.  Although the writer may have intended other messages
                  from this dialogue, it was done in a much too disgusting way
                  that it portrayed nothing but stupidity and ignorance.  In reality
                  and in spite of what some may think, women are not this immature.
                   But is does suit the media to portray us as such for ratings,
                  while at the same time portraying professional males as heroes
                  and people to be respected.<br>
<br>
                  In sum, <i>Girls Club</i> portrays women as bickering, incompetent,
                  emotion-driven sex symbols who can't keep their personal attitudes
                  outside of the office.  When defeated, women must resort to name
                  calling and &quot;bitching&quot;.  This, I hate to inform the
                  general public, is not the way most women handle themselves professionally.
                   We are every bit as capable as out male counterparts to function
                  civilly in a professional environment, despite how the media
                  likes to depict us.  I would dare to challenge writers and producers
                  to create a show in which reality might actually become truthful
                  on television. <br>
