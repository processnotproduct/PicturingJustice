                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I can only view the Irish film
                  <i>Evelyn</i> through the eyes of an Irish-American, a fact which
                  probably makes it a different film for me than for other viewers.
                  Most viewers will judge it a charming little confection just
                  right for consumption during the holiday season. And I readily
                  admit that it is a heart-warming tale of a family overcoming
                  hardship to share in the inevitable happy ending.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/evelyn4.jpg" width="200" height="132" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">But
                  I think an online journal on law and popular culture might point
                  out an aspect of the film not likely to be discussed in the most
                  reviews. On the popular culture front, it's important to note
                  how much the film's &quot;heartwarming effect&quot; is the product
                  of the cynical recycling of stereotypes about the Irish. I'll
                  just mention three to illustrate my point.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">We have early in the movie
                  the appearance of the virile, yet asexual priest, who is equally
                  adept with a quip or a left hook. Here he decks the protagonist
                  and then ministers to him physically and spiritually. I bet he
                  also croons a mean &quot;Danny Boy.&quot; This type cleric is
                  a throwback to Bing Crosby in &quot;The Bells of St. Mary's&quot;
                  and I am sure it is a comfort to Catholics in these times of
                  priestly travail. He's a positive stereotype, but no less a stereotype
                  for that.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Secondly, we have the drunken
                  legal scholar whose love of the law is only matched by his love
                  of the bottle. In <i>Evelyn</i>, Alan Bates plays a retired law
                  professor who temporarily overcomes his weakness for the drink
                  to concoct the legal theory which brings Evelyn back to her family.
                  This, you will recall, is exactly the same role that Jimmy Stewart's
                  Irish- American sidekick Parnell McCarthy played in <i>Anatomy
                  of a Murder</i>. The Irish and whiskey is a comic combination
                  that Irish-American John Ford made a Hollywood cliche and <i>Evelyn</i>
                  plays it to the hilt. In fact, most of the male characters seem
                  to be either alcoholics or reformed alcoholics. It would be refreshing
                  to see an Irishman with a cocaine problem for a change.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Finally, there is Holy Mother
                  Church. The Church in <i>Evelyn</i> is mainly represented by
                  two nuns in the orphanage where Evelyn is sent. One is is a direct
                  descendant of Loretta Young in <i>Come to the Stable</i>. She's
                  pretty, bright, warm-hearted, and, above all, fun-loving. The
                  other has a less well-documented history in Hollywood films,
                  but represents a type growing in popularity as the Church continues
                  to lose its influence on its portrayal in popular culture. She
                  is a new incarnation of the Wicked Witch of the West in <i>The
                  Wizard of Oz</i>. Not only is she cruel and violent; she also
                  no fun at all. We might say that <i>Evelyn</i> portrays Ireland
                  as the Isle of Saints and Sadists.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Of course, if popular culture
                  didn't employ popular stereotypes it would quickly become unpopular
                  culture. We rely on generalizations to interpret a plot and stock
                  stereotypes make the viewer's job a lot easier. It will always
                  be with us. So it doesn't make sense to watch and write about
                  popular film with too critical an eye. But perhaps we can keep
                  reminding ourselves every time we see film depictions of groups
                  we personally know little about ( Arabs come to mind) that it's
                  just a movie.</font></p>
