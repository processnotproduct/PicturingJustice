            unrealistic lawyer films,  therefore can provide an important
            supplement to the curriculum by teaching some important lessons.
             The most important lesson is that justice counts. The very quantity
            of 'law' films demonstrates that the human appetite for justice
            is just as strong as our appetites for power and sex.  </font></center></p>

            <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">What Movies Teach Law Students</font></b></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by John Denvir</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">We happily note that more and
            more law schools are using films in their curriculum. For instance,
            here at USF Law School, we are including extended discussions
            of the film <i>A Civil Action</i> in  our orientation program
            for first year students.  Now that the study of film has entered
            the law school curriculum, perhaps it's time to ask exactly what
            it  adds to the  student's educational experience that the traditional
            curriculum lacks.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/civilaction.gif" width="96" height="140" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">First,
            I think we have to admit that films about lawyers do not give
            a very accurate picture of how lawyers actually spend their days.
             First of all, most of lawyer films feature trial lawyers while
            most practicing lawyers seldom see a courtroom.  Secondly, the
            most common lawyer  film, like <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>,
             usually tells the story about the idealistic lawyer who represents
            an innocent person falsely accused of crime.  Practicing criminal
            defense attorneys even admit that truly innocent defendants make
            up a very small share of their clientele.  And finally we also
            must admit that movies and television take a great deal of artistic
            license with procedural rules, thereby diluting any claim that
            these fictions  show students how law actually plays out in a
            courtroom.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But even if we can't claim
            verisimilitude for lawyer films and have to confess that lawyer
            films tend to oversimplify messy reality in their pursuit of
            a clear battle between good (idealistic lawyer) and evil (corrupt
            system),  I think we can still persuasively argue that the study
            of movies provides an  important antidote to the excessively
            amoral &quot;professional&quot; model of lawyering that infects
            the rest of the curriculum.  </font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If the typical lawyer movie
            highlights the human desire for a  'just' result with little
            interest in procedural niceties, the professional model concerns
            itself primarily with procedures. It assumes that procedural
            justice will yield substantive justice, but this assumption ignores
            the fact that when the legal resources needed to work the system
            are not allocated on a basis even approaching equality, injustice
            is often the result.  Procedural justice might yield justice
            in a society in which all citizens had equal access to the top-flight
            lawyers, but this necessary condition is clearly not present
            in even our most wealthy societies.   For instance, in <i>A Civil
            Action</i>, the plaintiffs fail in their suit against two large
            companies who allegedly have dumped  toxics into the town's drinking
            water not because they had the lesser case in law and fact, but
            because the defendants had the larger bankroll.  <br>
              <br>
            A second element of the professional model is related to this
            procedural bias; it holds that we must put our faith in procedures
            because there are simply no substantively 'right' answers&quot;
            in difficult cases, only arguments which favor plaintiff or defendant.<br>
<br>
            Convincing law students of the truth of the 'no truth' thesis
             seems to be one of the major goals of the first year law school
            curriculum. Students must abandon 'fuzzy' thinking and accept
            that truth and justice are chimeras.  Here's how one law student
            put it: <br>
            &quot;<i>I made certain na&iuml;ve emotional and political arguments
            before law that I no longer buy into. Part of me feels, well,
            there are certain things that are just right and wrong and then
            there's another part of me that says, well, wait a minute, things
            aren't that simple in the real world and you really can't go
            around making silly emotional arguments about what's right and
            wrong.</i>&quot; <a href="#quote">1</a></font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But the fact that the truth
            is sometimes difficult to determine does not mean that there
            is no truth, nor does it mean that all resolutions of a dispute
            have a equal claim to the adjective 'just'. The primary goal
            of a legal system should be to design systems that allow the
            true facts to emerge in complicated situations.  </font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Worse yet, students are led
            to believe that their earlier faith in 'emotional arguments'
            is a sign of intellectual immaturity and that adoption of the
            value-free professional model is a form of personal progress.
            I would suggest that (again  to use the facts in <i>A Civil Action</i>
            as an example)  whether or not the defendant corporations polluted
            the water that the  plaintiffs drank is a factual question to
            which a true answer can be found. And if true, the related question
            of whether and how much compensation the plaintiffs should receive
            from the defendant corporations is a question of justice as well
            as law. And finally, acknowledging an emotional dimension to
            the assignment of proper legal responsibility to the defendants
            for their actions is a not a sign of intellectual immaturity;
            instead it is evidence of a richer humanity.  <br>
                <br>
            A third element of the professional model  is its definition
            of  &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; lawyering solely in
            terms of craft skills. Since law is a series of preset procedures
            in which plaintiff and defendant wage a form of warfare, and
            since there is no right answer to the issues they contest, a
            good lawyer is not a hero who obtains justice, but rather an
            expert who works the procedures to yield a result favorable to
            his client. The professional model pictures lawyers operating
            in a morally flattened universe in which craft values dominate.
            Once again using <i>A Civil Action</i> as an example, the professional
            model would argue that Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall) who keeps
            relevant evidence hurtful to his client away from the jury is
            the &quot;good&quot; lawyer.  Perhaps we need to broaden our
            definition of &quot;good.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I don't want to be seen as
            merely trashing the professional model; it has its virtues. 
            Law students need to learn how to think through problems methodically,
            not just rushing to embrace emotionally appealing  conclusions.
              But  I do think it gives an unduly amoral view of the lawyer's
            role, one which unnecessarily subverts  the idealism that brings
            many students to choose law as a career in the first place.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The study of  lawyer films,
            even unrealistic lawyer films,  therefore can provide an important
            supplement to the curriculum by teaching some important lessons.
             The most important lesson is that justice counts. The very quantity
            of 'law' films demonstrates that the human appetite for justice
            is just as strong as our appetites for power and sex.  <br>
             <br>
            Good lawyer films,  like <i>To King A Mockingbird</i> and <i>A
            Civil Action</i>, also teach a second important lesson: the practice
            of law is fraught with ethical consequence. We can still debate
            today whether Atticus Finch failed his client in submitting his
            fate to a racist state court jury instead of seeking the aid
            of  the federal court.  So too the ethical dilemmas facing Jan
            Schlichtmann, the lawyer who represents the families harmed 
            by toxic water, are worthy of our deepest consideration. Schlichtmann
            comes in with a simple goal-- to get as large fee as possible
            with as little risk as possible. Yet slowly he discovers he wants
            more; he wants to see justice done even though it's not exactly
            clear what that concept means in this context.  He finds himself
            in a quandary. If he &quot;takes the money and runs&quot; as
            he originally planned, he is no more than the &quot;ambulance
            chaser&quot; the defense lawyers think him. But if he proceeds
            with the case, he puts his clients, his partners, and himself
            at financial risk. It's not easy for Schlichtmann or the viewer
            to to balance these conflicting considerations, especially since
            they don't calibrate on the same measure, but I think discussion
            of a movie like <i>A Civil Action</i> can teach students that
            the some of the most challenging parts of being a lawyer start
            just where the professional model leaves off. <hr align="LEFT"></font><a name="quote"></a><font size="-2" face="Verdana">1.</font><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> </font><font size="-2" face="Verdana">Quoted
