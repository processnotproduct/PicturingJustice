            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Movies not only entertain,
            they instruct. Films help shape our interpretations of the significance
            of new events and suggest appropriate responses. In other words,
            films help create the &quot;slots&quot; into which we place new
            events, each slot calling for a different response. For instance,
            members of the Bush administration were shocked by the Al Qaeda
            attacks on the World Trade Center and quickly had to determine
            the attacks' significance and plan an appropriate response. Should
            the United States interpret the attack as an outrageous crime
            whose perpetrators must be found and prosecuted to the limits
            of the law or as an act of war that merited a military rather
            than a legal response? Was the attack more like the terrorist
            bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City or the Japanese
            attack on Pearl Harbor? <br>
<br>
            President Clinton had interpreted the earlier attack on the World
            Trade Center as a horrendous crime, not an act of war. There
            are indications that Secretary of State Colin Powell was at first
            also thinking of the attacks in terms of the &quot;crime &quot;
            slot. Powell was in Peru attending a conference of foreign ministers
            when he heard of the attacks and he told the assembled diplomats
            &quot;you can be sure that America will deal with this tragedy
            in a way that brings those responsible to justice.&quot; But
            President Bush immediately interpreted the attack as an act of
            war. He later told reporter Bob Woodward that his first reaction
            was &quot;They had declared war on us, and I made up my mind
            at that moment that we were going to war.&quot; I believe that
            that mythic images drawn from films might have influenced this
            crucial &quot;slotting&quot; decision. <br>
<br>
            Just as there are &quot;law&quot; movies like <i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i>
            that implicitly argue that the disciplined logic of law provides
            the best template for dealing with social conflict, there are
            other &quot;lawless&quot; films that argue that law incapable
            of handling certain conflicts and, therefore, violence is society's
            necessary recourse. These &quot;lawless&quot; films present a
            negative view of law, identifying it with weakness, femininity,
            corruption, and impersonality. The weakness of law requires reliance
            on the efficacy of &quot;honorable&quot; violence. And since
            life copies art just as art copies life, perhaps we should not
            be surprised if this same preference for lawless, honorable violence
            influenced political decisions like the American response to
            9/11.<br>
<br>
            <img src="images/dirtyharry.jpg" width="133" height="200" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Consider the image of law portrayed
            by Don Siegel's <i>Dirty Harry</i>. <i>Dirty Harry</i> shows
            us a society in law is so weak that that violence has infiltrated
            the rule of law itself, blurring the distinction between legal
            and lawless violence. <i>Dirty Harry</i> tells the story of how
            a maverick police detective Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) saves
            San Francisco from the violence of a vicious sociopath named
            Scorpio who has murdered several local women. From the outset
            Harry makes it clear that he is engaged in a &quot;dirty war&quot;
            with incarnate evil that justifies any effective method. Cruising
            through the red light district, he comments to his partner, &quot;I'd
            like to put a net over the whole bunch of them.&quot; He finally
            captures Scorpio with a gunshot and elicits a confession from
            him by means of torture. Harry feels proud of a job well done,
            but that is not a view shared by the film's representative of
            the rule of law, District Attorney William T. Rothko (Joseph
            Summer). Rothko illustrates the inability of the law to deal
            effectively with the type of incarnate evil the homicidal sociopath
            represents. Rothko is a captive of the rule of law, so constricted
            by procedural requirements that he has no time or energy to protect
            honest citizens. <br>
<br>
            Callahan is called to the District Attorney's office after the
            killer's arrest expecting an expression of gratitude. Instead
            Rothko informs him that the suspect will be set free because
            Callahan has not followed all the technical rules the U.S. Supreme
            Court has laid down for the arrest of alleged wrongdoers. Rothko
            pompously reminds Callahan that &quot;the defendant has rights,&quot;
            but the audience instinctively feels he is not talking about
            rights, but rules that must be slavishly followed irrespective
            of context. Callahan replies that he is more interested in the
            rights of the women the defendant has already killed and the
            others he will kill when released. Rothko is unmoved; Callahan
            has not obeyed the law, a comment to which Harry replies &quot;Then
            the law is crazy&quot;. The audience is likely to agree. Law
            as represented by Rothko is both cold and ineffective, the product
            of a tired bureaucracy that has given up on its mission to protect
            honest citizens. <br>
<br>
            Harry Callahan in contrast is both hot-blooded and, as Scorpio
            discovers at the end of the film, deadly effective in his pursuit
            of justice. Played by <i>The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly</i>
            star Clint Eastwood, Callahan is an icon of machismo feared but
            respected by colleagues and criminals alike. Unlike lawyer Rothko,
            Harry takes evil personally. It's a fight to the death. He knows
            that criminal suspects are scum and he hopes that they will &quot;make
            his day&quot; by provoking his deadly wrath. Once you know that
            your adversary is not only guilty, but evil, then the procedural
            obstacles the law sets up to conviction do seem &quot;crazy.&quot;
            The serial killer Scorpio must be more than prosecuted; he must
            be exterminated. There is no room for doubt in Harry Callahan's
            mind. He knows that when law is too rule-bound to obtain justice,
            it is only natural that society call on the legal vigilante to
            get the job done. What Harry does not realize is that a legal
            vigilante is more dangerous than a sociopath criminal because
            there is no legal check on his violence. A &quot;lawless&quot;
            state has much greater capacity for violence than a hundred Scorpios.
<br>
<br>
            To approach the question of popular films might influence public
            policy decisions like Bush's response to 9/11/ I think we first
            have to determine exactly how images in popular culture interact
            with society. Simply stated, images drawn from popular culture
            both inform our perceptions of new events and shape our list
            of possible responses to them. This is what I call the &quot;slotting&quot;
            function of popular culture. <br>
<br>
            Richard Slotkin in his classic <i>Gunfighter Nation</i> studies
            how popular films both reflect and motivate social action. He
            also sets out a particular myth drawn from popular culture that,
            as we shall see, neatly tracks much of what we know of how the
            Bush &quot;war&quot; decision was actually made. Slotkin calls
            it the &quot;savage war&quot; metaphor. Throughout the 20th century,
            American popular culture has often relied upon the metaphor of
            a &quot;savage war&quot; to mediate the tensions between America's
            democratic ideology and its imperial destiny.<br>
<br>
            The &quot; savage war&quot; myth can be unpacked to show several
            related components. First, it always involves a battle to the
            death between two races, one primitive and one civilized. Usually
            it is a battle between the &quot;civilized&quot; white settlers
            and the &quot;primitive&quot; red Indians. Secondly, The battle
            is provoked by an atrocity committed by the primitive race; the
            primitives commit a massacre or make captives of civilized innocents,
            usually women or children. This savage act demonstrates that
            the group is beyond the moral pale, evil incarnate, and therefore
            no attempt at compromise is acceptable. Once begun, the battle
            is to the death so no quarter can be given. <br>
<br>
            The primitive race initially has the advantage over its civilized
            foe for two related reasons. First, it retains a ruthless capacity
            for violence that has been drained from its civilized foe and
            also is not hampered in its tactics by civilized codes of behavior,
            like law, that impede effective action. The tide of battle turns
            when the civilized race turns to &quot;the man who knows Indians&quot;;
            this hero bridges the cultural gap by combining the civilized
            virtues of his race with the primitive capacity for lawless violence
            of his foes. The denouement is a victory for the civilized race
            that has been spiritually and morally regenerated by its symbolic
            infusion of primitive energy.<br>
<br>
            It is easy to see ( as Slotkin does) <i>Dirty Harry</i> as 1970's
            urban variant on the &quot;savage war&quot; theme. There is a
            war between the &quot;good&quot; people of San Francisco and
            their &quot;degenerate&quot; foes. The battle begins with Scorpio's
            sadistic kidnapping and killing of young women. District Attorney
            Rothko represents how the civilized society is unfairly disadvantaged
            in this war, both because of irrational legal codes of behavior
            (U.S. Supreme Court decisions) and a morally flabby mindset that
            refuses to engage the enemy on his own terms. Harry Callahan
            is clearly &quot;the man who knows Indians&quot;. He not only
            acts to further the civilized goal of protecting the innocent,
            but has no qualms about using whatever tactics, no matter how
            violent or illegal, necessary to achieve success.<br>
<br>
            When we read Bob Woodward's insider account of how President
            Bush and his colleagues reacted to the 9/11 attacks, it is impossible
            to ignore the parallels between actual events and the &quot;savage
            war&quot; narrative. First, we have the &quot;atrocity;&quot;
            the massacre of three thousand innocents in the World Trade Center.
            The lines are drawn between the opposing groups in stark terms,
            not of race, but of ethnicity and religion. In an early meeting
            with Congressional leaders, President Bush said of the Muslim
            Arab terrorists that &quot;they hate Christianity. They hate
            Judaism. They hate everything that is not them.&quot; Secretary
            State Powell soon joined in: &quot;This is not just an attack
            against America; this is an attack against civilization&#133;.&quot;
            Bush went even further in a talk at the National Cathedral Washington,
            D.C.: &quot; But our responsibility to history is already clear:
            To answer these attacks and rid the world of evil.&quot; The
            attackers were clearly beyond the moral pale, like Scorpio candidates
            for extermination, not prosecution.<br>
<br>
            Woodward also reports that Bush felt Cllinton has shown himself
            morally flabby when confronted with terrorist attacks. Consider
            these comments by Bush about Clinton's decision to only launch
            a cruise missile in response to the embassy bombings in 1998:<br>
            &quot;The antiseptic notion of launching a cruise missile into
            some guy's , you know, tent, really is a joke. &quot; <br>
            &quot; I mean, people viewed that as the impotent American&#133;.
            a flaccid, you know, kind of technologically competent but not
            very tough country that was willing to launch a cruise missile
            out of submarine and that'd be it.&quot; <br>
            &quot; I do believe there is the image of America out there that
            we are so materialistic, that we're almost hedonistic, that we
            don't have values, and that when struck, we wouldn't fight back.&quot;<br>
<br>
            Besides the moral flabbiness, the Bush people were also upset
            about the bureaucratic legal restraints on effective action.
            CIA director George Tenet complained that in the pre 9/11 era
            his agency had been &quot;lawyered to death.&quot; Tenet felt
            that after 9/11 &quot; there can be no bureaucratic impediments
            to success. All the rules have changed.&quot; President Bush
            agreed: &quot; I had to show the American people the resolve
            of a commander in chief that was going to do whatever it took
            to win. No yielding, No equivocation, No, you know, lawyering
            this thing to death, that we're after them.&quot; <br>
<br>
            In the &quot;savage war&quot; myth, this is where the &quot;
            the man who knows Indians&quot; appears, the bold hero who can
            give the primitives a dose of their own medicine. And CIA Director
            Tenet seemed ready to play the part. Here is how Woodward summarizes
            the CIA proposal:<br>
            &quot;At the heart of he proposal was a recommendation that the
            president give what Tenet labeled 'exceptional authorities' to
            the CIA to destroy al Qaeda in Afghanistan and the rest of the
            world. He wanted a broad intelligence order permitting the CIA
            to conduct covert operations without having to come back for
            formal approval for each specific operation. The current process
            involved too much time, lawyering, reviews, and debate. The CIA
            needed new robust authority to operate without restraint. Tenet
            also wanted encouragement from the president to take risks.&quot;
<br>
<br>
            Specifically he wanted CIA authority to use the full range of
            covert instruments, including deadly force. He also wanted to
            financially support key foreign intelligence services to expand
            the CIA&quot;s reach. Tenet warned Bush that some of these groups
            had dreadful human rights records with reputations for using
            torture to obtain confessions. Woodward reports: &quot;Bush said
            he understood the risks.&quot; Perhaps CIA operative Cofer Black
            best summarized the new virile attitude: &quot;We're gong to
            kill them. We're going to put their heads on sticks.&quot; <br>
<br>
            The &quot;savage war&quot; metaphor could have affected policy
            in either or both of two ways. It could have been a motivating
            factor or a technique of justification. Bush's ingestion of images
            from popular culture might have shaped his perception of the
            terrorist attacks and suggested appropriate responses to them
            or he might just have used the vocabulary of the &quot;savage
            war&quot; to explain his decision in terms that would resonate
            favorably with the American people. I'm not sure which thesis
            is more frightening.<br>
<br>
            But let me end with a caveat. The fact the images from popular
            culture might have influenced our response to 9/11 does not demonstrate
            that those decisions were wrong. It might be that &quot;savage
            war&quot; metaphor encapsules important truths that we ignore
            at our peril. Then again the &quot;savage war&quot; myth might
            be no more than a story we tell ourselves to project our own
            aggressive instincts onto a dehumanized &quot;other&quot; in
            perpetuation of an endless cycle of reciprocal violence. <br>
<br>
            If this latter proposition is true, maybe it's time to move beyond
            the &quot;Man Who Knows Indians&quot; to alternative heroic narratives.
            One might be a more muscular view of law like that shown on <i>Law
            And Order</i>, one where public safety and due process are not
            seen as incompatible. Another might forego victim myths to see
            us as part of a large world that we have helped and with other
            will continue to create. <br>
