                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At first glance I thought this
                  film would be <i>The Exorcist III</i>, but I was surprised to
                  learn it was primarily a courtroom drama, and a pretty good one.
                   The film cuts back and forth from a trial to flashbacks that
                  tell the story of Emily Rose and a priest named Father Moore.
                   This is based on a true story.<br>
<br>
                  <i><img src="images/exorcism.jpg" width="138" height="92" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"></i>Emily Rose is a college student
                  from a religious family who begins to have nightmares, sees demons
                  everywhere, speaks in foreign languages and has her body contort
                  involuntarily.  The Doctors say she has epilepsy with psychotic
                  episodes, and that this can be controlled by medication.  She
                  is given the medication and takes it. When she gets worse, her
                  family calls in Father Moore, their parish priest.  He tells
                  Emily to stop the medication and gets permission from the archdiocese
                  to do an exorcism.  During this procedure, Emily Rose dies and
                  Father Moore is charged with negligent homicide.<br>
<br>
                  The court and jury are asked to decide either that Emily Rose
                  was actually possessed by the devil and Father Moore did his
                  best to save her, or that she had epilepsy and his actions, especially
                  discontinuing the medication, caused her death.  There was medical
                  testimony to support this latter view.  The decision would seem
                  to be based on the individual juror's personal views on this
                  issue.  There is no doubt that Father Moore believes in her possession
                  and did what he thought was best for Emily Rose.  Is this enough
                  for a not guilty verdict, even if you think Father Moore is wrong?
                   Father Moore's own lawyer is an agnostic and doesn't believe
                  in the devil, but Moore tells her, &quot;Demons exist whether
                  you believe in them or not.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  Not only is the defense lawyer, well played by Laura Linney,
                  an agnostic, but the prosecutor is deeply religious.  He presents
                  his case skillfully and forcefully.  Father Moore is portrayed
                  as a rational and reasonable man who believes in what he did.<br>
                    <br>
                  The film is taut and well made, intentionally dark in the non-courtroom
                  scenes.  All three main characters, the defense counsel, the
                  priest and the prosecutor are well acted.  The court room scenes
                  are well done.  For me, there was too much of Emily Rose going
                  through her manifestations of possession so that they could scare
                  us.  The viewers are left to make up their own minds as to guilt
                  or innocence and as to what actually happened.  Each side presents
                  evidence to support their version. The jury does render a verdict.
                   The film seems to me to lean a little in favor of true possession
                  for entertainment purposes.  Presumably the filmmaker thinks
                  that a film where possession is just debunked would be less interesting.
<br>
<br>
                  There are also some side plots.  The defense counsel works for
                  the law firm that represents the archdiocese.  To avoid the embarrassment
                  of a trial, the archdiocese wants Father Moore to accept an offered
                  plea bargain.  The firm tells the defense lawyer either to take
                  the bargain or if not, in no instance is Father Moore to be allowed
                  to take the stand.  If she does not follow instructions, she
                  will be fired.   Or course Father Moore refuses the plea and
                  insists on telling the full story in court.  The defense attorney
                  must resolve this dilemma.  She does admire Father Moore even
                  if she thinks he is misguided. <br>
                   <br>
                  The film is being marketed as a horror movie, and parts of it
                  fit that description.  But it is more than that.  It is a good
                  courtroom drama with legal and ethical issues to be resolved
                  by us as well as the court.   <br>
