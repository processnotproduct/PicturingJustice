                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Judge J. Howard Sundermann</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">What am I doing reviewing a
                  musical?  I asked myself similar questions while sitting in the
                  theatre waiting for <i>Chicag</i>o to start, but my wife said
                  that I owed her one since the last few movies we had seen took
                  place in either a space ship or a submarine.  But, to my surprise
                  I liked <i>Chicago</i>.  <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/chicago.jpg" width="184" height="123" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The musicals I like can be counted
                  on one hand with several fingers left over.  My criteria for
                  a good musical are that not only must the musical numbers be
                  good but the music must also help tell the story or develop a
                  character.  Some examples are <i>Cabaret, Man of LaMancha, </i>or<i>
                  The Sound of Music</i>.  <i>Chicago</i> is not as good as these,
                  but it works.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Chicago</i> is set in the 1920's and is based on a Bob Fosse
                  stage play that first opened in 1975 and was then revived in
                  1996.  Roxie Hart, a would be singing and dancing star, kills
                  a man she is having an affair with when she finds out that he
                  does not have the show business connections he lead her to believe
                  he had.  In prison, Roxie meets Velma Kelly, a successful performer
                  who killed her sister, her dancing partner.  Roxie and Velma
                  hire slick lawyer Billy Flynn, who has never lost a case.  Flynn's
                  strategy is to make his clients darlings of the media (truth
                  is not an obstacle) and turn the town and the jury in their favor.
                   Flynn refers to the court as a three-ring circus and says he
                  can win any case with the &quot;old razzle dazzle.&quot;  Flynn
                  has one criterion for a new client; they must be able to come
                  up with $5,000.00.  He says, &quot;If Jesus Christ had lived
                  in Chicago, and if he'd had $5,000.00 and had come to me, things
                  would have turned out differently.&quot; <br>
                   <br>
                  The use of traditional Hollywood stars, rather than singers and
                  dancers, was controversial in the media but I think it turned
                  out well.  Renee Zellweger plays Roxie Hart, and captures her
                  vulnerability as well as her growing confidence as she becomes
                  a media star.  The camera cuts are able to hide some lack of
                  dancing ability for her as well as the others.  Who thought Catherine
                  Zeta-Jones, as Velma Kelly, could sing and dance, and who cares
                  when she is on the screen. But she can do both well, and her
                  numbers have high energy and style. <br>
                   <br>
                  The biggest surprise is Richard Gere as Billy Flynn.  He has
                  played a slick lawyer before, but he is also believable as a
                  song and dance man. Flynn is no Atticus Finch; there is a scene
                  where he and Roxie totally create a history for her and a story
                  to tell the jury.  In court, neither truth or courtroom decorum
                  are considerations in the presentation of her defense.  In one
                  courtroom scene, the camera goes back and forth between testimony
                  and the musical number &quot;Razzle Dazzle.&quot;  You get the
                  picture.  As is all too common in modern film, the attorney is
                  presented as totally corrupt and only interested in winning at
                  any price, not just for money but also for his own fame.  But,
                  Flynn is so over the top that he is clearly such a caricature
                  that no one should walk out of the film taking him seriously.
                   <br>
<br>
                  Roxie is no Mary Poppins.  She accepts Flynn's suggestions, not
                  only to get out of a murder charge, but because she thinks it
                  will help make her a star.  She invents a pregnancy during the
                  trial when it looks like things could use a lift.<br>
<br>
                  Queen Latifah is terrific as the prison matron, and her version
                  of &quot;When Your Good to Mama&quot; would be a showstopper
                  to a live audience.  John C. Reilly, a good character actor,
                  is perfect as Roxie's not too bright husband.  If you like musicals
                  you will love this film, and if you don't, it's still OK.<br>
