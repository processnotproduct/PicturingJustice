    dramas have enjoyed popularity on the screen and on television (<i>Ally McBeal, The
    Practice, Street Legal, etc</i>.) as well as in popular fiction. Ever since the days of
    William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens, stories and dramas portraying legal themes and

    The Just; or Shakespeare's brilliant Portia, who defends Antonio, and her unforgettable

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <font size="1"><p><font face="Verdana">Crime fiction has always been concerned with right
            and wrong; when the detective apprehends the murderer, there is a sense that the world has
            been reclaimed from chaos, that order has been established. Legal-fiction takes this idea
            even further, as the characters struggle to understand not simply right and wrong but <i>justice</i>B
            a far more elusive and difficult concept. The desire for justice in a world that seems
            unjust in the extreme is shared not only by lawyers but also by the common man, and this
            may be the major reason why legal-fiction has taken a lead ahead of contemporary crime
            fiction. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Verdana">Glancing through the bestseller charts, we note the regular
    presence of many genre practitioners and an overwhelming percentage of novels belonging to
    the legal-fiction category occupying, in some weeks, up to half the charts. Every
    succeeding year sees major new talents breaking into print, a further indication, if any
    is needed, of the genre's robust health and unflagging energy. Despite a veritable
    plethora of new titles, the general standards of quality always appear to be on the
    increase. Why are so many lawyers dabbling in fiction? The question is a timely one in
    light of the current rash of legal suspense novels. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In the words of John Grisham:</font></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <font size="1"><p><font face="Verdana">There are several reasons. First, every lawyer has
            a good story. We lawyers get involved with people who have messed up their lives, and
            their mistakes make fascinating stories. Street lawyers see the underbelly of society.
            Corporate lawyers see high-stakes shenanigans. And since law school and bar exams require
            some measure of talent with the written word, lawyers think they can add a twist here and
            a subplot there and produce a real thriller. Second, most lawyers would rather be doing
            something else. The profession is overcrowded and the competition is fierce. Most of the
            work is terribly boring. There is tremendous dissatisfaction within the profession, and
            almost every lawyer I know is looking for a way out. Third, lawyers dream of big, quick
            money. A gruesome car wreck, an oil spill, a fat fee for a leveraged buyout, a large
            retainer from a white-collar defendant. It just goes with the turf. A nice advance against
            royalties, some foreign rights, maybe a movie deal, and suddenly there is cash galore. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Verdana">Again the startling publishing success of the lawyer-procedural
    since the late 1980's also can be related to massive changes in the historical conditions,
    which underpin the production and consumption of suspense fiction. The collapse of the
    Soviet Union, the disintegration of the eastern block and the end of the cold war made the
    old-style NATO spy thrillers obsolete. Legal fiction stepped into this vacant niche in the
    market, placing the thrills now in a domestic rather than an international setting and
    capturing what commentators identified as &quot;a new national mood of introspection
    brought on by the loss of the ideological certainties associated with the old twin-
    superpower world system.&quot; Each of these authors referred to in this compilation have
    contributed to the field of legal fiction, explored the world of law and lawyers, bringing
    their own viewpoint and unique insight to what seems an almost boundless arena. What
    should strike the legal-fiction lover is the enormous variety of theme, style and content
    these authors have shown in their works. Lawyer books might seem to all have the same
    cover art, but between the covers there is a world of difference, from the flamboyance of
    Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason to the shrewdness of John Masterman's Ernst Brendel and
    from the dark world of Michael Nava's Henry Rios to the brighter world of John Mortimer's
    Horace Rumpole.</font></font><font size="3"><b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">THE PIONEERS</font></b></font><font size="1"><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Goethe in Germany; Flaubert, Maupassant, Moliere, Jules Verne,
    Balzac, Dumas, Gaston Leroux, Maurice Le Blanc and Proust in France; Chaucer, R. L.
    Stevenson, John Evelyn, Henry Fielding, William Cowper, De Quincey, Thackeray, Sir Thomas
    More, John Galsworthy, Charles Dickens (whose <i>Bleak House</i> is a recognized classic
    within and outside the legal- fiction genre) and Walter Scott in England; James Fennimore
    Cooper, Wallace Stevens and Henry James in United States; Leo Tolstoy in Russia; Bankim
    Chandra Chartterjee and Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai in India: although all studied to
    become lawyers, none of their works dealt in depth about the law, lawyers or justice.</font><b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Wilkie Collins</font></b>, a Barrister in England in the late 19<sup>th</sup>
    century, was the first to use the combination of law and fiction to spectacular heights.
    However, few would consider him a popular cultural icon today. The works of Collins dealt
    in depth with various legal issues. Unlike Post or Gardner, there was no 'The Protagonist'
    in Collins work. The protagonist was the theme, rather than the character. <i>No Name</i>
    (1862) dealt with the rights of illegitimate children, <i>Armadale </i>(1866) on
    prostitution and abortion and <i>Evil Genius</i> (1886) on divorce and child custody. <i>Women
    in White</i> and <i>The Moonstone</i> were good mysteries. However, Collins' works were
    never considered as belonging to the legal-fiction genre during that period. </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Again <b>Anna Katherine Green </b>explored the ways of the law,
    lawyers and justice in<b> </b><i>The Leavenworth Case: A Lawyer's Story</i> (1872).<i> <b>Melville
    Davisson</b></i> <i>Post's</i> The Strange Schemes of Randolph Mason (1896) is the first
    acknowledged legal-fiction work, a grand collection of short stories. Post was a lawyer, a
    politician, a judicial reformist and above all an author <i>par excellence</i>. Randolph
    Mason, the protagonist of most Post short stories, was a skilled, unscrupulous lawyer who
    used his knowledge of law to defeat the ends of justice. Mason assisted criminals by
    cynically employing his familiarity with legal loopholes. However, in <i>The Corrector of
    Destinies</i> we find a reformed Mason who acts more in the interest of the written law. <i>The
    Man of Last Resort</i> is another good Mason work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">However, the genre started to truly develop only in the second
    decade of the twentieth century. <b>Francis Noyes Hart</b> in <i>The Bellamy Trial </i>(1926)
    gave us the first novel-length courtroom drama, which was based on the famous Hall-Mills
    case. The locale is a courtroom throughout, and the novel derives much of its immediacy
    and conviction from being told through the consciousness of a young woman on a first
    reporting assignment and a more cynical, experienced reporter who falls in love during the
    eight days of the trial. During the trial sensations occur--a key witness commits suicide,
    a dilatory witness, in compromising circumstances, appears at the last moment; the
    solution is finally revealed only in a letter the judge receives in his chamber,
    culminating in what is the best feature of crime novels, the format of a court procedure.
    Theodore Dreiser in <i>An American Tragedy</i> (1923) gave us a detailed and harrowing
    account of trial action involved in the murder trial of Clyde Griffiths, accused of a
    rowboat drowning of his wife to marry a rich social heiress, known in trial as Miss X. The
    book is loosely based on the 1906 trial and conviction of Chester Gillette for the murder
    of Grace Brown. Raymond Postgate gives an in-depth study into the factors influencing jury
    deliberations in <i>The Verdict of Twelve.</i> Postgate gives a detailed biography of six
    of the twelve jurors, who must decide whether a middle-aged lady has committed the murder
    of her nephew. Each juror brings a set of personal attitudes and problems,which prevents
    them from considering evidence objectively, and responds emotionally rather than
    realistically. The jury deliberations form the core of the novel with an unconventional
    twist in the tail ending. <b>John Buchan,</b> a doyen among mystery writers of the time,
    also tried his hand at legal fiction. After becoming a Barrister in 1900, he later became
    a prolific crime writer, writing among many other works, the excellent <i>The Thirty-Nine
    Steps</i>. In <i>The Power- House;</i> Buchan introduced Sir Edward Leithen, a man of
    contemplation rather than that of action. Good Leithen works include <i>John Macnab, The
    Dancing Floor and Sick Heart River.</i> Prolific crime writer <b>G.K Chesterton</b> also
    gave us some memorable stories in legal fiction, but they never rose above the mystery
    genre. More famed as the creator of <i>Father Brown</i>, Chesterton also penned the
    stories of Basil Grant, a retired judge, who solves mysteries in tandem with his brother
    Rupert, but these have fallen into oblivion. Good stories include &quot; The Tremendous
    Adventure of Major Brown&quot; and &quot;The Singular Speculation of the House Agent&quot;
    and others, which have been collected in a wonderful collection, <i>Club of Queer Trades</i>.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">It was only in the late thirties and the early forties that legal
    fiction developed as a special category in the genre of crime fiction. </font><b><font size="3"><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">THE THIRTIES TO FIFTIES</font></font><font size="1"><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Erle Stanley Gardner</font></font></b>, the creator of Perry Mason, the
    lawyer-detective, can no doubt be called the <i><b>architect of legal fiction</b></i> and
    the acknowledged master in this genre. Gardner was a lawyer who achieved moderate success
    in his profession. However, with the success of his novels and short stories Gardner
    became one of the wealthiest mystery writers of his time. The 82 Mason adventures, from <i>The
    Case of the Velvet Claws</i> (1933) to the posthumously published <i>The Case of the
    Postponed Murder</i> (1973), were characterized by breakneck pacing, convoluted plots,
    firework displays of courtroom tactics (which Gardner once boasted that he used in his own
    law practise) and gripping readability. Della Street, the private secretary, and Paul
    Drake, the detective, were other regulars in Perry Mason Novels. Perry Mason also became a
    television series starring Raymond Burr. The very fact that Perry Mason outshined his
    creator is the testament to the success of Erle Stanley Gardner. A brief and short attempt
    was made by <b>Thomas Chastain</b> in the nineties to resurrect Perry Mason. Good works
    included <i>The Case of the Burning Bequest</i> and <i>Case of Too Many Murders</i>.
    However, the series ended after the death of Chastain in 1994. Gardner's claim as the
    architect of legal fiction does not rest on the fame of Perry Mason alone. Way before he
    created Mason, Gardner had created the young, fresh law graduate Ken Corning, who appeared
    in <i>Honest Money, The Top Comes Off, Devil's Fire, Close Call etc</i>. published from a
    period between 1931 and 1933. In the late forties Gardner also gave us the D.A. series of
    books featuring D.A. Doug Selby, including <i>The D.A. Draws a Circle</i> and <i>D.A.
    Takes a Chance</i>. Gardner also created Peter Wennick, lawyer and sleuth featured in <i>Among
    Thieves, Leg Man </i>and in<i> Take it or Leave it. </i>Gardner's last series (as <b>A.A.
    Fair</b>) featured lawyer and farmer Donald Lam, seen in <i>Bigger They Come, Beware the
    Curves etc</i>. However, the success of Gardner in Perry Mason novels completely
    outshadowed his other features, and today his fame rests as the creator of the legendary
    Perry Mason. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Arthur Train</font></b>, an Assistant Attorney of New York County, saw
    stories in the procession of human comedies and tragedies that passed through the criminal
    court building. His first collection of short stories, <i>McAllister and his Double</i>,
    contained four stories of a young attorney John Dockbridge. However, Train is best
    remembered for his most famous character, Ephraim Tutt, a Lincolnesque lawyer with his
    frock coat, stovepipe hat and fondness for stogies. The early Tutt stories all followed a
    formula, the statement of the problem, the seeming impossibility of the triumph of justice
    over the technicalities of law and Mr. Tutt's solution to the problem. Tutt is a figure
    from American folklore, the shrewd Yankee on the side of the underdog. Great Tutt works
    include <i>The Hermit of Turkey Hollow</i>, <i>Adventures of Ephraim Tutt, Tut Tut Mr.
    Tutt </i>and<i> Tutt for Tutt.</i><b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Henry Cecil</font></b> was a contemporary of Gardner. However, Cecil was
    more interested in legal issues and loopholes in the law than in courtroom dramas or in
    flamboyant lawyers. Cecil had a good eye for detail, and though he was very knowledgeable
    about law and the legal system he was never pedantic. His two main characters, Ambrose Low<i><b>
    </b></i>and<i><b> </b></i>Colonel Brian, are shown as con men who never commit anything
    illegal but twist the loopholes in the law to their advantage. <i>Tell You What I'll Do</i>,<i>
    No Bail for the Judge</i> and<i> According to Evidence </i>(where Low gets a man acquitted
    of murdering a murderer) are fascinating examples of Cecil's creativity. <i>Brief to
    Counsel</i> and <i>Not Such an Ass</i> provide light reading into the day-to-day working
    of the English legal system. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Harold Q. Masur </font></b>is<b> </b>yet another famous lawyer-writer and
    the creator of the flamboyant lawyer detective Scott Jordan. Though Jordan can be compared
    to Perry Mason in the sense that both are lawyer detectives, Jordan tales generally eschew
    the elaborate courtroom dramas that are the hallmark of Mason stories. Masur draws on his
    legal background to provide plot springboards, which turn on some interesting aspect of
    law that Jordan encounters during practice. Narrated in the first person, Jordan books are
    tightly plotted, well clued and frequently surprising in denouement. <i>The Big Money, The
    Legacy Lenders</i> and the short story collection <i>The Name is Jordan</i> are the best
    among the Jordan works. Though not featuring Jordan, <i>The Attorney</i> is a classic tale
    of a sensational sex-murder case which focus on the complexities of the criminal trial
    system and legal ethics and is a must-read for the legal-fiction lover.<b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Edgar Lustgarten, </font></b>a British criminologist and lawyer, started
    his writing career in the early 1930's. Lustgarten realistically portrays lawyers, judges
    and witnesses while maintaining suspense till the end. <i>A Case to Answer</i> is a
    masterfully written narrative of a trial of a young man for the murder of a prostitute. <i>Game
    for Three Losers</i> deals with an elaborate plot of blackmail involving a highly regarded
    Member of Parliament. It portrays a legal system where innocents are not protected and
    even worse, may be tried along with the guilty. <i>Prisoner at the Bar</i>, The<i> Judges
    and the Judged</i> are other good works of this author reflecting not only an incisive wit
    but also a probing criticism of the law.<b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Craig Rice </font></b>(pseudonym for Georgina Randolph) the first dame in
    legal- fiction is best remembered for the Chicago lawyer John J. Malone whom we first
    encounter in <i>8 Faces at Three </i>where the victim is found in a room where all the
    clocks have stopped at three. Malone is no Perry Mason or Mr. Tutt, except in his success
    in the courtroom, a setting we are never shown. Short and pudgy, with a red face and hair
    always in need of combing, Malone wears a suit with a perpetual slept-in look, his
    shirtfront and vest covered with cigar ash. However Malone's compelling interest in life
    is justice. He will reveal the guilty party in the story and then proceed to defend him in
    the coming trial. Other regulars in Malone novels include Jake and Helene Justuses and Von
    Flanagan, a homicide detective. The basic format of Rice novels involves a statement of
    the problem in an imaginative opening scene told from the viewpoint of the victim or chief
    suspect and then shifts to introduce Malone. The success of Malone even prompted Rice to
    adopt another pseudonym Ruth Malone. <i>Trial By Fury and The Right Murder </i>ranks best
    among the Malone novels.<b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Henry Wade </font></b>was a Justice of Peace and a County Alderman for
    Buckingham shire in England. His experience as an Alderman is revealed in the exciting,
    suspense thriller, <i>Dying Alderman</i>. In <i>Missing Partners</i>, Wade takes us to the
    effects of miscarriage of justice on the victims of such miscarriage. <i>Too Soon To Die</i>
    is an interesting thriller where the protagonist resorts to homicide and fake suicides to
    escape from the exorbitant tax laws of England. On the whole Wade provides an enjoyable
    evening read. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Cyril Hare</font></b> (pseudonym for Alfred Alexander Clark) became a
    county court Judge in 1950. But his series detective, Francis Pettigrew, is an aging and
    unsuccessful lawyer who is barely making a living. He originally showed much promise and
    aptitude for law, but a series of misfortunes have left him a bitter man. Hare's early
    novels did not feature Pettigrew or Hare's legal expertise. <i>Tragedy at Law</i> is the
    classic Hare work, which gave him recognition as a legal author. It is a lovingly detailed
    story of a judge who falls onto the wrong side of the law when, while he is far from
    sober, his car hits a pedestrian. Very near the end of the novel, a murder problem arises
    and Pettigrew matches wits with the State and wins the case. Henry Cecil has acknowledged
    this work as &quot;a work of the highest class in detective fiction with a legal
    background.&quot; Hare followed <i>Tragedy at Law </i>with<i> With a Bare Bodkin, When the
    Wind Blows </i>and<i> That Yew Tree's Shadow.</i> Other regulars in Hare novels include
    Inspector Mallett, who started as Hare's principal character in his earlier works but was
    relegated to the status of a sidekick with the success of Pettigrew works. Pettigrew and
    Hare both have gained an almost legendary status in the contemporary legal-fiction genre. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">John Masterman</font></b>, though a non-lawyer and a history teacher by
    profession, is the creator of the famous Viennese law teacher and detective of
    international repute Ernst Brendel. Brendel first stars in <i>An Oxford Tragedy</i>
    considered a classic at the time of its publication in 1951. Brendel, who arrives in a
    college to give a series of lectures, engages in a lively discussion of the nature of
    crime and detection. Soon after the evening's discussion a teacher is found dead and
    Brendel starts his investigation, which provides a thrilling read, filled with suspense
    and mystery. In 1956 Brendel returned in another chilling mystery, <i>The Case of the Four
    Friends: Diversion in Pre- Detection</i>, another minor classic. It is very difficult not
    to like this erudite, sophisticated and compassionate Viennese lawyer. However, it is a
    mystery why Masterman did not create other Brendel mysteries following the success of
    these two works. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Henry C. Bailey </font></b>was one of the acknowledged superstars of the
    Golden Period of British mystery. Bailey is best remembered for the fictional lawyer
    Joshua Clunk, a lawyer who strongly believes that end always justifies the means. Clunk is
    a family-minded man and resorts to brain rather than brawn in conducting his
    investigations. In <i>The Great Game</i> Clunk he deviously establishes doubt about police
    evidence to secure an open verdict. In <i>Slippery Ann</i>, Clunk gets a client acquitted
    but immediately initiates additional enquiry. Other novels <i>include The Wrong Man,</i> <i>The
    Little Captain</i> and <i>Shrouded Dead</i>. In short, Bailey entertains. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Anthony Gilbert</font></b> is the pseudonym of author Lucy Beatrice
    Malleson. She is famous for creating one of most interesting fictional lawyer-detectives
    of all time, &quot;the criminal's hope and judge's despair&quot; Arthur G. Crook, who has
    for a change not even one success to his name. Crook is a colourful, cheeky, hardworking
    middle-aged, cockney guy who, in spite of his diligence, occasionally lapses from standard
    professionalism. His office (like many a screen detective's) is shabby and in shambles.
    Crook is a regular 'hero to the rescue'. Though the regular plot is murder, the works are
    never redundant. Good works include <i>And Death Came Too, A Question of Murder, The
    Visitor </i>and<i> Death Wears. </i><b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Dr. R. Austin Freeman's</font></b> creation Dr. John Thorndyke<i><b>, </b></i>like
    the author, is both a doctor and a lawyer. Thorndyke remains as one of the most convincing
    scientific investigators in contemporary crime fiction. Accuracy of technical details,
    precise scientific investigation, etc, are the hallmarks of all Thorndyke novels. The
    medical-jurist's keen acumen both as a doctor and as a lawyer is revealed in all Thorndyke
    novels, the classic one being <i>The Cat's Eye</i>. <i>A Silent Witness </i>and<i> As A
    Thief in the Night</i> are rich in technical details. <i>Dr. Thorndyke Intervenes</i> is
    based on the Druce- Portland case of 1907. Freeman's ability to ring the changes from one
    Thorndyke case to the next is almost as remarkable a feat as his original conception of
    this great medical jurist.<b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Richard Lockridge </font></b>was a well-known, prolific crime writer. He
    has left his mark in legal fiction also with the character Bernie Simmons, an Assistant
    New York District Attorney. <i>And Left for the Dead</i> and <i>Devious Ones</i> are good
    Simmons novels. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">August W. Derleth </font></b>created Judge Ephraim Peck, a shrewd,
    elderly small town lawyer. As a crime writer or as a legal-fiction writer, Derleth's
    career was overshadowed by the other big names in legal fiction during the period. <i>Mischief
    in the Lane, Murder Stalks the Wakely Family </i>and<i> Man on All Fours </i>are best
    among the Derleth works. Derleth's plots, though good, lack finesse and polish, and this
    might account for the author's dismal performance as a legal-fiction author. Skip Derleth
    and you have missed nothing.<b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">C.W. Grafton</font></b> embarked on one of detective fiction's most
    original title patterns with the critically acclaimed <i>The Rat Began to Gnaw the Rope</i>.
    Following the lines of the old nursery rhyme Grafton could have completed a ten-volume
    series about Kentucky lawyer Gil Henry<i><b>.</b></i> That he stopped with<i> The Rat
    Began to Gnaw the Rope </i>and <i>The Rope Began to Hang the Butcher,</i> is regrettable
    not because of such tantalizing titles but because Henry was one of the most promising
    lawyer-detectives of the forties. The rapid plot movement and legal background recall Erle
    Stanley Gardner, especially <i>The Rope Began to Hang the Butcher,</i> in which Henry's
    fancy footwork would do Perry Mason proud. <i>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</i> is one of the
    finest non-Henry, Grafton works where a lawyer defends himself of a not-unjustified
    murder. Though the Henry novels are just two in number, Grafton has carved a niche in
    popular legal- fiction folklore. However, today Grafton is better known as the father of
    novelist Sue Grafton.<b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Marie Lowndes</font></b>, another non-lawyer and a descendant of Joseph
    Priestly and a prot�g�e of Robert Browning, drew on her knowledge of courts and lawyers
    and of recent crimes to produce a series of carefully plotted crime and suspense novels. <i>Lizzie
    Borden</i>, <i>Motive</i> and <i>The Chink in the Armour</i> traces the fallacies and
    shortcomings of the Marriage laws, whereby women become subject to the most cruel and
    degrading treatment at the hands of their spouses. <i>Lizzie Borden</i> and <i>Letty
    Lytton</i> involve lengthy inquests and trials all based on actual court scenes. Marie
    Lowndes provides an interesting read not only to the hardcore legal fiction lover but also
    to the reader who enjoys popular fiction.<b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Waynan Jones </font></b>(pseudonym for Norman Daniels)<b> </b>deserves
    his place over here, not because he is a great legal author, but because he has created
    the one and only super-hero lawyer in the wide world of fictional lawyers. He created a
    crime fighter, The Black Bat, who was really an attorney, Tony Quinn. Black Bat is a <i>Shadow
    </i>type of character. Good books include <i>Murder Town, Murder Calls Black Bat</i>, and <i>Voice
    of Doom</i>. Waynan Jones is a welcome 'change' in this category of legal authors. And
    speaking of comics, did you know that America's favourite teenager, Archie Andrews, of <i>Archie</i>
    Comics eventually became a lawyer? (See, <i>Riverdale: Fifteen Years Later</i>). </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Other good lawyers-turned-authors of this period included James M.
    Fox (pseudonym for J.M.W.Knipscheer), Benjamin Benson, Fergus Hume, Octavious Ray Cohen,
    Dornford Yates, Roy Fuller and C.H.B.Kitchin. They are good authors of popular fiction
    but, while none of their works can be included in the class of legal fiction, they will
    provide good reading for the connoisseur of crime fiction. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Verdana">THE SIXTIES TO EIGHTIES</font></b></font><font size="1"><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The sixties and seventies showed a severe dearth of legal authors.
    However it was in this period that one of the alll-time greatest works in legal fiction, <i>To
    Kill a Mockingbird</i>, was written. This Pulitzer-winning work by <b>Harper Lee </b>featured
    lawyer Atticus Finch, who defends a black man accused of raping a white girl. Atticus
    Finch was immortalized by Gregory Peck, who won an Oscar as best actor in the screen
    adaptation of the novel. Through the eyes of two children, Scott and Jem Finch, Harper Lee
    explored the irrationality and hypocrisy of adult attitudes about race and class in the
    Deep South of the thirties. A haunting and touching read, <i>To Kill a Mocking Bird</i>
    remains one of the classic works of all time and it would be a crime to the book, if it
    were just relegated to the status of legal fiction alone. Michigan Judge <b>Robert
    Traver's</b> <i>Anatomy of a Murder,</i> a courtroom drama, about a man accused of killing
    a man who raped his wife, had a controversial ending and was another acknowledged classic
    in legal fiction written during this period. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But apart from these works, good books in legal fiction were few
    and were far between. </font><b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">William Harrington </font></b>was an attorney who made his mark in legal
    fiction during this period and has continued his success into the nineties. He used his
    legal expertise as a specialist in courtroom drama. <i>Which The Justice, Which The Thief</i>,
    designed as a corrective to inaccurate media depictions of court room procedure, concerns
    the trial of a man and a woman accused of armed robbery of a jewel store. The clarity of
    the writing and the keen observation of people and institutions make this work a
    semi-classic in the realm of legal fiction. This work was followed by <i>Trial, </i>which
    deals with the politics of capital punishment, and<i> Power</i>, which are best sellers in
    their own right. Harrington returned to another courtroom drama with <i>Partners</i>, rich
    in ambiguity of the law and morality and the fact that truth and the appropriate verdict
    on evidence do not always coincide. Harrington's other works include <i>The Jupiter
    Crisis, Scorpio 5 </i>and<i> Skin Deep, </i>which are good thrillers but cannot fall into
    the category of legal fiction.<b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">George V. Higgins, </font></b>a graduate of the Boston Law School in
    Massachusetts and a former Attorney, has been associated with realistic dialogue,
    intricate plotting, and a persistent digging into the political, social and criminal
    landscapes of Greater Boston since the publication in 1972 of <i>The Friends of Eddie
    Coyle</i>. A year later came <i>The Diggers Game</i>, a best seller. Higgins speaks in a
    voice that rings with social conscience and aspires to the timbre of Dickens. Most books
    feature lawyer and a sort- of detective Jerry Kennedy<i><b>.</b></i> Good works include <i>Kennedy
    for the Defence</i>, <i>Penance for Jerry Kennedy, Cogan's Trade</i> and a <i>Choice of
    Enemies</i>. Higgins was the acknowledged superstar in this field during this period.
    However, since the eighties Higgins has more or less lost his charm as a legal author with
    the arrival of Grisham, Turow and Martini. Nevertheless, good books which made bestseller
    charts in spite of this hefty competition include <i>The Agent </i>and<i> A Change of
    Gravity.</i><b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Michael Gilbert,</font></b> a London Solicitor, authored the critically
    acclaimed masterpiece, <i>Smallbone Deceased</i>, which bridged the gap between classic
    whodunits and legal fiction. Though<i> Death of a Favourite Girl</i> and <i>Mr. Calder and
    Mr. Behrens</i> are other good works, they do not boast of the finesse of <i>Smallbone
    Deceased. </i>On the whole Gilbert's novels are not only plausible but also possess an
    unusual substance, not felt in many an author's works. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Eleazar Lipsky,</font></b> during a twenty year running writing career,
    authored many books including <i>Murder One</i> and<i> The Devils daughter</i>. In <i>Murder
    One</i>, Lipsky presents New York Asst. DA Esau Frost, who prosecutes a prostitute accused
    of murder. Behind-the-scenes courtroom action is a highlight of this novel. In <i>The
    Scientists</i> Lipsky presents a situation where a scientist is accused of usurping credit
    for the discovery of a wonder drug from a fellow scientist. (I believe this work to be the
    first one dealing with patent right in the field of legal fiction). <i>Malpractice </i>is
    an excellent courtroom drama on medical negligence. <i>The People Against O'Hara</i> <i>and
    Lincoln McKeever</i> are other good works of this author who achieved enviable success
    during this period.<b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Roderic Jeffries </font></b>is a best-selling novelist and author of more
    than 90 thrillers, most of them being of the whodunit type. However ,Jeffries' background
    in law and lawyering has been skillfully narrated in three great courtroom dramas. In <i>Evidence
    of the Accused</i>, two men, the husband and the lover are tried for the murder of a
    wealthy socialite. Each confesses to the crime while the other is being tried. The ending
    is a <i>tour de force</i>, which produces the murderer and leaves him free outside the
    reach of law. Like Agatha Christie's <i>Witness for the Prosecution</i> it keeps the
    reader guessing till the very end and is a page- turner in the real sense of the term. In
    an <i>An Embarrassing Death</i>, a person accused of murder undertakes his own defence
    without help of any lawyer. <i>Dead Against The Lawyers</i> is yet another riveting
    courtroom drama from this great lawyer-turned-whodunit storyteller.</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Among mystery writers who combine intelligence, wit and
    cleverness, it is hard to beat <b>Jane Langton</b>, whose novels feature Homer Kelly,
    attorney, scholar, and sometimes detective; they are not only entertaining but also
    instructive and thoughtful. Homer Kelly is tall, ungainly, ill-dressed and brilliant as a
    lawyer and a detective. In <i>The Transcendental Murder</i> Kelly investigates the murders
    of local amateur experts on the transcendentalists. <i>The Memorial Hall Murder</i> has
    Kelly investigating a crime among the Harvard Faculty. Kelly has traces of Perry Mason
    here and there, but in the world of fictitious lawyers Kelly occupies a special position. </font><b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Jack Ehrlich</font></b> was a writer who found his true metier as an
    author of westerns. However, the author has made his contribution to the realm of legal
    fiction also. In <i>Revenge</i>, Ehrlich put forward a unique theme. It briefly summarizes
    two trials of the protagonist, one as an advocate and the other as the defendant. A good
    read. In <i>Court Martial,</i> Ehrlich takes us into the world of Lt. Carl Richter ,a
    fill-in trial officer of the US Air Force, who tries the case of an officer accused of
    desertion. <i>The Girl Cage</i> is an interesting read into the plea of insanity regarding
    the mental competency of the only witness in a murder case. <i>The Drowning </i>and<i> The
    Chantham Killing</i> are other good works of this author. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Robert L. Fish</font></b> is best known for Sir Percival Pugh, whom we
    first encounter in <i>The Murder League</i>. Here three down-and-out elderly writers take
    to murder to gain publicity and show that they still have'it' in them. Pugh is faced with
    the difficulty of defending them. A good book with strong comic touches. This work was
    followed by two sequels, <i>Rub-a-Dub-Dub</i> and <i>A Gross Miscarriage of Justice</i>.
    In <i>A Handy Death</i>, attorney hank Ross defends a baseball player who is accused of
    murder, when the victim dies of injuries suffered as a result of the accused's assault
    eight years back. A good trial drama. Fish, I believe, is the only American author to
    realistically portray the British legal system in his works. Fish also is credited with
    creating the TV series <i>Trials of O'Brien</i>, which has been compiled in a short story
    collection with the same tittle. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Michael Underwood</font></b> is a Solicitor and crime writer who works
    largely by undramatic means. This might seem a contradiction. Crime and especially murder,
    is at first blush a strongly dramatic affair. But it is so only at first blush.
    Underwood's legal background conveys not only the full tedium of the crime but also covers
    a good deal of its sober progress from point to point. He does this by describing the
    course of investigation, the course of legal process and finally the court room scenes,
    which are all narrated in a wholly undramatic manner. Good works include <i>The</i> <i>Unprofessional
    Spy, Menaces, Menaces </i>and<i> Hand of Fate.</i><b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Evan Hunter</font></b> is the author of <i>A Matter of Conviction, The
    Paper Dragon </i>and<i> Three Blind Mice. A Matter of Conviction</i> is about juvenile
    delinquency where three young men are accused of murder. <i>The Paper Dragon</i> is a
    fascinating exploration into the world of writers and publishers and into the law of
    copyright. Evan Hunter has continued his success into the nineties also, one of the few
    authors of this period to achieve distinction in spite of the presence of genre
    specialists Grisham and Turow. <i>Lizzie</i> takes us to the life of Lizzie Borden
    (earlier explored by Marie Lowndes). Under the pseudonym <b>Ed McBain</b> Hunter created
    Florida lawyer-sleuth Mathew Hope, who in <i>Three Blind Mice</i> defends a wealthy tomato
    grower of murder of Vietnamese immigrants; in <i>Mary, Mary</i> he defends a school
    teacher of murder. Ed McBain is more a nineties writer than Evan Hunter. This change of
    name might well account for Hunter gaining success in the nineties. <i>Gladly The Cross-
    Eyed Bear</i> is another good Hope novel. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Sara Woods </font></b>is best remembered for her creation, the barrister,
    Anthony Maitland,<i><b> </b></i>'a barrister who never loses a case'. Her forty-eight
    Maitland works are a fascinating study of the English legal system and explore the way
    that barristers, solicitors and police try to see justice done within the sometimes
    frustrating boundaries of the system, an insight into which is found in Wood's critically
    acclaimed <i>Bloody Instructions</i>. Woods' books are more than Perry Mason-like accounts
    of trials. Each case study builds logically to a courtroom climax. Case studies include
    child custody battles as in <i>Most Deadly Hate</i>, art theft <i>(Cry Guilty)</i>, libel <i>(Enter
    a Gentle Woman)</i>, and even amnesia as in <i>Defy the Devil</i>. On the whole Anthony
    Maitland books are interesting mysteries that provide pleasant puzzles and an insight into
    the law at work. They ought not to be read one after another as they can seem much alike
    after a while, but as most things, as part of a mixed diet they are fine. </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Throughout his legal career--as a private attorney, county
    prosecutor, state legislator and trial judge-- <b>Joe L. Hensley</b> has kept up a second
    career as a mystery writer. Hensley's tone is quiet and low-keyed; his pace is unfrenetic
    and unhurried and he has a nice talent for character drawing. The majority of his books
    deal with the crusading Bington criminal lawyer Donald Robak. Hensley has little interest
    in fireworks displays of legal ingenuity in the Gardner tradition, and his novels tend to
    avoid the courtroom. The offenders vary from a female juvenile defender as in<i> Minor
    Murders </i>to a disgraced former cop as in <i>Outcasts.</i> Hensley is at his best in <i>Robak's
    Cross,</i> which has, for a change, more courtroom action than all Robak novels put
    together. </font><b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Lawrence Block</font></b>, the prolific thriller author, though he had no
    formal training in law, has also tried his hand at legal fiction. He has created New York
    lawyer Martin Ehrengraf, who can at best be referred to as the black sheep among fictional
    lawyers. Randolph Mason might have been unscrupulous but he is no match for the
    deviousness of Ehrengraf, whose philosophy and style of practice make Mason look like a
    saint. He was featured in several stories including <i>The Ehrengraf Method</i> and in <i>The
    Ehrengraf Presumption</i>. In <i>The Ehrengraf Method</i>, the protagonist arranges for
    the release of his client, a serial killer, by the simple ploy of committing murder in the
    same style when his client is in jail. In <i>The Ehrengraf Presumption, </i>the lawyer
    gets the Client A off on a murder charge by framing B for the crime; then takes on B as a
    client and gets him off by framing C. During this period, as I said earlier, legal-
    fiction faced a lull, and the legal profession was held in contempt; and this might have
    accounted for the success of Ehrengraf novels, which were a pure snub of the world of the
    law and lawyers. </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">And finally, there was <b>Edward Grierson</b>, a
    lawyer-turned-writer who took to fiction but did not stick with legal fiction alone and
    has won fame as an international thriller author of repute. However, his best work on law
    is <i>The Second</i> <i>Man,</i> about the trials of a lady barrister, both in and out of
    the court, and won for him the British Crime Writer award in 1956. <i>Reputation for a
    Song</i> is a composed study of a domestic murder and a good courtroom drama. The suspense
    is not in finding the identity of the murderer, but in finding whether he will hang. <i>The
    Massingham Affair </i>and <i>A Crime of One's Own</i> are other good legal works of
    Grierson. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">But, as I said, legal fiction faced a lull in this period. Good
    books were rare and great authors, only a handful.</font><font size="3"><b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">THE NINETIES &amp; AFTER </font></b></font><font size="1"><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The late 1970's and early 80's showed a slump in the field of
    legal fiction. But in the late eighties the arrival of two youngsters into this field
    transformed the face of legal fiction forever. John Grisham<b> </b>and<b> </b>Scott Turow
    have made legal fiction the Ain thing@ in the field of popular crime fiction. The
    publication of Turow's <i>Presumed Innocent </i>in 1987electrified the legal-fiction genre
    and prompted even many a non-legal author to start writing about law and lawyers. A number
    of women authors have also achieved stupendous success with the creative use of the law in
    this period. In this category I have clubbed lawyer- writers and non-lawyer writers,
    though the majority among them are lawyers-turned-authors. More than one hundred authors
    have gained popularity as legal authors during this period. </font><b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">John Grisham, </font></b>as a young lawyer, took to fiction as a pass
    time. His<i> </i>first work was the critically acclaimed <i>A Time to Kill</i>. It was a
    story of white lawyer defending a black American accused of killing, in an open court, two
    white teen-agers who raped his twelve-year-old daughter, a sort of a 'reverse <i>To Kill A
    Mockingbird'</i>. But it was with the success of his next work <i>The Firm</i> that
    Grisham leapt into the league of best-selling authors. The book became a movie starring
    Tom Cruise. It was the story of a young lawyer who single-handedly moves against the Mafia
    that has a stranglehold over his Firm and its partners. The publication of<i> The Chamber </i>secured
    critical acclaim to Grisham once again. It was a story of a young lawyer defending his
    grandfather, an erstwhile member of the Ku-Klux clan accused of murder. <i>The Rainmaker</i>
    dealt with the trials and difficulties of a young lawyer struggling to make a mark in his
    profession. <i>The Pelican Brief</i> was another chiller thriller: what do you do if a
    judge stands in the way of your winning the case? Simple, just kill the judge. It was a
    story of a young woman (played wonderfully by Julia Roberts in the screen version) who
    discovered this truth and the danger she faced in trying to bring the guilty to the book. <i>The
    Runaway Jury</i> showed how the jury system could be manipulated so as to achieve the
    verdict one desires. The book dealt with the case of a compensation claim against a
    tobacco-manufacturing company for causing cancer to smokers. In the book heavy damages
    were paid. It is ironic that soon after the release of this book an American Jury awarded
    a huge compensation to the wife of a person who died of cancer caused due to smoking. <i>The
    Client, The Partner, The Testament, </i>and<i> The Brethren</i>, though bestsellers, could
    not boast of the legal-thrill, which was the hallmark of other Grisham works. However, the
    publication of <i>The Street Lawyer</i>, a story about a lawyer who grows disgusted with
    his money-oriented profession and turns to social interest litigation, provides an
    interesting read. The author's next work, <i>A Painted House,</i> is expected to hit the
    stands in early 2001.Grisham also wrote the screenplay for the movie <i>The Gingerbread
    Man.</i> A gripping narration and a fast-paced theme are the secrets of Grisham's success.
    <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Scott Turow's </font></b>Harvard Law School training, recorded in <i>One
    L</i>, a non-fiction description of his experiences as a first-year law student, has
    provided a solid legal foundation for his novels. The result is five hard-hitting,
    thought-provoking novels that go beyond the limitations of the mystery genre to face the
    illusory nature of reality and what is meant by justice. Though <i>Pleading Guilty, Laws
    of Our Fathers</i> and <i>Personal Injuries</i> have become best sellers, it is still his
    first two books, <i>Presumed Innocent </i>and<i> Burden of Proof</i> by which Turow is
    identified. If Grisham based all his novels in Memphis, it was Kindle County that formed
    the background of all of Turow's works. <i>Presumed Innocent</i> captures the
    investigation scene, the suspense and the internal maneuverings of a headline trial where
    the prosecuting attorney himself is accused of the murder of his mistress. Told in the
    first person, from the viewpoint of Rusty Sabich, the accused prosecutor, it traces the
    moral dilemma, confusion and ethical confrontation of Sabich and his lawyer Sandy Stern.
    The result is a first class thriller, which later became a movie starring Harrison Ford.
    Turow's next work, <i>Burden of Proof,</i> traced the personal trials of Sandy Stern, who
    came home one day to find that his wife had committed suicide and showed how he balanced
    his professional obligations and his personal tragedies. Turow's sense of courtroom
    finesse and skill at misdirection is clearly revealed in these two thrillers and is a
    must-read for every legal-fiction lover. Turow's latest novel, <i>Personal Injuries</i>,
    centers on lawyer Rob Feaver, who bribes judges who decide his cases. Though not as
    exciting as <i>Presumed Innocent, Personal Injuries</i> does provide a good read.
    Incidentally Turow also has edited a short story collection, <i>Guilty as Charged</i>. </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Traditionally, legal fiction has been restricted to novels. But <b>John
    Mortimer</b> has broken the shackles and introduced the short story into this realm.
    Mortimer describes himself as a 'writer who does some barristering', though he has been a
    defense lawyer since 1948. His creation Horace Rumpole is yet another example of the
    creation becoming more famous than the creator. Rumpole can no doubt be referred to as
    England's favorite defense barrister. He is a fearless tamer of judges (often addressing
    them as 'old darling or 'sweetheart'), but always kept in order by 'She Who Must Be
    Obeyed' (Rumpole's wife Hilda). Rumpole is known, not surprisingly, as a 'character.' His
    exploits at the Old Bailey, an unsurpassable blend of eloquence, wit, cynicism and
    experience, are collected in eleven wonderful short story collections including <i>Rumpole
    for the Defence, Rumpole a la Carte </i>and <i>The Trials of Rumpole.</i> Critics have
    praised Rumpole to the best mock-heroic fatty since Falstaff and as the nearest thing to
    the Wodehousian perfection of Jeeves stories. Rumpole stories have won for Mortimer, the
    prestigious British Academy Writer of the Year Award. Rumpole also became a television
    series starring Leo McKern. In addition to the Rumpole series John Mortimer also has
    written some great law dramas, including <i>The Dock Brief</i>, a touching story of an
    unsuccessful barrister who finds it difficult to make ends meet, and also has edited <i>Famous
    Trials</i>, a non-fiction work about great English criminal trials.</font><b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Steve Martini</font></b> is an exception among legal authors in the sense
    that he was an author before he became a lawyer. Martini's first novel ,<i>The Simeon
    Chamber</i>, was followed by <i>Compelling Evidence</i>, starring attorney Paul Madriani<i><b>,
    </b></i>about a highly charged murder trial, and has been translated into almost fifteen
    languages. Following its success Martini wrote <i>Prime Witness,</i> another Madriani
    thriller, and yet another bestseller. But it was <i>Undue Influence</i>, published in
    1994, that won Martini international fame as a legal author. This book is an unputdownable
    courtroom drama keeping the reader at tenterhooks till the very end. Martini, before
    becoming a full-time novelist, was a journalist specializing in law issues. Later ,as a
    lawyer, he also had the privilege of drafting numerous legislation for the California
    Legislature. Martini has followed the success of <i>Undue Influence </i>with<i> The List,
    The Judge, The Attorney</i> (featuring Madriani)<i> </i>and<i> Critical Mass. </i>His
    latest book <i>The Jury</i> is expected to hit the stands in early 2001. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Richard North Patterson</font></b> is a lawyer writer who stands along
    with Grisham, Martini and Turow as best- selling legal authors, not only in Europe and
    America but also in India. A former Assistant Attorney General of Ohio and a reputed trial
    lawyer in Washington, he was also involved in the Special Prosecutor team covering the
    Watergate Scandal. Law and politics and their interplay are the basic themes of Patterson
    novels and are best revealed in his bestsellers. However, his novels also bear a high
    sense of righteousness and ethics. His first novel, <i>The Lasko Tangent, </i>won the
    Edgar Allan Poe Award in 1979. The book was a result of his experiences as a trial lawyer
    during the Watergate Scandal and is loosely based on the same. This was followed by <i>The
    Outside Man, Escape the Night </i>and<i> Private Screening</i>. His works <i>Degree of
    Guilt </i>and<i> Eyes of a Child </i>both feature attorney Christopher Paget of <i>The
    Lasko Tangent</i> fame. Patterson was awarded the French Grand <i>Prix de Littt</i>'<i>erateur
    Polici'ere</i> award in 1995. <i>The Final Judgment, Silent Witness, No Safe Place,
    Protect and Defend</i> and <i>Dark Lady</i> are other good books by Richard North
    Patterson.<b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Willam J. Coughlin</font></b> was a late-comer to legal fiction. His
    contributions to legal fiction are just five in number, written between 1988 and 1992,
    before his death in 1993. In <i>Her Honor</i> Coughlin presented Kathleen Talbot a judge
    who falls in love with an attorney whose case she is trying. A courtroom drama of the
    first order, it also provides an in-depth study about the justifiability of euthanasia. <i>In
    The Presence of Enemies</i> is a courtroom drama about the legacy of a multi-millionaire,
    who left too much to his 'young fourth wife.' However, Coughlin is best remembered for
    Detroit lawyer Charley Sloan, who first appears in the whodunit courtroom drama <i>Shadow
    of a Doubt</i>, which has been referred to as the classic Coughlin. <i>Death Penalty, Day
    of Wrath, Heart of Justice</i> and <i>The Judgement</i> are other good Coughlin works. <b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Sol Stein</font></b> started his career in the mid-seventies but attained
    popularity only in the early eighties. Stein is the creator of ace defense lawyer George
    Thomassy, a very skilled advocate who gives the best for his clients, whether guilty or
    not. In <i>The Magician</i>, Thomassy investigates the assault and battery committed on an
    amateur magician while in <i>Other People</i> Thomassy defends a strong-willed rape
    victim. <i>The Touch of Treason</i> is another good work.<b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Lisa Scottoline </font></b>practiced as a trial lawyer in Philadelphia
    before turning to full-time legal fiction. She had also served as a law clerk in the
    Pennsylvania Circuit Court of Appeals. Her first novel, <i>Everywhere That Mary Went</i>,
    was nominated for the Edgar Award, while her second novel, <i>Final Appeal,</i> won the
    Edgar. Her great works include <i>Rough Justice, Legal Tender </i>and<i> Running From the
    Law. Mistaken Identity</i> is another good work by Scottoline. It seems that she derived
    her inspiration to write this novel, a story about a lawyer defending her twin accused of
    murder, after meeting her half-sister, about whom Scottoline came to know about only very
    recently. Scottoline is one of the few women legal authors who have attained best seller
    status, the first since Craig Rice in the forties. <i>People Magazine </i>has called her
    'the female Grisham.' Her books have been translated into more than twenty languages.
    Scottoline's latest work, <i>A Moment of Truth,</i> has just hit the best seller charts in
    Europe and U.S. It is just a matter of time before Scottoline makes it as big as Martini
    and Turow have in India.<b><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">A. W. Gray</font></b>, through his pseudonym <b>Sarah Gregory,</b> has
    won the title of 'another female Grisham' and has created the Texas sleuth and lawyer
    Sharon Hays. Sharon Hays has appeared in more than four novels. <i>Public Trust, The Best
    Defense, Capitol Hill </i>and <i>In Self Defense </i>are good books by Gregory. In <i>In
    Self Defense</i>, Sharon defends the daughter of a multi-millionaire accused of killing
    her father. To add <i>masala</i>, there is the presence of a psychotic killer who is bent
    on killing Hays, all culminating in a good courtroom drama. In <i>In Best Defense</i>,
    Sharon Hays defends a Hollywood actress accused of murdering an actor. A good read but is
    reminiscent of certain whodunit type books of Agatha Christie. </p>
