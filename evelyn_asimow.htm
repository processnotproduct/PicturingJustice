            <i>Evelyn</i> are the three wonderful lawyers (all played by
            great actors) who rally to Desmond's side. They do it out of
            principle and human compassion, not for money. It's all pro bono.
            We seldom see this kind of lawyer in the movies anymore.</font></center>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">And now for Picturing Justice's
                  award for the best legal movie of 2002. And the winner is&#133;<i>Evelyn</i>!
                  (At least, that's my vote) Granted the 2002 competition wasn't
                  all that stiff, but still, this is a film that all fans of law
                  and popular culture should see.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/evelyn3.jpg" width="179" height="118" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Evelyn</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">, directed by Bruce Beresford and closely
                  based on real events, is set in mid-1950's Ireland. In the film,
                  the Doyles have three children (actually they had six, five boys
                  and a girl). Evelyn, the oldest, is seven years old. The Dad,
                  Desmond (Pierce Brosnan), is unemployed. The mom, Charlotte,
                  deserts the family and vanishes. Unable to support his family,
                  Desmond agrees to turn them over to &quot;industrial schools&quot;
                  (actually austere Catholic facilities for orphans or destitute
                  children). The judge who rules that the committal is valid urged
                  Desmond &quot;not to leave the child in the school for long.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">About six months later, employed
                  and equipped with a live-in girlfriend and &quot;housekeeper,&quot;
                  Desmond wants the kids back, but is thwarted by an arbitrary
                  provision of the Family Law Act, 1941. Under that law, in cases
                  of death or desertion of a spouse, the custodial parent can transfer
                  custody to an industrial school. However, if the Ministry of
                  Education opposes releasing the children, both parents must petition
                  to get them out--and Charlotte has disappeared. The Ministry
                  of Education exercised its discretion to hang on to the kids.
                  As far as Desmond's legal rights to the kids are concerned, the
                  Ministry reads the Family Law Act literally and refuses to turn
                  over the kids--it takes one parent to sign 'em in but two to
                  sign 'em out. The provision seems arbitrary, perhaps even an
                  inadvertent drafting error, but there it is.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Thus little Evelyn (a dazzling
                  Sophie Vavasseur) is stuck in St. Josephs; she's well treated
                  by most of the nuns but slapped around by Sister Bridget who
                  runs the place. The boys are in a different Catholic institution.
                  And Desmond becomes more and more frantic as he gets the old
                  run around from the bureaucracy.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Finally, he's referred to solicitor
                  Michael Beattie (Stephen Rea). Beattie and Irish/American barrister
                  Nick Barron (Aidan Quinn) are firmly rebuffed by a High Court
                  judge. The actual decision is In re Doyle [1956] Irish Reports
                  217. The three-judge decision declares that the statute means
                  what it says. Although the movie portrays the trial judge as
                  very hostile, in fact the judges were sympathetic. One judge
                  remarked: &quot;No adjective I can think of could adequately
                  express the degree of reluctance with which I conclude that&quot;
                  Doyle is entitled to no relief.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The High Court's decision reads
                  like an example of extreme legal positivism. The text of a statute
                  is sacred, judges cannot engage in any kind of mildly creative
                  or purposive interpretation. Surely &quot;parents&quot; means
                  &quot;parent&quot; when the other one has vanished. Moreover,
                  the idea that a statute should be construed to avoid constitutional
                  objections was apparently unknown to the judges (they said there
                  was no precedent for such an argument). The judges do not even
                  discuss Desmond's claim of estoppel (since the original committing
                  judge led him to believe he could get the kids back as soon as
                  he was able to care for them).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Now joined by a feisty retired
                  barrister (Alan Bates), Desmond heads for the Irish Supreme Court,
                  seeking to have the statute declared invalid under several provisions
                  of the Irish constitution of 1937 that protect parental rights.
                  Indeed, the constitution has provisions that seem amazingly on
                  point. Article 41.1 provides that the family possesses &quot;inalienable
                  and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive
                  law.&quot; Article 42.1 protects the &quot;inalienable right
                  and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for
                  the . . . education of their children.&quot; Article 42.3.1 provides
                  that &quot;The State shall not oblige parents . . . to send their
                  children to schools established by the State.&quot; <br>
<br>
                  In the film, we see a dramatic argument by counsel and a cliff-hanger
                  decision: by a 2-1 vote, the Supreme Court holds the statute
                  conflicts with the constitution and is invalid. The film suggests
                  that this case was the first in which the Irish Supreme Court
                  exercised its power of judicial review over a statute. In fact,
                  there were cases before Doyle in which the Irish Supreme Court
                  invalidated statutes, but very few. (Starting in the 1960's,
                  there were many) So the case is a true landmark, not only in
                  family law but in Irish constitutional law. For some unknown
                  reason, the Supreme Court's decision in Doyle was not published
                  in the Irish Reports in 1955 but was finally published in 1989.
                  In re Doyle [1989] Irish Law Rep. Monthly 277.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The film is faithful to the
                  actual events that transpired in 1953 through 1955. The filmmakers
                  deserve praise for attempting to convey the big picture of this
                  historic constitutional dispute fairly and accurately; the inevitable
                  departures from historic truth are relatively minor and do not
                  change the big picture. In my view, the filmmakers have discharged
                  their responsibility as creators of a film that claims to be
                  based on a true story. They have told the truth in a broad sense,
                  which is all you can ask of a product designed and marketed as
                  an entertainment vehicle.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The actual written decisions
                  in the Doyle cases explain some aspects of the film that seem
                  puzzling. In the film, the same hostile judge sits in the High
                  Court (the trial court) and then on the Supreme Court. This didn't
                  happen; there was no overlap between the judges of the two courts
                  (and none of the High Court judges were hostile). The trial court
                  did not deny leave to appeal. The lawyers did not overlook the
                  constitutional issue; they first exhausted non-constitutional
                  issues through a mandamus action in the High Court (including
                  an argument that the Family Law Act should be construed in light
                  of its possible constitutional invalidity). They then brought
                  a subsequent habeas corpus case in the High Court, leading to
                  a trial and a decision (apparently unreported) in which the judges
                  indicated that they would upheld Doyle's constitutional claim;
                  as then required by statute, the High Court certified the issue
                  to the Supreme Court for a final decision. The Supreme Court's
                  decision was unanimous, not split (indeed the 1937 Constitution
                  prohibits non-unanimous opinions).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Apparently Evelyn Doyle sold
                  her story to the movies but was displeased with the script. She
                  published her version of the events in <i>Tea and Green Ribbons:
                  A Memoir</i> (2002). In the book, Evelyn says she was never mistreated
                  by the nuns. (And there is no reference to any claim of physical
                  abuse in either of the published Doyle decisions). Evelyn's years
                  in the industrial school were happy ones. Similarly, the boys
                  were quite happy in their school. Indeed, Evelyn felt ambivalent
                  about going home since she disliked Jessie Brown, her father's
                  girlfriend (Jessie Brown is called Bernadette Beattie in the
                  film). (Remember, Ireland had no divorce during this period so
                  Desmond couldn't marry Jessie). If Evelyn's account can be trusted,
                  the film diverges from the real events in its depiction of the
                  slapping incident. That apparently fictitious event made the
                  film more dramatic (and the incident resonates with contemporary
                  audiences because of the horrible sexual abuse scandals in the
                  Catholic church).<br>
<br>
                  Evelyn's memoir also helps to explain why the Minister's fought
                  the case to the bitter end, rather than yielding custody to Desmond
                  as it had discretion to do under the Family Law Act. After all,
                  beds in these facilities must have been at a premium and caring
                  for the children was costly. Why would the Ministry insist on
                  holding on to children who have a parent willing and able to
                  care for them?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The memoir suggests that the
                  real reason was that Jessie Brown was Church of England, not
                  Roman Catholic. This suggests that the back story of Evelyn should
                  have been about the government's and the clergy's policy to keep
                  the children away from a non-Catholic mother. If this theme had
                  been introduced into the story, it would have deepened the political
                  impact of the film and would have helped viewers understand why
                  the Ministry was acting in such an apparently irrational manner.
                  The fact that this theme is left out of the movie suggests that
                  the filmmakers were prepared to criticize an individual nun but
                  not to make a political attack on the Irish Church hierarchy.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">To my mind, the best parts
                  of <i>Evelyn</i> are the three wonderful lawyers (all played
                  by great actors) who rally to Desmond's side. They do it out
                  of principle and human compassion, not for money. It's all pro
                  bono. We seldom see this kind of lawyer in the movies anymore.
                  (Robert Morton in <i>The Winslow Boy</i> in 1999 was another
                  admirable pro bono lawyer). We're more accustomed to seeing attorneys
                  like Rita Harrison in <i>I Am Sam</i> (2001) or Gavin Banek in
                  <i>Changing Lanes</i> (2002)--greedy, heartless, unethical, obnoxious
                  creeps. Not so in <i>Evelyn</i>: Desmond Doyle's attorneys represent
                  our profession at its very best. These are the kinds of lawyers
                  that each of us would like to be.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The film is also noteworthy
                  because it is about a fundamental principle of constitutional
                  law--the right of parents to make fundamental decisions about
                  the lives and education of their children. It's a principle that
                  the lawyers in <i>Evelyn</i> argue at length and that the Irish
                  Supreme Court addresses and upholds. (Although the U. S. constitution
                  lacks explicit provisions like those in the Irish constitution,
                  it's likely that the result would be the same under substantive
                  due process; indeed several U. S. Supreme Court cases, Pierce
                  v. Society of Sisters and Meyer v. Nebraska, as well as Marbury
                  v. Madison, were cited to the Irish Supreme Court but not relied
                  on in the decision). It's rare that serious constitutional themes
                  are treated in popular culture, but judicial review of statutes
                  is such a fundamental and dramatic part of our legal system (as
                  well as the Irish system) that it deserves much more frequent
                  treatment than it receives.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Evelyn is one of a string of
                  excellent films involving child custody disputes that seek to
                  make a legal or political point. In each film, obviously deserving
                  and empathetic adults seek the custody of adorable children--and
                  are thwarted by an unfeeling bureaucracy or perverse legal rules
                  or practices. <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i> (1979) is the most prominent
                  member of this subgenre--the legal system blindly prefers the
                  mother over the father regardless of the child's best interests.
                  It was followed by such memorable films as <i>Losing Isaiah</i>
                  (1995) (trans-racial adoption) and <i>I Am Sam</i> (parental
                  rights of retarded parents). Indeed, the beloved <i>A Thousand
                  Clowns</i> (1965) and <i>The Champ</i> (1931 and 1979) are honored
                  members of the club. <i>Evelyn</i> strongly resembles these films.
                  It involves a deserving parent, nice little kids, perverse legal
                  rules, and a bureaucracy apparently intent on wresting children
