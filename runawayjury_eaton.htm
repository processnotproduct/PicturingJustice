                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">God, grant me the serenity<br>
                  to accept the things I cannot change,<br>
                  the courage to change the things I can,<br>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">--the Serenity Prayer of
                  Alcoholics Anonymous</font></i></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As an avid fan of anything
                  written by John Grisham, I was drunk on human sensation and heart-pounding
                  danger. Insurance corporations, angry mobs, the mob, anti-establishment
                  sentiment, assaults, disease and explosions, are all classic
                  Grisham themes. <i>The Runaway Jury</i> is excellently produced,
                  directed and best of all, written. It considers the most mundane
                  of civic tasks, jury duty, which is as loathsome and inescapable
                  to us as our daily chores.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/runawayjury2.jpg" width="184" height="123" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The
                  film challenges our common &quot;oops, missed it&quot; attitude
                  about jury duty. And since the film, I've personally discovered
                  the devil in legal process details, and have yet to stop thinking
                  about these characters who have been smoothly shaken (not stirred)
                  by sophisticated individual agendas.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The film opens with a disgruntled
                  ex-stock broker gunning down his colleagues, as seen from the
                  life of Jacob Woods. Dylan McDermott plays the slaughtered victim,
                  who, ironically, was unceremoniously dumped from <i>the Practice</i>,
                  a TV show now irredeemable from its glorious past. <i>The Runaway
                  Jury</i> also seeks to redeem its violent past. It adds many
                  coincidences of incidents that parallel real life, giving them
                  greater unpredictable dimension. The audience's attention over
                  hunger and thirst is ignored to focus in on its presented issues:
                  Columbine-type flashbacks, unreported legal ethical violations
                  by all parties, and invasions of privacy no government would
                  even think of perpetrating. It is a thrilling sleeper that has
                  me hooked!<br>
<br>
                  Money, as always, is the driving force. It is a curse and addiction,
                  made before by buying a movie ticket and necessary evil for a
                  happy-ever-after box office ending. The film has lived up to
                  its Hollywood hype, but unfortunately the audience isn't buying
                  it in the theater venue. This same philosophic view, ironically,
                  has been put forth inside the film.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As the character Rankin Fitch
                  says &quot;Trials are too important to be left up to juries.&quot;
                  This latest masterwork of film is NOT for people who can't think
                  for themselves. They won't appreciate the artistry and talent
                  it took to bring this dull and witless topic to life. All the
                  characters keep the audience wondering what will happen next
                  because they each have so many choices to make, even after they
                  have decided on their particular course of action.<br>
<br>
                  The chameleon protagonist Marlee/Gabrielle portrayed by Rachel
                  Weisz adds a brilliant touch of elegance, and another member
                  to Grisham's growing list of intelligent female characters (at
                  last!). Its true drama involves planted juror Nick Easter (deftly
                  played by coy John Cusack) vs. jury consultant Rankin Fitch (this
                  role is owned by classic humanitur Gene Hackman), not the widow
                  Woods employing New Orleans homeboy Wendell Rohr (guilessly played
                  by the effervescent Dustin Hoffman) to sue the gun manufacturers
                  for loss of consortium. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There are no settlements here,
                  which probably is what would have happened in a real courtroom.
                  Our deepest fears about lawyers have been illuminated by the
                  lack of importance the courtroom has in the film. All the attorneys
                  put other interests first, and serve their clients only to the
                  extent they profit from such contact. This film is a testimonial
                  to the survival of the most greedy.<br>
<br>
                  <i>The Runaway Jury</i> ham-handedly deals with gun manufacturers.
                  Oddly none of the characters makes any use of a gun. They break
                  walls and smash windows, set fires, destroy equipment, stalk,
                  photograph, phone, threaten, bribe with millions and cajole at
                  their whims, but not one of the main characters wields a gun.
                  The hot topic of gun control is second to the perpetual confrontations
                  of the characters. As anti-climatic as it may be, selling guns
                  is the raison d'etre for the manipulations to gain power, revenge,
                  and money. But this is only briefly explained after the case
                  is won.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The same trial-style has been
                  done in real life with tobacco cases, and less successfully with
                  pharmaceuticals and alcohol lawsuits. The end of this case is
                  just another moment in a judicial process that can't live up
                  to its promise because its participants see the case only as
                  their opportunity to cash in.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The sides in this film are
                  given early on, the audience need only ponder the &quot;what-ifs,&quot;
                  therein eagerly to participate and explore further into its issues.
                  As with all Hollywood endings, the entirety of fixing a jury
                  without being caught comes down to a conscience with multiple
                  directions (similar to string theory in the field of physics)
                  and an astonishing lack of universality that barely avoids preachy
                  moralism. Being right wins the case, retiring the evil and cashing
                  in all in one fell swoop relieves some pain and suffering of
                  the past. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Each victory is fragile and
                  temporary, as life is, as human beings are.<br>
                  The Serenity Prayer goes on: <i>&quot;Living one day at a time,
                  enjoying one moment at a time, accepting hardship as the pathway
                  to peace. Taking, as He did, this sinful world as it is, not
                  as I would have it. Trusting that He will make all things right
                  if I surrender to His will. That I may be reasonably happy in
                  this life, and supremely happy with Him forever in the next.
                  Amen.&quot;</i></font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Then, again, for further subornation
                  of process, there is always the<br>
                  appeal....</font></p>
