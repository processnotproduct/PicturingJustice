                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I thought the original <i>Legally
                  Blond</i>e (2001) was pretty good. It was smart and clever and
                  successfully poked fun at the Harvard Law School and a whole
                  lot of other sacred institutions. (Who could forget the delicious
                  spoof of the Admissions Committee seeking diversity by admitting
                  a California airhead?) Reese Witherspoon was terrific in the
                  role.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/blonde4.jpg" width="137" height="201" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Unfortunately,
                  I have to agree with the critics: the sequel, <i>Legally Blonde
                  2: Red, White, and Blonde</i>, is disappointing. I thought the
                  jokes fell flat (although most people in the theater were laughing).
                  The premise of the blonde bombshell being a lot smarter than
                  she looks was barely strong enough to support the first movie
                  and couldn't carry the sequel. <br>
<br>
                  But you know what? I think the movie is a valuable contribution
                  to popular culture and I'm glad it got made. Let's not forget--pop
                  culture is the greatest teacher that the world has ever known.
                  Most people get most of their information and opinions from the
                  news and from pop culture sources. As many studies (under the
                  heading of &quot;cultivation theory&quot;) have shown, people
                  forget that the data on which they base many of their opinions
                  came from fictitious stories on TV or in the movies. They don't
                  &quot;source discount&quot; that data to take account of the
                  fact that it came from fiction. Under another theoretical approach
                  found in cultural theory (&quot;active audience&quot;),viewers
                  give the material their own spin, often coming up with interpretations
                  at variance with those intended by the creators of the film or
                  TV show. <br>
                  How many movies have dealt with the legislative process? There
                  have been quite a few movies and TV shows about the presidency,
                  and a few on the Supreme Court, but how many can you name about
                  Congress? Right--<i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> (1939),
                  the Frank Capra-James Stewart classic. Perhaps one in a thousand
                  young people have seen it. The same for <i>Advise and Consent</i>
                  (1962) which concerns Senatorial consideration of a presidential
                  appointment. And now, what else do you have? A couple of interesting
                  films concern Congressional campaigns--<i>The Candidate</i> (1972)
                  and <i>Bulworth</i> (1998) come to mind--and there have been
                  a few films about Congressional investigations (especially HUAC)--but
                  how about pictures that dwell on the lawmaking process? Aside
                  from <i>Mr. Smith</i>, and a couple of ancient westerns like
                  Gene Autry's <i>Rovin' Tumbleweeds</i> (1939), and a few forgotten
                  TV shows and Simpson parodies , I can't think of any. Given the
                  centrality of pop culture in our civic life, and the tremendous
                  importance of what happens on Capital Hill, that is a major gap.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In <i>Legally Blonde 2</i>,
                  Elle Woods develops an interest in banning animal testing after
                  discovering that her dog's mother is a captive of a cosmetics
                  company. She's working at a big Boston law firm and is undergoing
                  her annual review. When she suggests that the firm do something
                  to influence its cosmetics-firm client to stop animal testing,
                  she is fired on the spot. The partners are appalled that anyone
                  could even mention trying to do the right thing when it comes
                  to client relations. (Big law firms always get sliced and diced
                  in the movies).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So, pretty in pink as always,
                  Elle heads for DC, accompanied by her Chihuahua Bruiser (Moondoggie).
                  She's got a job working on the staff of a Congresswoman Victoria
                  Rudd (Sally Field) who is pushing an animal testing bill. (The
                  film carefully distances itself from the much more controversial
                  issue of medical animal testing, where it would have offended
                  large parts of its audience, and sticks to the more benign subject
                  of cosmetics testing).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Elle soon learns that money
                  controls politics when her boss sells her out because the big
                  bad Boston cosmetics firm threatens to fund her opponent unless
                  she drops the bill. So Elle starts to shed her hopeless naivete
                  about the legislative process. She converts the majority and
                  minority ranking members of the relevant committee to her cause.
                  Nevertheless, the bill won't move so she starts a discharge petition
                  process which requires 218 signatures to force the bill to the
                  floor of the House for a vote. (It is unclear why a discharge
                  petition was needed given that the leadership of the relevant
                  committee supported the bill and so it could have passed through
                  the committee and gone to the floor in the normal manner).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Here's where we get to the
                  part I liked. Elle mounts a massive PR campaign in favor of the
                  bill, assisted by Sid Post (Bob Newhart), a savvy DC veteran
                  who is working as her doorman. Here the assistance of her sorority
                  sisters in Delta Nu becomes critical--she is able to mobilize
                  sorority women from every Congressional district to put the heat
                  on their representatives to sign the petition. She organizes
                  the Congressional interns. She even puts together a Million Dog
                  March. Eventually Elle addresses the House, giving an incredibly
                  sappy speech, and gets the final signatures needed to meet the
                  magic 218 number. Her boss, Congresswoman Rudd, supplies the
                  last one. The bill passes.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The parallels to <i>Mr. Smith
                  Goes to Washington</i> couldn't be clearer. (<i>Legally Blonde
                  2</i> gives a nod to <i>Mr. Smith </i>by running a brief clip
                  from the older film). Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart) goes to
                  Washington as a freshman Senator. He is a hick from the sticks,
                  the head of the state's Boy's Rangers, nominated by the hacks
                  in the state party machine to fill a sudden vacancy. The idea
                  is that he won't be smart enough to interfere with a corrupt
                  bill sponsored by the senior senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains)
                  to build the Willet Creek dam, a pork barrel project that would
                  enrich only himself and his rich cronies.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Smith is totally na&iuml;ve,
                  believing in the good faith of the famous people all around him.
                  He is ridiculed by everyone, especially the press. To keep him
                  from quitting, Paine encourages him to introduce his own bill
                  for a national boys camp. He is given critical assistance by
                  Clarissa Saunders, a cynical staffer (Jean Arthur) who helps
                  him draft it and explains the whole legislative process to him.
                  However, the camp is to be located on Willet Creek--the very
                  area that Paine's cronies have earmarked for the dam. Saunders
                  clues Smith in to what's really happening and he decides he has
                  to stop the crooked Willet Creek dam.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Now the machine wakes up to
                  the threat and realizes that it must crush Smith, but Senator
                  Paine has qualms. However, his big money backers force him to
                  do it. In a fascinating scene, Paine tries to justify the fact
                  that he's a tool of the party machine; by playing ball with the
                  machine, he's been able to get many federal grants for the state.
                  This parallels scenes in LB2 in which Congresswoman Rudd traded
                  off her support for the animal testing bill to get other, perhaps
                  more important, legislation passed.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">When persuasion doesn't work,
                  Paine mounts an all-out campaign to disgrace Smith by proving
                  (through phony documents and false testimony) that he would benefit
                  financially from the construction of the boys camp. Smith is
                  about to be expelled from the Senate. Revisiting the Lincoln
                  Memorial, he is ready to throw in the sponge and go home but
                  Saunders finds him there. In an inspiring speech, she persuades
                  him to keep fighting.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The next day, Smith manages
                  to get the floor and mounts a one-man filibuster. Nearly fainting
                  from exhaustion, he delivers the key speech that stops the bill,
                  destroys the party machine, and halts his own expulsion. Back
                  in his home state, only a single media outlet stands up for him--Boys
                  Stuff--but it is delivered everywhere by an army of faithful
                  boys, very like the mobilization of the Delta Nus in <i>LB2</i>.
                  Eventually, the crooked Senator Paine is overcome by conscience
                  and saves the day.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Corny but inspiring, no? You
                  would have to be made of stone not to be inspired by <i>Mr. Smith</i>.
                  Perhaps the same thing will be true for today's young people
                  after they take in the vastly inferior <i>LB2</i>. As in <i>Mr.
                  Smith</i>, an idealistic but utterly clueless person comes to
                  Congress and finally figures out the corruption behind the lawmaking
                  process. She takes in the inspiring sites like the Lincoln Memorial,
                  but figures out that the reality of the system is nothing like
                  the marble monuments. One person--a freshman Senator or an insignificant
                  aide--could do nothing to combat the power structure, the corrupt
                  system of campaign finance, and the seniority system. Most would
                  throw up their hands in despair and just quit or become coopted
                  by the system. Aided by knowledgeable insiders, both characters
                  find a way to turn the legislative process around (even converting
                  their key antagonists). Most important, they rely heavily on
                  the people (the boy rangers or the Delta Nus and the Million
                  Dog March). By arousing public opinion, miracles can occur, even
                  in the lavish but corrupt pits of Congress.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">These are messages I really
                  like. What happens in Congress should matter a lot to ordinary
                  people. One idealistic person in the legislature can make a difference.
                  Cynical, corrupt people can be redeemed. You can build bridges
                  to people who you mostly disagree with (as Elle does to the genial
                  Southern congressman and NRA supporter Stanford Marks). And public
                  opinion, properly mobilized, can disrupt the Congressional money
                  machine that mostly generates legislation rewarding big contributors.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">OK, these messages are sugar-coated
                  in <i>LB2</i> and there are a lot of really dumb jokes. The film
                  is going to leave most readers of this website completely cold.
                  They will be wondering why they wasted the time and the admission
                  price. They could have stayed home and watched a rented video
                  of <i>Mr. Smith</i>. But please don't forget--we're talking popular
                  culture here. Pop culture is produced exclusively to make money
                  and most of it is pretty dumb or trashy. That doesn't mean it's
                  unimportant. Young people mostly don't vote and are utterly indifferent
                  to the political process. If some of them walk out of the theater
                  with some of these very positive messages in mind, if they can
                  give the movie a personal spin and decide they need to get involved
                  in (or at least pay attention to) the legislative process, then
                  <i>LB2 </i>will have made a lasting and positive impact on our
                  culture.<br>
