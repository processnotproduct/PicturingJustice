                  by Paul Bergman</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Practice</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">, the series about the trials and tribulations
                  of a small Boston law firm, premiered for the 2001-2002 television
                  season on September 23, 2001 in a &quot;special&quot; two-hour
                  episode. In <i>The Candidate</i>, Bobby Donnell, Ellenor Frutt
                  and the rest of Donnell's law firm represented a popular Massachusetts
                  state senator charged with murdering his wife's lover.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After receiving conflicting
                  advice from the members of the firm, the senator went on television
                  and admitted to killing the man, but claimed that he was not
                  guilty of any crime because he thought that he was protecting
                  his wife's life. He had come home with his daughter from the
                  movies and heard strange noises coming from the bedroom. Thinking
                  that his wife was being attacked, he quickly got his gun and
                  ran into the bedroom to find a strange man on top of her. He
                  shot and killed the man, only to learn soon after that he had
                  caught his wife and her lover &quot;in flagrante delicto.&quot;
                  If believed by the jury, the senator's story would constitute
                  the defense of &quot;imperfect self-defense,&quot; because he
                  mistakenly but reasonably believed that he killed to protect
                  his wife's life.<br>
<br>
                  This season debut episode aired less than two weeks after suicide
                  terrorists said to be Muslim extremists hijacked four airplanes
                  on September 11, 2001, and crashed them the World Trade Center
                  in New York and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. About 6000 people
                  died, the economy fell apart and Americans were shocked and paralyzed
                  at the enormity of the crimes. Americans were looking for hope
                  and inspiration, but it was hard to find in the news in the days
                  following September 11, 2001.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the pre-television days
                  of World War II, movies offered solace and bolstered spirits
                  by offering positive images of America that would make audiences
                  feel proud and believe that what their children and friends were
                  dying for was noble and just. Some of the most important images
                  were of the American legal system. <i>The Talk of the Town</i>
                  (1942), starring Cary Grant, Ronald Colman and Jean Arthur, is
                  a prime example. Colman is Michael Lightcap, a law professor
                  who awaits his confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court by renting
                  a cabin and writing a legal treatise. Lightcap's unexpected co-tenants
                  are the cabin's owner Nora Shelley (Arthur) and Leopold Dilg
                  (Grant), a prison escapee who was wrongly convicted of arson
                  and murder. Dilg's whereabouts are eventually discovered and
                  he is brought to court. The courthouse is stormed by an angry
                  mob intent on hanging Dilg. Just in time, Lightcap rushes into
                  court with the actual murderer and fires a gun to stop the mob
                  in its tracks.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Lightcap sends the mob home
                  with a stirring speech proclaiming the value and sanctity of
                  the American legal system. He tells them that the law is what
                  makes them free people in a free country, and that the rest of
                  the world is crying out for that law. He scolds the townspeople
                  for sullying a courtroom with weaponry (apparently forgetting
                  for the moment the gun that he fired to get their attention).
                  People must live by the law's precepts every day, and fight and
                  die to preserve it for future generations.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Any Americans looking to the
                  premiere episode of <i>The Practice</i> for similar inspiration
                  about the legal system would have been sadly disappointed. Both
                  the prosecutors and the defense attorneys spend much of their
                  time hurling accusations of impropriety at each other and trying
                  to influence the jury pool by making statements to the media.
                  Ellenor Frutt, the senator's old friend and lawyer, improperly
                  advises him to take a shower to wash off any blood splatters
                  before calling the police to report the shooting. Even children
                  have no scruples about committing perjury, as the senator's teenage
                  daughter takes the stand to testify to the made-up story she
                  planned with her parents, only to tell an even more outlandish
                  one.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">According to this episode of
                  <i>The Practice</i>, nobody is interested in the truth and the
                  legal system is incapable of producing it. The judge, thinking
                  that justice has been done, is satisfied when the senator pleads
                  guilty to a lesser offense in exchange for a reduced sentence.
                  However, the episode ends with a third version of &quot;what
                  really happened,&quot; one known only to Ellenor and the family.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The legal system that Michael
                  Lightcap so proudly held up to audiences in 1942 now is portrayed
                  as just another manipulable cog in the market economy. I doubt
                  that anybody in the airplanes, the World Trade Center or the
                  Pentagon would have been willing to die for it on September 11.</font></p>
