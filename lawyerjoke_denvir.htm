            <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">My Favorite Lawyer Joke</font></b></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by John Denvir</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A wealthy man on his death
            bed called his three best friends-- his doctor, his priest, and
            his lawyer-- to make a final request. &quot;Who knows what I
            will find on the other side? Just to be sure, I am giving you
            each one hundred thousand dollars and I ask that you place an
            envelope with that amount in my casket.&quot; All three took
            the money and agreed to fulfill his wish.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">He died soon thereafter and
            at the funeral each friend slipped an envelope into the casket.
            After the burial, the three walked together from the grave. The
            doctor said, &quot;My friends, I have a confession to make; since
            the hospital was short of funds for treating the poor I only
            put 80, 000 dollars in the envelope and donated the other 20,
            000 to our indigent fund.&quot; The priest then said, &quot;I
            too have to confess that I gave 50,000 dollars to the homeless
            and only put fifty thousand in the casket.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The lawyer looked both his
            friends straight in the eye and said, &quot;I am astonished and
            deeply disappointed that you failed to keep your solemn promise
            to our dear departed friend. I want you to know that I placed
            in his coffin my personal check for the full 100, 000 dollars.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/loweringbar.jpg" width="123" height="162" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">This
            is just one of hundreds of lawyer jokes discussed in Marc Galanter's
            excellent new book &quot;<i>Lowering the Bar: Lawyer Jokes in
            Legal Culture</i>&quot; ( University of Wisconsin Press 2005).
            But it would be a mistake to describe Galanter's book as merely
            a compendium of lawyer jokes. It's an erudite study of what lawyer
            jokes can tell us about the public's unconscious feelings-positive
            and negative-- towards the legal profession. Galanter's argues
            that jokes always reflect an underlying social tension that is
            difficult to discuss directly. Therefore, jokes can instruct
            as well as amuse us.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The &quot;envelope in the casket&quot;
            story is my personal favorite in Galanter's book because I think
            it best reflects the public's ambivalence towards lawyers. First,
            let's remember that the story is in one sense is a pro-lawyer
            joke. Galanter has a whole chapter on what he calls &quot;death
            wish&quot; jokes. These are jokes where the punch line delights
            in the death of lawyers: &quot;What do you call six thousand
            lawyers at the bottom of the sea? A good start.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In contrast, central to the
            &quot;envelope in the casket&quot; joke is admiration for the
            lawyer's cleverness in avoiding an absurd result. After all,
            placing a hundred thousand dollars cash in a coffin as it enters
            the ground is a rather silly act. It's hard to envisage any good
            coming from it. Anyone hearing the joke realizes if there is
            an afterlife, it's certain beyond a reasonable doubt that it
            won't be a cash economy. So the lawyer found a clever way to
            keep his promise without wasting the money. Perhaps the doctor
            and the priest wish they had consulted counsel before throwing
            away tens of thousands of dollars. This ability to twist language
            to get the right result is why clients go to lawyers.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Yet there's no denying that
            the joke leaves us with some moral queasiness. One problem is
            that the lawyer's act is self-serving. Why is that? There is
            no mention of his donating the 100,000 dollars to the legal aid
            society. So too, he's a little self-satisfied, a bit too proud
            of his cleverness. But our largest qualm has to do with whether
            he has breached his friend's trust. In one sense he has; no one
            thinks the dying man would have given him the money if he knew
            it would be replaced with a check. Yet the lawyer did not receive
            the money in a professional relationship; he was approached as
            one of three friends, not as a lawyer. To refuse his friend's
            request on the ground that it was patently ridiculous itself
            would have been cold-hearted. He can rightly claim that he accomplished
            two worthy goals; his reassured his friend and he managed not
            to waste 100,000 dollars. That he personally benefited and is
            so pleased with himself makes him a less admirable fellow, but
            it's really irrelevant to the issue of trust. <br>
            I think the lawyer's real sin from the lay viewpoint is irreverence.
            He has violated a social taboo about honoring &quot;dying wishes.&quot;
            But to the lawyer irreverence is not a sin, but a professional
            virtue. Good lawyers always have to challenge social taboos in
            their quest to shape the world according to fact and reason.
            By so doing they de-mystify the world, showing it be the product
            of human action rather than pre-ordained order. This necessarily
            includes challenging long held social beliefs like the supposed
            sanctity of dying wishes.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But while I don't think that
            the lawyer has acted improperly, that doesn't mean he should
            expect people to like him for his success. Like the gunslinger
            in the Western movie, the lawyer is destined to be a social outsider,
            admired and feared, but seldom loved by ordinary folk. At least,
            that's my take. What do you think? Let me know at denvirj@usfca.edu.

            fine book. <br>
