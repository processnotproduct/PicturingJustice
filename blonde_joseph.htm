                  by Paul R Joseph</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I went to see <i>Legally Blonde</i>
                  as an assignment and specifically to write about it for Picturing
                  Justice. Currently, I am teaching torts to first-year law students.
                  Does this movie have any messages that I want my law students
                  to receive? Would I recommend it to them, I wondered?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Of course, I understand that
                  <i>Legally Blonde</i> is a comedy. Perhaps, in its clumsy, obvious
                  way, it aspired to parody. It isn't a documentary about the law.
                  I am just as willing to find serious and helpful legal messages
                  in an <i>Ally McBeal</i> as in a <i>Law and Order</i>. Unfortunately,
                  I didn't find any in this painful-to-watch movie.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/Legally Blonde 1.jpg" width="204" height="137" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In
                  a previous incarnation, Cyndi Lauper told us that &quot;girls
                  just want to have fun.&quot; <i>Legally Blonde</i> agrees wholeheartedly
                  while sulkily noting that if they absolutely, positively have
                  to, then and only then, a girl will be smart.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">For <i>Legally Blonde</i> to
                  have any credibility, we must accept the central premise that
                  Elle (played endearingly as always by Reese Witherspoon) is really
                  &quot;smart&quot; all along. Unfortunately, the evidence of this
                  is scant. A 4.0 average in fashion merchandising and a 143 practice
                  LSAT score do not make a strong case, but the real problem is
                  that it is not credible that anyone as intelligent as we are
                  supposed to believe Elle is would be content with the vapid,
                  meaningless life she has lived for so long.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Oh, I forgot, her LSAT score
                  was actually 179. Elle studied for a week and raised it to near-perfect
                  level. That's the other bogus message in this movie, and in so
                  much of popular culture these days, that one can slouch along
                  doing nothing and then, with a little intensive work and a lot
                  of perky attitude, succeed in anything and everything. No, this
                  is not a message that I want my students to get-if they do, they
                  are liable to do themselves irreparable harm-and to flunk out.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At one point in <i>Legally
                  Blonde</i>, Elle is told not to go to law school because law
                  school is for those who are &quot;ugly, serious and boring.&quot;
                  The movie seems to agree. The students are stuck-up and the faculty
                  is nasty (and worse). What's really offensive, however, is that
                  they all seem so-well, dumb. In this crowd, no wonder Elle can
                  rise to the top.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the real world, first-year
                  law students do not represent murder defendants. Students who
                  have never taken criminal law, evidence or trial practice are
                  simply not qualified to do it. But that doesn't stop Elle and
                  in the world of <i>Legally Blonde</i> neither legal knowledge
                  nor experience is needed, because she's &quot;smart.&quot; Even
                  once she gets &quot;serious,&quot; she doesn't study much, but
                  it's okay because she's really &quot;smart&quot; after all. Memo
                  to students-even if you are smart, without knowledge and effort
                  you are not likely to be competent.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Legally Blonde</i> tells us that a lawyer should form a bond
                  of trust with her or his client. Undoubtedly true. But that bond,
                  without an understanding of the law and without training in the
                  skills of lawyering, is unlikely to lead to a successful result.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Avoid this movie like the plague.
                  It's the &quot;smart&quot; thing to do.</font></p>
