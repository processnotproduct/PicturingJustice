                  By Mary Kilpatrick</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The HBO series <i>Deadwood</i>
                  has received critical acclaim for its deconstruction of the Western
                  genre. What sets the series apart is its fearless depiction of
                  the violence and mayhem that accompany the process of moving
                  from near anarchy to civilization. Can an ordered civilization
                  exist without law? No one in <i>Deadwood</i> wears a white hat,
                  and the series is drenched in blood, mud and foul language.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/deadwood.jpg" width="97" height="131" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In
                  1876, Deadwood literally exists outside the law. The show uses
                  the traditional Western theme of law and order coming to a place
                  outside the law and then turns it on its head. David Milch (<i>NYPD
                  Blue</i>) said that what interested him in creating the series
                  is &quot;the idea of order without law.&quot; Deadwood is a mining
                  camp located on land that, by treaty, actually belongs to the
                  Sioux nation. Due to political and economic considerations, the
                  United States government has allowed the illegal settlement to
                  exist. One of the show's main characters, saloon owner Al Swearengen,
                  is working to have Deadwood annexed into the Dakota Territory
                  throughout seasons one and two.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Al Swearengen is the ultimate
                  anti-hero, a scoundrel with a streak of compassion. He presides
                  over Deadwood using violence and intimidation, remorselessly
                  having his enemies murdered and fed to man-eating pigs. Al knows
                  exactly what he is doing when he orders a murder - he uses the
                  word &quot;murder&quot; instead of the word &quot;kill.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Al's violence brings order
                  to the camp, an order without color of law that allows Al to
                  continue to fleece the prospectors by providing them with whiskey,
                  women, and gambling. It is Al's desire to prevent unrest in the
                  camp that motivates his actions. When Al fears information about
                  white marauders preying on travelers would unsettle the miners,
                  he is even willing to go so far as to have a young girl murdered
                  to prevent her talking about the bandits who killed her family.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">While Al works to maintain
                  order in the camp to keep the gold flowing into his till, Seth
                  Bullock, Deadwood's other hero, turns to law enforcement as a
                  way to control his own violent impulses. Seth is a man who beats
                  his lover's father to a pulp and will get into an all-out brawl
                  with Al over an insult to his honor. Yet, he repeatedly turns
                  to the law to reign in his violent nature and to curb the lawless
                  violence of others.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Oliver Wendell Holmes said
                  that the law develops out of society's need to minimize the collateral
                  consequences of the taking of revenge, and Seth's relationship
                  with law fits this model. In <i>Deadwood</i>'s first episode,
                  Seth is a Marshal in Montana and is confronted by a lynch mob
                  wanting to hang the horse thief in his custody. Sampson, the
                  man whose horse the thief stole, demands that he be allowed to
                  kill the prisoner himself. However, Sampson's desire for personal
                  retribution is thwarted by Seth, who insists that the prisoner
                  will hang &quot;under color of law.&quot; Rather than allowing
                  the mob to kill the prisoner, Seth hangs him from a rafter on
                  the porch.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Later in season one, Seth turns
                  to the law to govern his own desire for revenge. Bullock's friend
                  Wild Bill Hickok is shot in the back by Jack McCall. When McCall
                  is acquitted in a sham trial and leaves camp, Seth takes off
                  after him intending to exact revenge. A Sioux warrior ambushes
                  him on the trail, and Seth kills the warrior, though he himself
                  is badly injured. Seth's violent encounter with the Sioux warrior
                  causes him to change his mind about his desire for revenge, and
                  after apprehending McCall, Seth delivers him to Yankton for a
                  new trial.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Seth eventually takes on the
                  role of Deadwood's sheriff, despite his own misgivings. Even
                  this transformation occurs out of an act of violence. When Seth
                  sees Deadwood's current sheriff inciting violence as a result
                  of a bribe, Seth punches him out and throws his sheriff's star
                  into the mud. Seth then literally picks up the sheriff's star
                  out of the mud and wipes it clean before pinning it on his own
                  vest. Despite his own frequent recourse to violence, Seth cannot
                  stand to see the law sullied by corruption or mud.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Over the course of the first
                  two seasons, Deadwood begins to take on the trappings of civilization.
                  In the first season, Al learns that the government in Yankton
                  will look more favorably on Deadwood (and preserve the claims
                  of existing stakeholders) if the settlement has some sort of
                  rudimentary organization in place. He calls a meeting of the
                  main players in the settlement to elect a mayor and some other
                  officers, and his minion, Johnny, serves peaches. From this point
                  forward, peaches are served at each meeting of the new town government.
                  This is how great government traditions begin.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Season two ends with Al signing
                  the camp over to the government in Yankton, making it part of
                  the Dakota Territory. As season three begins in 2006, Deadwood
                  will be transformed from a place with &quot;no law at all&quot;
                  to a legally-sanctioned town - and it will be fascinating to
                  see what happens when law comes to Deadwood.<br>
