                  by Christine Alice Corcos</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kevin Hill </font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">is a much better show than its advertising
                  campaign last fall suggested, and rapidly becoming as good a
                  show as it can be. The commercials emphasized Kevin (Taye Diggs)'s
                  sex appeal, his love life and his charisma, and how all of that
                  would cause problems for him when he meets up with a one year
                  child-his dead cousin's daughter, Sarah, who becomes his ward
                  in the first episode. Instant conflict! What will Kevin do when
                  he has to decide between going out on a date with an attractive
                  woman and staying in with little Sarah who has the sniffles?
                  What a dilemma! <br>
<br>
                  It <i>is</i> a dilemma for a young professional in his late 20s,
                  used to putting his own desires first and not quite ready to
                  settle down. The girlfriends who drift in and out of Kevin's
                  life and the clients who pay his fees have tried and failed to
                  make him see what Sarah communicates to him in about forty-eight
                  hours-that sometimes other people come first. In fact, Sarah's
                  crying for her lost daddy and the fact that Kevin can't find
                  a sitter keeps this self-absorbed young attorney up so that he
                  can't prepare for his cases. His senior partner tells him to
                  choose between his position at the firm and the baby. Out of
                  loyalty to his cousin, Kevin ultimately chooses Sarah. In the
                  first episode, he's back on the street fairly quickly, looking
                  for a position that will allow him to care for Sarah as well
                  as pursue his legal career. The show thus presents us with a
                  male character who has to face several problems usually reserved
                  for women with children: looking for jobs that allow them to
                  spend time with their children for at least part of the day and
                  looking for jobs that will pay for child care that covers the
                  rest of the day. It's not an easy task, as Kevin finds out fairly
                  quickly. He tries various firms throughout the city, and each
                  rejects him, worried that the strain of caring for Sarah will
                  distract him. They've also heard that he has mishandled a couple
                  of cases since Sarah arrived, so their concerns are justified.<br>
<br>
                  Luckily for our hero he's an honors graduate of a prestigious
                  New York area law school, and he's male (though African-American).
                  He stumbles on a law firm (Grey and Associates) founded and run
                  by a woman (Michael Michele) who faces the very same problem.
                  She tells Kevin she wanted to set up a firm that would allow
                  women attorneys to practice law on their terms, at their pace,
                  at their own time, and with time off if they needed it to see
                  to their children. What a break! But Kevin's not convinced. After
                  all, he was once an associate at a big-time law firm. He's not
                  certain he wants to throw in his lot with a bunch of women at
                  a store front practice, even if they are pretty good lawyers.
                  In addition, he's had a brief affair with one of them (Kate Levering),
                  and he's not certain that he could handle seeing her every day.
                  Viewers please note: almost every week Kevin will run into women
                  with whom he's had, well, how can I put this delicately-dalliances.
                  At this point, we are entitled to think, and I do think, that
                  in the past Kevin has been quite a piece of work. Has he always
                  walked away from women after bedding them? What effect will having
                  custody of a young girl have on this pattern of behavior? <br>
<br>
                  Since the offer from Grey and Associates is the only one he gets,
                  Kevin decides to take it. The other women in the firm are less
                  enthusiastic than the founding partner, however, but Kevin turns
                  on the charm. His aggressive style is not what they are used
                  to however, and many of the episodes emphasize clashes, either
                  in court or in the office, during which the attorneys argue over
                  how to handle clients or who should handle trial strategy. In
                  one episode, &quot;Making the Grade,&quot; Kevin and Nicolette,
                  the fourth attorney in the practice, take on the defense of a
                  man who runs a dating service and who is accused of fraud by
                  a client who did not find his &quot;perfect match.&quot; Nicolette
                  clearly does not like the client or his services and has difficulty
                  creating an adequate defense; Kevin simply forges ahead. But
                  he alienates the jury with his characterization of the plaintiff
                  as a pathetic whiner to such an extent that Nicolette must take
                  over the case. In another episode he realizes the limitations
                  of the law when he realizes both that his mentor from law school
                  is guilty of sexual harassment and that he will not be able to
                  bring the man to justice. Several episodes demonstrate Kevin's
                  inability to tone down his approach and his need to learn to
                  be a real &quot;team player&quot; (as opposed to the kind of
                  &quot;team playing&quot; that some men mean when they use the
                  term). In the law firm Kevin has now joined, &quot;team playing&quot;
                  means listening to what other people say, and hearing them. It
                  does not mean preparing what you are going to say while waiting
                  for them to stop talking. Kevin's evolution from a cocky know
                  it all to a more mature adult, is heartening to watch.<br>
<br>
                  Similarly, Kevin's relationships progress from one-night stands
                  with pretty women who leave him because he simply won't call
                  to friendships, if not actual commitments. When Sarah's nanny
                  George tells a woman in whom Kevin is genuinely interested that
                  he isn't the type to get serious, Kevin is furious, not solely
                  because it isn't as true now as it has been in the past as because
                  he realizes that he has no right to expect that George trust
                  him in this matter. Just because he is trying very hard to make
                  certain that in this particular case a real relationship develops
                  does not mean that he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.
                  Kevin, like Sarah, is growing, and so is this show. Past actions
                  have present consequences, not just for Kevin's clients, but
                  for him.<br>
<br>
                  The legal issues presented in <i>Kevin Hill</i> test boundaries.
                  In some cases they are reminiscent of <i>Ally McBeal</i>. In
                  &quot;Homework,&quot; a woman sues her daughter for mishandling
                  a trust fund because the young woman is getting investment advice
                  from her dead father via a psychic. In others they are truly
                  well thought out and quite provocative. The writers do a creditable
                  job of explaining complex legal theories to the lay public. In
                  &quot;Snack Daddy,&quot; a client wants to sue her employer for
                  sex discrimination because she has been terminated from her position
                  as a sales representative. The employer claims she hasn't been
                  performing well and clients have complained. The evidence seems
                  to support the employer's position until Kevin and his colleagues
                  investigate by asking the clients. What is incredible in the
                  story, however, is that they seem to wait until the last minute.
                  The client is ready to sign a paltry settlement; Kevin rushes
                  in shouting, &quot;Wait! Don't sign!&quot; having discovered
                  that &quot;someone&quot; (the client's fianc&eacute;) concocted
                  a story about the client not performing well as a sales rep.
                  This creep's explanation is that one of the two of them would
                  have had to leave the company once they were married-why is not
                  evident. His career was more solid than hers, and he would have
                  supported her anyway. The writers use the &quot;surprise ending&quot;
                  to augment our appreciation of Kevin's skill as a lawyer. In
                  truth, he looks less competent. Competent lawyers would have
                  interviewed the clients to find out what they thought of the
                  woman, and would have tumbled to the discrepancies in the employer's
                  story much sooner than do Kevin and his colleagues. The writers
                  could still have made a surprise ending out of confronting the
                  fianc&eacute; and surprising the client in a meeting. It didn't
                  have to be at the last minute, precisely when she was signing
                  the settlement agreement and waiving her rights. In the same
                  episode we see Kevin begin a relationship with a single mother
                  he meets at Sarah's day care. He likes her, but not enough to
                  continue seeing her when he discovers that she wants to continue
                  seeing him, even though the only thing that he can point to that
                  makes him uncomfortable is precisely that (see comments above).
<br>
<br>
                  <i>Kevin Hill </i>is on my list of favorite television lawyer
                  shows for this season. I rarely miss it, because I truly like
                  the acting-it's fresh and vigorous. I particularly admire Patrick
                  Breen as the caring nanny George, who hands out tough love and
                  dating tips with equal fervor. The female attorneys have plenty
                  to do, and they do it with competence. Sarah is a refreshingly
                  real little girl, not an overly cute Hollywood creation. And
                  Taye Diggs as Kevin shows both masculinity and emotion. He is
                  an accomplished actor with presence and style. In the Popular
                  Culture Defense Bar Association (PCDBA) Kevin Hill should run
                  for President.<br>
