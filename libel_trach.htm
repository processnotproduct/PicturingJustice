                  by Lisa Trach</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">How often do we hear phrases
                  like, &quot;<i>He got a slap on the wrist</i>&quot;, or &quot;<i>He
                  got off on a technicality</i>&quot;? How about jokes that start
                  off something like, &quot;<i>A doctor, an accountant, and a lawyer
                  walk into a bar&#133;</i>&quot; where the punch line is about
                  the lawyer being dishonest, greedy, or disliked? It seems that
                  the current attitude of society is that the justice system is
                  really not that just, and the members of the legal community
                  are a questionable bunch. No system is perfect, and it is probably
                  fair to say that every member of the legal community can critique
                  some aspect of our justice system. These criticisms are based
                  on experience and knowledge that comes with being involved with
                  the system. However, on what is the average citizen basing his
                  or her opinions on how just our legal system is? The average
                  citizen has little or no contact with the justice system. Their
                  main source of information about how the legal system works and
                  what kind of people run the system comes from the media, movies,
                  T.V. programs, and other popular culture. It seems inevitable
                  that what they see will influence their attitudes about the system
                  and those involved in it. Is what they are seeing correct? Or
                  does popular culture bias the average citizen, leaving them with
                  unrealistic views of how our justice system functions? To answer
                  this, it is helpful to take a look at some of the popular culture
                  of the past and present, examine how it portrays the law and
                  lawyers, and attempt to evaluate its accuracy. Only then does
                  it become apparent how society's negative attitudes towards the
                  justice system can be attributed, at least in part, to popular
                  culture, and how those attitudes are unfair to a legal system
                  that is inaccurately portrayed. <br>
<br>
                  One medium through which the legal system is portrayed is film.
                  Many movies embrace the law as their subject matter. A common
                  character is the lawyer. The stereotypical movie lawyer is untruthful,
                  uncaring, driven by greed, and in some cases, the villain. Recall
                  the main character in <i>Liar Liar</i> for example. His ability
                  to be a great lawyer is jeopardized when he loses his ability
                  to lie. The courtroom scene where he defends a cheating wife
                  in her divorce proceedings is a complete disaster because he
                  can not lie and his entire defense is based on lies. Jim Carey's
                  character in <i>Liar Liar</i> is also disliked outside of his
                  law office. He is divorced and neglects his duties as a father.
                  What is the message here? Lawyers are liars, and bad people.
                  We see this theme reoccurring again and again. In the most recent
                  version of <i>Cape Fear</i>, the main character, Sam Bowden,
                  is a lawyer. He is supposed to be the protagonist, but it is
                  difficult to really like him. After all, he cheated on his wife
                  and caused her to have a nervous breakdown. He also acted unethically
                  in defending a past client by not doing everything possible in
                  his defense. Then we have <i>The Devil's Advocate</i>. In this
                  film the successful head partner of a prestigious law firm turns
                  out to be the devil. Need more be said? How about Michelle Pfeiffer's
                  character, Rita, in <i>I Am Sam</i>? When she is a lawyer with
                  a successful practice, she neglects her son, is rude, won't do
                  any pro bono lawyering, makes her secretary cry, and avoids her
                  husband. Later in the film, when she announces that she has essentially
                  given up her busy practice, she is portrayed as the caring friend,
                  great mother, and all-around nice gal. How does a lawyer get
                  to be a nice person? According to the movies, they have to quit
                  being a lawyer. <br>
<br>
                  A closer look at lawyers exposes the common movie depiction as
                  false. Law students are taught the ethics of their trade from
                  the very beginning of their career and making only those representations
                  that are known to be true is one of the most important of those
                  ethical obligations. The legal community is a relatively small
                  one. Therefore, the actions of each lawyer are constantly scrutinized
                  by their peers. One's reputation within the legal community is
                  easily tarnished by deceitfulness. A lawyer can quickly lose
                  the respect of other members of the legal community by misleading.
                  Do some lawyers lie? The answer is most likely, &quot;<i>Yes</i>&quot;.
                  Nevertheless, making the generalization that all lawyers are
                  liars is unrealistic. The legal profession is one that demands
                  integrity, and most lawyers take that very seriously. The idea
                  that lawyers are driven by greed, and that successful lawyers
                  don't do pro bono or charity work is also false. Some examples
                  serve to defeat this assumption. In British Columbia, the Salvation
                  Army runs a Pro Bono program that provides free legal services
                  to those who do not qualify for legal aid. In 1999, nearly 170
                  lawyers donated their time and services to this program. Similarly,
                  one of the most successful and respected criminal lawyers in
                  Edmonton, Alberta, was recently ranked third on the list of lawyers
                  who do the most legal aid work in Alberta. Clearly this is not
                  motivated by greed, as legal aid is not as lucrative as regular
                  practice. Even during the most demanding times in their career,
                  lawyers find time to donate their services. Crossroads, a program
                  in Edmonton, Alberta that sends outreach workers into the inner
                  city, benefits from the volunteered time of a young associate.
                  This young lawyer joins the outreach worker in the Crossroads
                  van, traveling the streets during late night shifts, encouraging
                  safety and providing legal information to Edmonton's prostitution
                  community. She did so throughout her busy articling year and
                  continues to be a volunteer with the organization. Is this work
                  of people who can be equated with the devil? The depiction of
                  lawyers in the movies leads the public to see the entire community
                  as having little compassion and no character. However, these
                  lawyers, among many others prove that this portrayal is unfair,
                  leaving lawyers to battle a stereotype that in many cases is
                  totally inaccurate. <br>
<br>
                  It is not just the portrayal of the lawyer in movies that is
                  disturbing. Movies often depict the entire legal system as unfair
                  and corrupt. For example, in <i>I Am Sam</i>, the viewer is put
                  into Sam's shoes and takes his side. Sam is shown as a loving
                  father that has his child taken away from him because he is mentally
                  challenged. To the viewer, the legal system seems cruel because
                  it takes Lucy from Sam, even though he has raised her for 7 years
                  and she is very bright and well adjusted. The district attorney,
                  judge, and social worker, all working on behalf of the legal
                  system, are portrayed as heartless, wanting to take her away
                  from her true father without really caring about what Lucy wants.
                  The viewer is outraged at the system for taking a young girl
                  away from her father when he clearly loves her dearly. Who cares
                  if he is disabled? After all, as Lucy says, &quot;<i>All you
                  need is love</i>&quot;. <br>
<br>
                  A realistic look at the situation reveals that the movie's version
                  of the legal system is deceiving and unduly harsh. It is not
                  cruel that our system inquires into the ability of a severely
                  disabled parent to care for a child. In fact, it seems that a
                  system that did not make this inquiry would be negligent in caring
                  for the youth of its jurisdiction. Lucy's comment about only
                  needing love is very sweet, but oversimplifies things enormously.
                  A report done by the New York State Commission of Quality of
                  Care outlined some of the problems facing parents with mental
                  disabilities. The study profiled 41 families in detail. &quot;<i>In
                  general, it was found intellectually challenged parents had low
                  self esteem; they resisted help from the outside for fear of
                  losing their children; almost half of the parents in the study
                  had faced at least one allegation of child abuse or neglect.
                  Twenty-five percent of the children failed to receive adequate
                  medical, dental care and nutrition. And nearly two thirds of
                  the children over the age of three had an identified learning
                  disability, believed to be as a result of not getting enough
                  stimulation in their early formative years</i>.&quot;(<a href="#1">1</a>)
                  This does not necessarily mean that a disabled parent can not
                  be a good parent. This study simply indicates that it is fair
                  that our legal system look into a mentally challenged parent's
                  abilities to insure the child is getting the necessary care.
                  The system must put the best interest of the child in front of
                  any other factor. This is just one example of how movies can
                  distort the goals of the legal system and deceive the general
                  public. A depiction such as the one in <i>I Am Sam</i> that ridicules
                  the legal system and is effective in persuading the viewer that
                  the system is unjust for making such an inquiry is ludicrous.
                  Yet these types of depictions occur in movies quite frequently.
<br>
<br>
                  Movies are not the only form of popular culture that influences
                  the beliefs of people about the legal system and community. Television
                  is perhaps even more invasive and persuasive to the general public.
                  Shows such as <i>Law and Order</i>, <i>The Practice</i>, and
                  <i>Matlock</i> definitely have an influence on how the public
                  imagines the justice system to be. However, their accuracy leaves
                  much to be desired. Although they may deal with issues that are
                  current in the real-life legal community, they do so in a way
                  that biases the viewer. For example, <i>Law and Order</i> shows
                  each of its cases from the point of view of the police and the
                  prosecution. Defense counsel is made to look like the villain,
                  siding with the guilty and trying anything to get them off. Meanwhile,
                  the prosecutors are made out to be heroes, who usually are seeking
                  a result that popular opinion at the time would support. This
                  leaves the viewer with the impression that the legal system is
                  a battle between the &quot;good guys&quot; and the &quot;bad
                  guys&quot; where the only just result is when the &quot;good
                  guys&quot; prevail. These television programs also fail to represent
                  the workings of the system accurately. In Matlock, we always
                  see Ben get up and lay out the &quot;truth&quot; in front of
                  the jury while he is supposed to be cross-examining the witness.
                  This type of monologue would never happen in a courtroom during
                  a cross examination. The rules of evidence forbid it. Sadly,
                  the public is influenced by this type of programming and will
                  often refer to things seen on these shows when discussing their
                  attitudes towards the justice system. <br>
<br>
                  Perhaps the most frightening medium through which people's attitudes
                  about the justice system are prejudiced is the media. This is
                  because people consider the media to be based on fact, whereas
                  they know there is some element of fiction to television and
                  movies. However, the media can also paint misleading pictures
                  of justice and the system. Even the wording of a newspaper headline
                  can bias the public, causing them to expect a certain result
                  and become dissatisfied with the system when their expectations
                  are not met. Take, for example, headlines such as &quot;<i>Biggest
                  Reward for Slayer</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>Boy Must Face Higher
                  Court in Slaying</i>&quot;. The fact that the words &quot;slayer&quot;
                  and &quot;slaying&quot; are used invokes public emotion. The
                  articles following these headlines paint a very one-sided picture,
                  and could easily convince the public of the boy's involvement
                  in the crime. If the boy were not convicted, the public may react.
                  Even more devastating is the reality of what happened in the
                  case described in these headlines. Biased views as to his guilt
                  caused this boy, at only age 14, to be convicted of murder of
                  a young girl and initially sentenced to death. This young boy's
                  name was Steven Truscott. His death sentence was commuted and
                  he ended up serving ten years in jail before he was paroled.
                  He then spent thirty years living under a new identity, until
                  his story resurfaced. It is now believed that Steven was wrongfully
                  convicted. This is only one of many cases where the public has
                  believed a person to be guilty and called out to the justice
                  system to convict, later learning that the person was innocent.
                  Still, with several cases where DNA evidence has identified wrongfully
                  convicted individuals, the public continues to think that the
                  system is too kind. Many seem happier with a wrongful conviction
                  than an acquittal, although the latter means that the learned
                  members of the legal community could not be sure of guilt. Media
                  coverage skewing the facts can make the system look overly lenient
                  instead of vitally cautious. <br>
<br>
                  There may be motives as to why the legal system is portrayed
                  as it is in popular culture. Regarding the media, the motive
                  is obvious. Who wants to read about the fifty guilty pleas that
                  occurred in courtroom #268 today? On the other hand, a sensationalized
                  article on the murder and rape of a young girl by a young boy
                  draws attention. In a way, movies and television have the same
                  goal. In his article, <i>Peace Between the Sexes: Law and Gender
                  in Kramer vs. Kramer</i>, David Papke suggests another motive
                  of popular culture's portrayal of the law. He concedes that television
                  and movies are filled with legal inaccuracies, but claims that
                  they &quot;<i>are not mistakes, much less attempts to dupe the
                  lay public</i>.&quot;(<a href="#2">2</a>) Papke makes the argument
                  that the law is often an appropriate forum to play out an issue
                  that is culturally relevant at the time. In <i>Kramer vs. Kramer,</i>
                  this issue is gender inequality. Although, as Papke points out,
                  the courts no longer relied on gender to decide custody battles,
                  gender was still a topic on the minds of the public in the 1980's,
                  when the movie was released. Using it in such an inaccurate way
                  in <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i> just makes obvious the irrelevance
                  of gender to so many issues traditionally based on gender. Although
                  Papke's theory makes sense, what he seems to avoid is the fact
                  that the public may be getting duped, despite the intentions
                  of producers, screenwriters, and journalists. Although popular
                  culture may have motives other than destroying the public's confidence
                  in the justice system, it often is doing just that. <br>
<br>
                  In his book <i>Getting Away With Murder: The Canadian Criminal
                  Justice System</i>, David Paciocco seems to suggest that the
                  lack of confidence in the justice system is due to the fact that
                  the public is uninformed. He states, on pages 11-12, &quot;<i>We
                  would go a long way towards restoring the credibility of the
                  administration justice if only we would seek to explain the system
                  to the general public.</i>&quot; Not only are the public uninformed.
                  They are also misinformed. Popular culture gives the public an
                  unrealistic view of how the legal system works. It portrays the
                  person who gets off on a technicality, but fails to mention the
                  other hundred people who pleaded guilty, which is a very common
                  occurrence in our courts today. Television, movies, and the media
                  often cause the system to seem cold and unfair. However, our
                  justice system is one that protects the rights of all members
                  of society. The &quot;technicalities&quot; in popular culture
                  are, in reality safeguards against state power. When one takes
                  an informed look at the way popular culture characterizes the
                  justice system, it becomes evident that there are misrepresentations
                  and inaccuracies that lead to bias. Therefore, although entertaining,
                  information about the justice system in popular culture should
                  be accepted with skepticism, and judgments upon the system and
                  the legal community should be left to the truly informed citizen.
