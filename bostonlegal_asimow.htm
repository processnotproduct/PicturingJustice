                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It's not quite the best of
                  times or the worst of times for fans of courtroom drama on TV.
                  Of the two new lawyer series this season, <i>Boston Legal</i>
                  and <i>Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury</i>, one's pretty bad but
                  one's pretty good.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/bostonlegal 2.jpg" width="158" height="106" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Personally,
                  I dislike <i>Boston Legal</i>. After watching the initial episode
                  last fall, I didn't see another until our intrepid chief webitor
                  <a href="bostonlegal_denvir.htm">John Denvir</a> asked me to
                  take another look. So I watched four episodes but I don't plan
                  to see any more. Now, I really respect series creator and writer
                  David E. Kelley. I almost always enjoyed <i>The Practice</i>
                  which morphed into <i>Boston Legal</i>. In addition, there are
                  some really skilled actors working on this show. Finally, my
                  esteemed brother in the law and film movement <a href="bostonlegal_papke.htm">David
                  Papke</a> thinks the show is a brilliant satire. For these reasons,
                  I want to give <i>Boston Legal</i> the benefit of the doubt.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">And there are some good things
                  about <i>Boston Legal</i>. First, each of the four recent episodes
                  involved two legal cases handled by the law firm and most of
                  them were pretty interesting. For example, the lawyers confronted

                  </table></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">These interesting and meaty
                  legal issues distinguish <i>Boston Legal</i> from Kelley's previous
                  show, <i>Ally McBeal</i>. On <i>Ally</i>, the legal issues presented
                  were silly and just an excuse for keeping the lawyers busy doing
                  something while they worked out their romantic problems. Even
                  better, we see the lawyers on both sides of the <i>Boston Legal</i>
                  cases making solid legal arguments before judges and juries who
                  take them seriously.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So what's not to like? Well,
                  two things. First, I can't stand the characters. They really
                  grate on me. I think a successful television series must feature
                  at least some human beings that the audience finds empathetic.
                  On <i>The Practice</i> we cared about the characters in the law
                  firm, particularly Eugene Young, Elinor Frutt, James Berluti,
                  and Rebecca Washington. (I wasn't a fan of Bobby Donnell however)
                  We liked them as human beings and we liked the way they represented
                  their clients and struggled with the business and ethical dilemmas
                  of making a living as a bottom-feeder law firm. The same was
                  true of many of the characters on <i>LA Law</i>, which Kelley
                  produced during its middle years.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">You don't get that in <i>Boston
                  Legal</i>-not at all. Take Alan Shore (played by James Spader).
                  Shore is arrogant, obnoxious and unpleasant. He mouths off to
                  everybody including the other lawyers and the judges. I guess
                  Kelley is trying to write a show with &quot;attitude&quot; or
                  &quot;edge,&quot; and maybe you've got to do that to appeal to
                  the target demographic, but I don't like it. Maybe it's an attempt
                  to capture the nasty element in <i>Judge Judy</i> that viewers
                  seem to enjoy so much. The humor in Shore's character wore off
                  long ago.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Even worse is Denny Crane (William
                  Shatner). This one-joke character takes extreme pride in saying
                  his own name. That joke was cute when they did it on the last
                  episodes of <i>The Practice</i>, but why is it still funny after
                  being repeated over and over again? Crane thinks he's still the
                  world's greatest trial lawyer, but he seems to be suffering from
                  some sort of serious mental disintegration, so that the other
                  lawyers have to constantly shut him up. Like Shore, Crane's obnoxious,
                  just about all the time. I don't like these characters, I don't
                  find them funny, and I don't choose to invite them into my family
                  room any more.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The second thing I dislike
                  about <i>Boston Legal</i> is the stupid sexual banter that occurs
                  throughout each episode and often involves Shirley Schmidt (Candace
                  Bergen), a bottom-line oriented senior partner. Now I realize
                  that there's lots of sex going on in law firms (since the people
                  who work there have no time for any life outside the firm), and
                  sex can be a very funny subject when handled in a sophisticated
                  manner. But the sexual dialogue in <i>Boston Legal</i> is anything
                  but sophisticated. <br>

                      <td width="100%">
                        <ul>
                          <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Examples of this scintillating
                          dialogue: Shore, when introduced to a new associate who says
                          we haven't officially met: &quot;I've peeked at you in the girl's
                          room, unofficially.&quot;</font>
                          <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After winning a case, Crane
                          suggests to Schmidt that they celebrate by having sex. Schmidt:
                          &quot;It's a long time since you've hit my button, I doubt you'd
                          know where to find it.&quot;</font>
                          <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Crane to his alienated son
                          and adversary: &quot;I love you-it's hard for me to say that
                          except in foreplay.&quot;</font>
                          <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Shore to Schmidt who wants
                          him to do a closing argument: &quot;If you so enjoy keeping me
                          in the dark, you really should give me a try...in the dark. Is
                          that what this is all about-your unconscious desire to bed me?</font>
                          <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Schmidt: &quot;Come again?&quot;
                          &quot;Crane: I don't like it when you say that, Shirley, it puts
                          pressure on me.&quot; </font>&nbsp;
                        </li></li></li></li></li></ul>
                      </td>
                    </tr>
                  </table></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Well, yuk, yuk. Do you find
                  this stuff funny or just sophomoric? Perhaps the inane sexual
                  banter is considered necessary to appeal to the target demographic,
                  and perhaps it's considered cutting edge writing, but to me it's
                  annoying.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Now to <i>Law &amp; Order:
                  Trial by Jury</i>. This new Dick Wolf spinoff focuses much more
                  heavily on the criminal trial process (and much less on the police)
                  than does the original <i>Law &amp; Order</i>. It stars a terrific
                  actor, Bebe Neuwirth, as the chief prosecutor (Arthur Branch,
                  the DA on both shows, is played by Fred Dalton Thompson who I
                  find grievously miscast). These shows involve really interesting
                  criminal trials and often take us into the jury room before we
                  learn the outcome. The writing is crisp and accurate and, like
                  <i>Law &amp; Order</i>, it's all plot-driven, not character-driven.
                  One show featured an interesting vigilante killing of an accused
                  child molester, for example. Another involved the trial of a
                  cop-killer who had taken 41 bullets from the police. Another
                  involved three young men all involved somehow in a killing and
                  all trying to make their own deals. There's next to nothing about
                  the personal lives of the lawyers and that's fine with me. So,
                  from my point of view, this show is vastly superior to <i>Boston
                  Legal</i> and really is enjoyable and stimulating to watch.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Yet there's one thing about
                  <i>Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury</i> that I don't like: the
                  scummy way the defense lawyers are portrayed. The show seems
                  to be about the prosecutors' view of what defense lawyers are
                  really like. One lawyer puts on knowingly perjured testimony.
                  Another turns out to have actually driven the getaway car during
                  the murder and is handling the case (and selling out her client)
                  just to promote her political career. A third arranges a phony
                  marriage to improve his client's media image (he promises the
                  &quot;wife&quot; a good cut of the damages he plans to recover
                  from the city when he sues it for civil rights violations).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Now the original <i>Law &amp;
                  Order</i> often features irritating defense lawyers who are always
                  handing the prosecutors motions to suppress or dismiss or asserting
                  privilege and otherwise obstructing the course of justice, but
                  they're just doing their job. On <i>Trial by Jury</i>, it's quite
                  different: there seems to be a truly malevolent view about the
                  character of defense lawyers. Dick Wolf knows better than that.
                  A good TV show shouldn't just feed the public's prejudice against
                  lawyers who are doing an difficult and unpopular but very necessary
                  job.<i> <br>
