                  In one of the Picturing Justice <a href="blonde_papke.htm">articles</a>,
                  author David Papke, a law professor, submits a conversation with
                  his teenage daughter about the first <i>Legally Blonde</i> film.
                  Essentially, the conversation argues whether or not the film
                  actually has anything to do with law. It appears that the daughter
                  wins and <i>Legally Blonde</i> is really just a cute chick flick,
                  but I think that it is impossible that the meaning of the movie
                  stops there. Certainly the film gives a poor showing of legal
                  realities but there is substance there. Whenever a text engages
                  conceptions and depictions of society ideological assumptions
                  emerge from the discussion either advertently or inadvertently.
                  More commonly, ideology appears in the text inadvertently but
                  its presence is inevitable in popular culture since ideology
                  encompasses dominant world-views. An analysis of popular culture
                  then becomes incredibly revealing of a culture, and specifically,
                  of our North American culture in how we see the world and ourselves.
                  <i>My Cousin Vinny</i> is another lawyer comedy that, while seemingly
                  merely funny and easy to watch, is also indicative of popular
                  ideology. Like <i>Legally Blonde</i>, <i>My Cousin Vinny</i>'s
                  humour centers around a &quot;fish out of water&quot; story where
                  characters from one well known social locale are displaced into
                  a foreign, and equally known locale. Both films use cultural
                  stereotypes blatantly to expose some of our ideological assumptions
                  about these cultures and stock characters and to present their
                  own messages. What these films have to say about women and law
                  is telling of social ideologies and dominant views.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/mycousinvinny.jpg" width="150" height="214" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><i>My Cousin Vinny</i>
                  presents us with cultural stereotypes of North and South that
                  are inevitably exposed as erroneous ideological assumptions.
                  When Stan and his friend drive into Alabama, the scene is set
                  in an entirely rural community where manure is for sale on the
                  side of the road and where farmers chew on wheat out of the sides
                  of their mouths. The two soon-to-be accuseds for murder reveal
                  in their nervousness the stereotypes about Southern justice and
                  inbreeding that the North has of the South. The very formalistic
                  rules of court and the extensive training of Judge Haller at
                  Yale University contrast these Northern expectations of Southern
                  justice and undermine the audience's same expectations of the
                  South. Similarly, the well briefed eye-witness testimonies in
                  the preliminary inquiry reveal a polished and well researched
                  prosecutorial team. It is still a place where everyone eats grits,
                  but it is also a place where murder trials are prosecuted with
                  an incredible amount of professionalism and thoroughness. <br>
<br>
                  Similarly, the film reveals stereotypes about Italian-American
                  Northerners through Mona Lisa Vito and Vinny. When they pull
                  up in their enormous car and step outside in gaudy apparel, the
                  audience is at once expectant of the cultural clash that will
                  ensue and knows, even before they begin speaking, that these
                  are characters with little education, Brooklyn accents, terrible
                  swearing, domestic disputes, and limited knowledge of the country.
                  Lisa and Vinny seem to be stock characters, characters who have
                  a wide understanding of American-Chinese food but have never
                  heard of grits or mud ruining the alignment of car wheels. In
                  the end, both are shown to be incredibly intelligent, intuitive
                  people and the stereotype is turned on its head.<br>
<br>
                  This is particularly true of Lisa who inevitably steals the show.
                  Her image of the Italian-American bimbo and then subsequent brilliance
                  exposes assumptions about &quot;the bimbo&quot; and presents
                  us with a new ideological view of the female Italian-American,
                  that of the brilliant and empowered woman beneath the ditsy fa&ccedil;ade.
                  Lisa is an out of work hair dresser who wears stilettos, sequins,
                  has huge hair, and worries about the domesticity of her future
                  married life and ticking clock. This is an image of a cultural
                  woman that is common to us and we know what to expect from the
                  stereotype: cattiness, and superficiality combined with limited
                  literary ability. However, Lisa is not what we expect. When Vinny
                  cannot get through the first few pages of the book on rules of
                  procedure over a number of days, Lisa sits down with the book
                  and nears the middle almost immediately. Similarly, she plays
                  pool better than the sharks in the tavern, really does know more
                  about cars and torque than anyone else in the world, and calls
                  the shots in the courtroom as well as the bedroom. <br>
<br>
                  We initially see Lisa as an extension of Vinny's otherness in
                  the South and do not expect much narrative force from this type
                  of character. However, Mona Lisa Vito steps outside the stereotype
                  and reveals a new ideology of the cultural Woman, one who commands
                  attention and respect. Her brilliance is revealed to us slowly,
                  and culminates in a dazzling display in the courtroom where the
                  audience understands that she single handedly solves the entire
                  case by taking pictures of the tire tracks and then identifying
                  the perpetrators' car to be one different from the accuseds'.
                  She out performs, out speaks, and dismisses the testimonies and
                  authority of the entire male prosecutorial team (McDonald Carolan,
                  at 157). <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/legallyblonde.jpg" width="150" height="212" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><i>Legally Blonde</i>
                  attempts the same kinds of inversion with ideological assumptions
                  about place and stock characters, but is not as successful at
                  displacing old ideologies with new ideologies about place and
                  women as is <i>My Cousin Vinny</i>. Elle's arrival at Harvard,
                  the quintessential legal institution, is illustrative of popular
                  culture's assumptions about law school, and, in particular, Harvard.
                  In a small group discussion on the first day, we meet three very
                  typical law students: the absolute geek with numerous doctorates
                  who has been de-worming orphans in eastern Europe for the past
                  few months, the scary lesbian with a phD in women's studies and
                  a focus on the history of combat, and the arrogant but inept
                  genius who enjoys telling people his IQ and assumes that famous
                  philosophers take their ideas from his fourth grade papers. Elle
                  contrasts these bleak stock characters with her own stock character
                  and brilliantly coloured clothing against the grey that surrounds
                  her. She introduces herself and her dog by their astrological
                  signs and is universally rejected by this group because she is
                  not the typical law student. Later we meet Vivian Kensington,
                  the competitive and ruthless bitch. With her, the stereotypes
                  of law students are complete: no one who is dynamic, interesting,
                  or welcoming can be found at law school, nor can you get in unless
                  you have an obscene amount of unpractical education.<br>
<br>
                  The film is similarly damning and revealing of popular notions
                  of law professors and admissions committees. Professor Stromwell
                  begins her class with an exercise in intimidation and then what
                  ensues is a hyperbolic portrayal of the Socratic method. The
                  effect is that law school is a horribly competitive, stressful
                  environment. In Elle's first criminal law class, Professor Callahan
                  acknowledges the ruthlessness of law school by announcing four
                  summer spots in his firm with the declaration, &quot;let the
                  blood bath begin.&quot; Similarly, the admissions committee lacks
                  any sense of humour or knowledge of life outside of academia,
                  illustrated by their interpretation of Elle's fundraising campaign
                  of a line of faux-fur panties as being &quot;a friend of the
                  animals&quot; and of her frivolous undergraduate degree as &quot;diversity.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  From these stereotypes, and from Elle's conquering of the legal
                  world with her perkiness, we see a dominant ideology that law
                  is a ruthless, competitive and hostile environment. Even though
                  Professor Stromwell comes to the salon and encourages Elle to
                  stay in school, Vivian Kensington becomes her best friend, and
                  her absolutely horrible classmates vote her as their favourite
                  for the position of convocation speaker, this transformation
                  in welcome to the bimbo only occurs because of Elle's genuineness
                  and persistence and not from a hope that the legal profession
                  can have compassion. The change in attitudes at the legal institution
                  does not have the powerful inverting effect that appears in <i>My
                  Cousin Vinny</i> where the South's legal system shows its own
                  merit. Harvard's redemption is reluctant and only through Elle's
                  overwhelming goodness and influence. The inherent potential evilness
                  of the system remains. <br>
<br>
                  Despite affirming a malicious undercurrent to the entire legal
                  profession, there is a contrary and very real ideology legitimizing
                  law throughout the film. The mere fact that Elle must prove herself
                  in the legal forum gives legitimacy to the profession as a place
                  of prestige and authority. The film gives credence to law school
                  as a place for smart people when Elle can no longer identify
                  with her Californian friends whose news about bangs and lip liner
                  interrupts Elle's story of emotional crisis and rejection. Likewise,
                  the audience is glad that Elle rejects the empty life of beauty
                  pageants and martinis that her mother and father embrace. Their
                  gross frivolity makes even Harvard desirable. This idea that
                  law school is a place of prestige and respectability is an underlying
                  ideological assumption confirmed through decades and centuries
                  and remains unchallenged by this film.<br>
<br>
                  The entire purpose of the film attempts to underscore assumptions
                  about the blonde bimbo. From a woman who cannot continue to walk
                  home because of a threat to her shoes, we get a woman who wins
                  a murder trial in her first year as a law student and then receives
                  a prestigious offer in a large Boston firm. The attempted message
                  of the film is that the bimbo is really brilliant. This is the
                  same ideological message that <i>My Cousin Vinny </i>presents
                  about Lisa but it lacks the same poignancy because the outcome
                  is so transparent from the opening scenes of the film. Similarly,
                  there is a question if this is even really the ideological message
                  or is it merely that a girl has to do anything to get a great
                  guy? The actual evidence that Elle is smart is fleeting. She
                  makes some observant comments in class and has clearly read but
                  then her behaviour on Callahan's legal team is embarrassing (for
                  example: &quot;I just don't think that Brooke could have done
                  this. She exercises a lot. Exercise creates endorphins and endorphins
                  make you happy. Happy people just don't kill their husbands&quot;).
                  The film does this to extend the bimbo joke, and Reese Witherspoon
                  is incredibly charming, but by extending this bimbo-ness, the
                  film actually undermines if Elle really is smart.<br>
<br>
                  Everything in this film centers on the creation of utopian romance
                  and not on inverting conceptions about the bimbo. Elle's help
                  to Paulette, the white trash manicurist, is in helping her to
                  connect with the UPS guy. Similarly, she does a great service
                  to the de-worming law student by making him look desirable in
                  the face of rejection. Elle's entire purpose in going to law
                  school stems not from ambition to do something greater with her
                  life, nor from a passion for justice, but is rather a function
                  of marital conquest. When she rejects Warner and then subsequently
                  gives a relatively intelligent speech at their graduation, we
                  wonder if Elle has transcended this marital quest. The musical
                  score with the lyrics of &quot;Perfect Day&quot; is the same
                  as in the initial scene of her getting ready for her date with
                  Warner when she expects him to propose. We think that now her
                  perception of the perfect day has changed to career success and
                  recognition of hard work and of coming to terms with self but
                  then a subtitle under her new boyfriend, Emmitt, reverses this
                  inclination. The subtitle indicates that this is really the perfect
                  day because he will propose that night. Now she will marry the
                  perfect guy. Law school was worth it.<br>
<br>
                  As a blonde who uses an ibook and who saw <i>Legally Blonde</i>
                  on the day of receiving an acceptance to law school, I really
                  like Elle Woods. However, the ideological message fails to present
                  women as autonomous, competent individuals deserving of respect.
                  <i>My Cousin Vinny</i> does a much better job of this through
                  using Bohdan Dziemidok's Contrast Theory to create a gap between
                  our expectations of Lisa and what actually ensues. Both films,
                  however, use obvious stereotypes and force reflections on cultural
                  assumptions that we make. A good trend for feminism is that Hollywood
                  film has changed to make the ideological assumption that bimbos
                  are more than they have traditionally been seen to be. Let's
                  just hope that there are more Mona Lisa Vitos than there are
