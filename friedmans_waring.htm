                  by Rob Waring</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Capturing the Friedmans</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">, now in theaters, is a likely Oscar
                  contender for best documentary. The film tracks the disintegration
                  of a family whose patriarch is arrested for child molestation.
                  Director Andrew Jarecki's skill makes the film an emotional roller
                  coaster for the viewer. After one interview, you believe one
                  interpretation of what happened, and a few minutes later you
                  find your loyalties shifting to the other side - just until the
                  next bombshell hits. (Another great documentary, <i>American
                  Movie</i>, toyed with the viewer's perspective on the subjects'
                  morality in much the same way.)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/friedman2.jpg" width="191" height="150" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">One
                  of the key questions raised by the film is the extent to which
                  films should serve as a means to correct injustice. If it is
                  assumed that the system is not perfect and that mistakes will
                  be made, do films about mistakes in specific cases serve some
                  broader purpose that makes the system better or do they simply
                  decrease people's confidence in the system without leading to
                  changes that increase the chances of better results? Should The
                  Innocence Project have a film division to spur change in the
                  criminal justice system through the political process? Is the
                  media so filled with scary stories about child molesters that
                  <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i> is unlikely to have any measurable
                  effect?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After the preview I attended,
                  the director answered questions from the audience. If you decide
                  to explore the issues in the film further with friends or in
                  discussion group, here are some thought-provoking facts he shared,
                  along with others gleaned from radio interviews that aired after
                  the film's release.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Jarecki started to make film
                  about clowns for hire at New York children's birthday parties.
                  He was many months into that project when he learned David's
                  family history and began to turn the film into a story about
                  the Friedmans. The turning point came when Jarecki took David
                  back to visit the family home in Great Neck, and the family now
                  living there let David spend some time in his old bedroom. David
                  began to open up to Jarecki after that, apparently realizing
                  that the story of the events in Great Neck needed to be told.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Susan Orlean, who wrote <i>The
                  Orchid Thief</i>, which became the movie <i>Adaptation</i>, wrote
                  a New Yorker article about David being the most popular children's
                  clown in New York City in 1994, and only learned that he was
                  the son of a convicted child molester after the article was published.
                  She said in a recent interview that because of David's family
                  history, she would not hire him to perform at a party for her
                  children. David also has a clown act for adult parties, where
                  he specializes in making balloons into genitalia. Should these
                  facts have been included in the film?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">When I asked the director how
                  the making the film changed his view of the justice system, he
                  talked about the how the story was reported in the press at the
                  time, and how the reporting was so prejudicial. A lawyer who
                  was with me commented that the director had not answered my question.
                  But he did, I replied; the case was tried in the media. Once
                  the charges were brought, the community's reaction made the outcome
                  of the trial a foregone conclusion. Even the judge admits her
                  mind was made up from the Friedmans' first court appearance.
                  Jarecki regards each screening of the film as the trial the defendants
                  never had. He has a version five and a half hours long ready
                  for the DVD release.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The judge refused to grant
                  a change of venue motion, but did grant scores of press requests
                  for cameras in the courtroom. She remains absolutely convinced
                  that she did everything right in the cases shown in the film,
                  and has asked the director for a signed publicity poster for
                  the film. She attended early previews of the film before conducting
                  a hearing concerning Jesse's sex offender registration status.
                  Convinced that his insistence that he has not molested anyone
                  made him at risk of repeating his crimes, she assigned him to
                  the highest risk category upon his release from prison. It took
                  him six months to find a place to live because of fears about
                  his past. For the rest of his life, his movements will be constantly
                  monitored by an electronic bracelet. He cannot go to parks or
                  any place where there are children. He must be home at night
                  after 7 PM. He must attend twice weekly sex offender group therapy
                  where the entire subject of discussion is molestation. The judge
                  recently retired and teaches ballroom dancing on cruise ships.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Three friends of Jesse's were
                  prosecuted, convicted and sent to jail for the alleged molestations.
                  The police went to each boy in turn and told him that the others
                  had confessed and implicated him. Each refused to cooperate,
                  insisting on their innocence. Finally, the youngest was offered
                  a deal that he would be treated as a juvenile, serve six months
                  in a youth facility and have his record sealed if he testified
                  against the others. He agreed and testified as requested, but
                  then the judge rejected his deal and sentenced him as an adult
                  to two years. The young snitch appealed and the appellate court
                  ordered the judge to honor his deal. The others, who maintained
                  their innocence, received six years.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The pleas made by the defendants
                  occurred before two hung juries in the contemporaneous McMartin
                  day care center molestation case caused those charges to be dismissed.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Under a pseudonym, the postal
                  inspector wrote to Arnie, the father, many times over a two-year
                  period until Arnie finally sent him some child pornography as
                  requested.</font></p>


                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Jarecki says everyone in the
                  film told him things he later discovered were not true, except
                  Jesse Friedman. Jesse says he hopes that the film will cause
                  some of the computer class students to recant their previous
                  statements implicating him, but so far that has not happened.</font></p>
