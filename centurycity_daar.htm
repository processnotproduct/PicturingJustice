                  Cloning: Drama Gone Wild</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Judith F. Daar<br>
                  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The familiar adage that science
                  outpaces law at every turn yields a treasure trove of source
                  material for creators of dramatic fiction. This past decade alone
                  saw a veritable gush of scientific advances that are stand-alone
                  plot lines of intrigue, mystery and drama. Witness the burgeoning
                  yet politically charged debate over human stem cell research,
                  the public/private alliance that unraveled the identity of the
                  human genome, and of course, there was Dolly, everybody's favorite
                  cloned sheep.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">With these life science advances
                  as its backdrop, CBS recently premiered <i>Century City</i>,
                  a new mid-season drama that drops viewers in a Los Angeles law
                  firm, circa 2030. To reify the futuristic genre of the show,
                  the writers offer two storylines pulled from the imagined headlines
                  two decades hence. The first episode's main plot weaves the tale
                  of a 7-year old boy born with a defective liver in need of a
                  transplant whose father whisks him off to Singapore to be cloned,
                  thus creating an identical organ for harvest. The sub-plot ponders
                  the merits of age-defying genetic enhancements, taken up with
                  seemingly remarkable success by members of a 1980s boy band.
                  Though placed a generation in the future, these dramatic enactments
                  reflect a contemporary sensibility about genetic and reproductive
                  technologies that is dangerously misinformed.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By all accounts, <i>Century
                  City</i> will not find its way back to the fall line-up, opening
                  a dismal 45th in the ratings following a collective thumbs down
                  by reviewers. &quot;Gratingly preachy&quot; offered Robert Bianco
                  of USA Today; &quot;sterile and formulaic&quot; hurled Matthew
                  Gilbert of the Boston Globe; &quot;humdrum casting and a dead-end
                  concept&quot; proclaimed Tom Shales of the Washington Post, and
                  those were the good reviews. Yet despite this deserved panning
                  of the show as an entertainment vehicle, <i>Century City</i>
                  offers an opportunity to spend a moment reflecting on the relationship
                  between popular culture and science, particularly science that
                  literally operates at the core of human existence.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A peek at the <i>CC</i> plot
                  reveals much about the current perception that cloning technology
                  will be used for the diabolical manufacture of human beings rather
                  than as a reproductive measure of last resort for incurable infertility.
                  At the outset, we are introduced to Axel Sisto, the ailing boy
                  whose father has been arrested by the Customs Service for entering
                  the country with a vial containing a cloned human embryo. Turns
                  out, sometime in the past 25 years Congress outlawed cloning
                  in the U.S., including the importation of cloned cells. Axel's
                  father, Miller, travels with his son to Singapore where cloning
                  is legal. There, according to the young lawyer briefing the firm
                  in <i>L.A. Law</i> fashion, doctors removed a cell from the boy's
                  arm, extracted its DNA and created a viable embryo which was
                  destined for a surrogate mother when it was intercepted by the
                  feds. The father's plan, but of course, is to orchestrate the
                  cloned child's birth so that a surgeon can remove half of his
                  liver for transplant into his dying twin brother.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Undaunted by this nefarious
                  scheme, the firm agrees to handle the case on a pro bono basis.
                  Its mission B to win back the detained embryo from the government.
                  Enter the Assistant United States Attorney, oozing unction at
                  every pore, who argues in a virtual courtroom pretrial hearing
                  that the embryo is not property and therefore cannot be claimed
                  for possession by the father. The judge agrees that the case
                  should be heard by a jury which, in television terms, means stay
                  tuned after the commercial break. But before the speedy trial
                  ensues, the father huddles with his lawyers and pipes up with
                  a sure-fire strategy to defeat the government's argument that
                  the embryo should be treated as a person under the law. What
                  if, he suggests haltingly, we &quot;pinch off&quot; the embryo
                  so that only the liver and supporting circulatory system develop.
                  No head, no heart, voila -- no person. This, I fear, is where
                  the ethical rubber meets the fantastical road to Doomsdayville.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Portrayals of human cloning
                  as a method of organ farming, or worse, sanctioned killing via
                  the systematic removal of body parts, is dangerously inflammatory
                  and scientifically inaccurate. As to the former, <i>CC</i> is
                  littered with language convicting cloning of dooming the human
                  species, describing a post-cloning world as one devoid of all
                  humanity. This point is best captured during the predictably
                  melodramatic courtroom scene when, in delivering his closing
                  argument, the prosecutor snarls that the father is trying to
                  retrieve the cloned embryo so that he can &quot;grow it like
                  a crop.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The only countervailing imagery
                  to this Robin Cook vision of cloning comes in the form of a plot
                  twist. When pressed about the origin of his son's birth, Miller
                  confesses that Axel is himself a clone, a genetic twin of his
                  father. Snippets of <i>Chinatown</i> My brother! My Son! do flare,
                  as the family law angle parades briefly across the screen. But
                  instead of seizing the moment to note that the child appears
                  to have a normal, healthy relationship with the world around
                  him, the lawyers emphasize the boy's congenital liver defect,
                  perhaps as a subtle reminder (lest we ignored the crashing hammer
                  on our heads) that cloning equals harm.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As to the technical possibilities
                  that cloning entails, again the show takes dramatic liberties
                  that infringe on reality's comfort zone. To begin, if the father
                  did manage to orchestrate the clone's birth, he certainly could
                  not yank out the child's vital organs to save his other son.
                  That would be old-fashioned homicide and would have to be referred
                  to CBS's other new drama, <i>The D.A.</i> Moreover, the idea
                  that an embryo could be &quot;pinched off&quot; or partially
                  grown defies the basic principles of human embryology. Exactly
                  when would this embryo be decapitated, and why would it survive
                  without a central nervous system? And finally, I admit to nitpicking
                  when I wonder why a father would clone a child born with a defective
                  liver, in order to offer the ailing boy the cloned liver. Hello,
                  the cloned liver would bear the same defect as that of cell donor.
                  But these finer points could distract from the furious plucking
                  of heartstrings that are the viewer's constant companion.<br>
<br>
                  <i>CC</i> is not alone in taking up the cloning mantle in dramatic
                  fashion. The 1978 film version of Ira Levin's chilling novel,
                  <i>The Boys From Brazil</i>, features Nazi escapees who succeed
                  in cloning 94 newborn versions of the twentieth century's most
                  reviled individual. The horde of Hitlers are placed in adoptive
                  homes that roughly resemble the Fuhrer's own family situation.
                  And then as each boy nears age fourteen, his father dies, as
                  did Hitler's own father at that time, thus recreating the hospitable
                  environment that will allow each mini-Hitler to become evil incarnate.
                  A less diabolical but equally absurd cloning rendition is presented
                  in <i>Multiplicity</i>, wherein overworked family man Michael
                  Keaton manages to clone himself several times over so that he
                  can attain the American dream of all work, all play, all the
                  time. The &quot;wacky&quot; antics that ensue leave wife Andie
                  MacDowell dazed and confused, while the audience is never confused
                  about the Hollywood message to &quot;just be yourself.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Fictionalized accounts of scientific
                  advances are often bereft of even a modicum of scientific truth.
                  A cloned Hitler, were that ever a possibility, could not experience
                  the same familial and historical influences that shaped the man
                  himself short of the truly extraordinary invention of a time
                  machine. Cloned individuals may bear the same genetic code as
                  another person, but they will grow from embryo to fetus in the
                  womb just like everybody else, and they will experience the world
                  in their own unique way, just like everybody else. Clones are
                  not born as adults with an implanted frame of reference, but
                  rather begin life as a single cell whose DNA comes from one,
                  instead of two, parents.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the non-reel world, human
                  reproductive cloning remains a twinkle in the scientist's eye.
                  Short of bare claims by a group pledging fidelity to a leader
                  claiming contact with space aliens, it is safe to say the world's
                  first human clone has yet to be born. But when that child does
                  emerge from the womb, he or she will join a world at war with
                  itself over the ethics of that baby's conception. To date, seven
                  U.S. states have banned reproductive cloning, with virtually
                  every other state considering similar measures. Congress has
                  yet to enact a ban, as the issue is bound up with the more palatable
                  technique of therapeutic cloning, aka stem cell research. Worldwide,
                  cloning to produce children is illegal in twenty nations, and
                  the United Nations is poised to include an international convention
                  on reproductive human cloning on the General Assembly's agenda
                  for the fall of 2004. Gallup polls consistently reveal that almost
                  90% of those questioned believe reproductive cloning is wrong.
                  But the follow-up question, Why?, is never posed.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I suspect that a small but
                  significant part of the explanation rests in the popular culture
                  portrayals of cloning as science gone awry. True enough, stories
                  of healthy, happy families are an anachronism unbecoming the
                  crucial 18-49 demographic. But is it too much to ask that the
                  truth about what cloning is and what it is not play a supporting
                  role in the unfolding drama that pits mad science against a yielding
                  and powerless human species? If it turns out that <i>Century
                  City</i> is as doomed as the science of cloning, it has only
                  itself to blame. <br>
