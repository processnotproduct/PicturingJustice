                  by Judith Grant<br>
<br>
                  Martin Scorsese&#146;s latest film, <i>Gangs of New York</i>
                  is a failed anti-war <br>
                  film. It is 165 minutes of some of the most violent footage ever
                  seen in a film intended for mainstream entertainment. As a fan
                  of Scorsese&#146;s, I have to say that even the brutality of
                  <i>Good Fellas</i> could not have prepared me for the assault
                  that is the experience of watching this film. Even leaving aside
                  the violence, I admit that I am mystified by all the hoopla surrounding
                  <i>Gangs of New Yor</i>k. Leonardo Di Caprio only slightly adapts
                  the role he had in Titanic. Now instead of a sweet Irish immigrant,
                  he is a nasty one. Cameron Diaz appears to have thought the Irish
                  accent was optional, as it fades in and out about every fifth
                  word. For his part, Daniel Day-Lewis looks and sounds too much
                  like Dustin Hoffman&#146;s Ratso Rizzo to be truly convincing.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/gangs.jpg" width="176" height="117" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Worse, the film is so thematically
                  confusing that it is at first not clear what Scorsese is trying
                  to say. To be sure the choice of material is worthy. The plight
                  of working class immigrants in 19th century New York City, and
                  the Draft Riots of 1863 have, to my knowledge, been given no
                  filmic attention. Even more intriguing are the possibilities
                  inherent in Scorsese&#146;s observations about the interplay
                  between the nativist sentiments embodied in Daniel Day-Lewis&#146;
                  character, Bill the Butcher, and the corruption of the US government.
                  Taking place as it does during the American Civil War when Boss
                  Tweed held New York City in his grip, the film&#146;s setting
                  certainly provides ample opportunity for some reflections on
                  these important topics. In fact, I think the message of this
                  film is as disturbing as the way it is told. It would seem that
                  Scorsese intended to make a film that was anti-war, but ended
                  up with one that is anti-government and anti-law.<br>
<br>
                  In brief, <i>Gangs of New York</i> is the story of two rival
                  gangs, one <br>
                  &#147;nativist&#148; lead by Bill the Butcher. The other, a group
                  of Irish immigrants called &#147;The Dead Rabbits&#148; initially
                  lead by a man called &#147;The Priest Vallon&#148; (Liam Neeson).
                  The Priest meets an early demise at the hands of Bill, and his
                  death is witnessed by his young son, the unlikely named, Amsterdam
                  Vallon (Leonardo Di Caprio). The son spends the next 16 years
                  in Roman Catholic (St. Amsterdam?) reform school plotting his
                  revenge. It is a familiar story and an almost Shakespearean tragedy
                  (think Hamlet). Upon his release, Amsterdam comes to know and
                  even to like Bill quite well. They are both, in fact, enamored
                  of the same woman, Jenny Everdeane (Cameron <br>
                  Diaz). This is the only female character of note and her dramatic
                  function appears to be primarily to mitigate Bill and Amsterdam&#146;s
                  almost erotic fixation with one another. (Several critics have
                  complained that her character&#146;s development is abandoned
                  relatively early in the film, and this might explain why). In
                  any event,Amsterdam becomes deeply connected to Bill and ambivalent
                  about the revenge he knows he must exact. In one of the film&#146;s
                  most significant (and least bloody) scenes, Bill, draped in an
                  American flag, sits next to Amsterdam (who happens to be in bed
                  with Jenny at the time) and tells a tale that, though harrowing,
                  explains his enormous respect for Priest Vallon. Vallon, Bill
                  intones, is the only man he has ever killed who was worth killing.
                  Much is made throughout the film of he Priest&#146;s dying words
                  to his son, that one must never &#147;look away.&#148; Indeed,
                  the eyes of an honorable man, Scorsese suggests, are able to
                  look death in the face.<br>
<br>
                  This drama involving male honor and homoeroticism is played against
                  the backdrop of Boss Tweed&#146;s New York. Thus, honor and vigilantism
                  are juxtaposed to chicanery and secrecy, with government and
                  the law representing the latter. It is Boss Tweed who does not
                  look into the faces of his enemies since they change depending
                  on who can further his political career. Scorsese&#146;s shots
                  of immigrants coming off ships that are then loaded with the
                  caskets of dead Union soldiers are cinematically superb as are,
                  I admit, some of the most bloody battles on film. Immigrants
                  no sooner arrive than they are told to sign papers that make
                  them citizens. In the next second, they are conscripted into
                  the army, handed rifles, and sent to fight men with whom they
                  have no quarrel. To depict this irony, the film&#146;s gang sequences
                  are often inter-cut with Civil War battle scenes. America, Scorsese
                  wants to contend, was forged in blood. With this he appears to
                  have no quarrel. What troubles him is the way blood is spilled.
                  On this point, the film has a very definite point of view.<br>
<br>
                  Much is made of the desirability of fighting with ones hands
                  or with <br>
                  implements like knives and cleavers. Guns, it would seem, do
                  not bring <br>
                  honor or glory. Likewise, one ought to be connected to the fight,
                  and to see and know one&#146;s enemy in a way that is as immediate
                  as it is close to real rage. The Union army does not fit this
                  bill, and presumably, things have only gotten worse since then.
                  In the end when the two gangs pow-wow and agree to have a penultimate
                  battle, Amsterdam chooses not to use guns to which Bill the Butcher
                  responds approvingly, &#147;good boy.&#148; Government forces
                  are sent to quell the rioting, however. Canon fire kills almost
                  everyone on both sides, and the look of bewilderment that passes
                  between Bill and Amsterdam is, I think, meant to show their acknowledgement
                  of the fact that the rules of battle have changed. Their way
                  of fighting is over.<br>
<br>
                  Fighting is now accomplished through technology and the warrior
                  may not even understand the reasons that he fights let alone
                  see his enemy. Voice-overs repeatedly underscore that &#147;this&#148;
                  is America. Which? The violence? The technology? The Law?<br>
<br>
                  Just as Sergio Leone did in his masterful <i>Once Upon a Time
                  in America</i>, Scorsese sees two Americas. One, an America of
                  law, and one an America of justice. For Scorsese justice stands
                  outside the law. It is an America where fearless and loyal men
                  of strong wills and backs respect their enemies even as they
                  kill them. Upon reflection, this fetishism of male organized
                  violence is Scorsese&#146;s calling card, and it at least partly
                  explains his life-long fascination with the Italian-American
                  mafia. <br>
<br>
                  Likewise, he recognizes the sub textual connection between America&#146;s
<br>
                  poorest immigrants and African Americans. However, it is disturbing
                  that, in this film, black men remain only an absent presence.
                  They are clearly invoked insofar as the Civil War has everything
                  to do with slavery and race. Yet, they have almost no role in
                  Scorsese&#146;s drama. He correctly shows the racism of both
                  nativists and Irish as a product of hellish lives in which rage
                  is allowed to fester in the unfreedom of poverty. The parallel
                  story of the slave is left un-thematized. Though Amsterdam Vallon
                  is shown to have at least one black acquaintance, the meat of
                  the story is, for Scorsese, about struggles among white men.<br>
<br>
                  If war has become a sad statement on manly virtues, the law is
                  an even worse one. Boss Tweed&#146;s hypocritical attempts to
                  buy immigrant votes, and his cynical alliance with whichever
                  gang can deliver said votes are surely examples of some of the
                  most repugnant and recurrent moments in our nation&#146;s history.
                  Yet this film appears to see these as the rule rather than the
                  exception. In one telling set of scenes, the Irishman Monk McGinn
                  (Brendan Gleeson) is drafted by Tweed and Amsterdam to run for
                  elected office. In this instance, there is hope that the Irish
                  immigrants might abandon their gangs and turn to the law for
                  empowerment and help. In this they are disappointed, and Monk
                  is murdered. Therefore, the only law for the poor and the immigrant
                  is the law of the streets and the rule of the gangs. It is as
                  though two parallel legal systems existed side by side, and Scorsese
                  is completely clear about which he believes to be the most useful
<br>
                  and the more virtuous.<br>
<br>
                  The final shot of the film is as visually stunning as it is controversial.
<br>
                  Shot across the Brooklyn Bridge looking to the New York skyline,
                  Amsterdam and Jenny walk off the screen and fade to ghosts. Amsterdam&#146;s
                  voice-over tells us that New York City was built on the blood
                  of such nameless heroes. The shot shows New York City expanding
                  over time in a frame-by-frame dissolve until it rests on a New
                  York skyline complete with the twin towers. Why this editorial
                  decision? Why not fade to the final shot everyone in the audience
                  expects, NYC sans Towers? Visual effects supervisor Michael Owens
                  says that, &quot;By September 11 we had already shot the plates
                  and were actually well into creating the shot, and suddenly it
                  became a real issue. Originally it was designed as one of those
                  quintessential views of New York, but after September 11 some
                  worried that the sequence might take on an entirely different
                  meaning.&#148; And indeed, it <br>
                  did. Had he done that last final shot without the towers one
                  might have inferred a kind of critique of violence. Violence
                  begets more violence. <br>
<br>
                  Hence, the vanished towers. Instead, the decision to allow us
                  to linger on the beauty of the intact city allows us to absorb
                  his notion this <br>
                  spectacular scene is the result of spilled blood, and that vengeance
                  is an acceptable solution. Since Mr. Scorsese is among those
                  celebrities who have recently come out against a war with Iraq,
                  his decision on this point remains a puzzle.</font></p>
