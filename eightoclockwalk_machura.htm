                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A nightmare could start like
                  the British film <i>Eight O' Clock Walk</i>, released 1953. However,
                  a loving woman and an attentive barrister save the day. <i>Eight
                  O' Clock Walk</i> has been overlooked by most law and film scholars
                  so far. Halliwell's Film and Video Guide (2000, 247) judges <i>Eight
                  O' Clock Walk</i> as follows: &quot;Minor-league courtroom stuff,
                  an adequate time-passer&quot;. Hal Erickson, at least, disagreed.
                  In a text on director Lance Comfort, he wrote: &quot;Many of
                  his postwar efforts, notably <i>Eight O' Clock Walk</i>..., were
                  distinguished by their creative utilization of actual locations
                  and well-sustained levels of suspense&quot;. &quot;The iniquities
                  of circumstantial evidence are explored in the compact crime
                  drama <i>Eight O' Clock Walk</i>. ... Based on a true story,
                  <i>Eight O' Clock Walk </i>is one of the most oft-telecast of
                  1950s British films, and deservedly so&quot; (Erickson). The
                  Lexikon des internationalen Films (1997/98) does not even list
                  <i>Eight O' Clock Walk</i>. This usually means that a movie did
                  not appear in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Indeed, the movies
                  deserves attention as a typical trial film. This essay describes
                  the film following the order of its scenes and explores its meaning,
                  which is still relevant for a contemporary audience.<br>
<br>
                  Postcard views of London open the movie <i>Eight O' Clock Walk</i>.
                  The establishing shots locate us at the place and time of the
                  story. Ordinary street scenes among them, but also a view of
                  Old Bailey, the famous London courthouse. Children appear on
                  a London street, they are making April-fool jokes. A man's voice
                  offscreen begins talking, introducing his story. It is Tom (Thomas
                  Leslie) Manning's story. The protagonist (played by Richard Attenborough)
                  has just married, he tells us. When he says farewell to his darling
                  and starts walking along the street, the crucial events begin.
                  A little school girl, Irene Evens, whom we saw before joking
                  with her friends, stands in Manning's way. She is crying. Good
                  hearted Manning gives her his handkerchief. She takes it and
                  says that she has lost her dog. Manning follows her into a neighboring
                  bombsite to help find the dog. Somewhere in the bombsite, the
                  girl shouts &quot;Ha-ha, April foo-ool&quot; and runs off. Manning
                  jokingly follows her, falls on the ground and threatens her with
                  his raised fist. Mrs. Zunz (Lilly Kann) witnesses this scene.<br>
<br>
                  Alone again Irene is feeding ducks at the river bank, singing
                  a song about Old Bailey. The dark shadow of a man is falling
                  over her. A shrill steam engine whistle is heard, sounding frightening.
                  As the viewer suddenly understands, this sound indicates death.
                  Later scenes show the search for the missing girl, the detection
                  of her strangled body, Manning's arrest and the murderer's shadow
                  near children again. The police busily collects circumstantial
                  evidence: the handkerchief, the soil on Manning's coat from the
                  murder site, as well as the testimony of Mrs. Zunz. She states
                  that she saw Manning fighting with the girl. Also, a Horace Clifford
                  tells the police he watched Manning walking with the girl into
                  the bombsite. Up to this point of the film, the viewer knows
                  that an innocent man is arrested and that a dangerous madman
                  is still free. <br>
<br>
                  Manning's wife Jill (Cathy O'Donnell is characterised as &quot;US
                  star&quot; by McFarlane 1999, 144) contacts lawyers to seek help.
                  But the legal professionals do not appear engaged in the case.
                  On top of all, the defending barrister refuses to see her and
                  her imprisoned husband, because he wants to preserve an &quot;objective
                  view&quot; on the case. <br>
                  &quot;Means they are not even interested, I suppose it's because
                  we are not paying anything. ... Doctors - see you, talk to you,
                  give you help. Lawyers - they stay on the outside and make you
                  stay there, too&quot;, is her opinion. <br>
<br>
                  After numerous interrogations by police and a psychologist, Manning
                  already starts to doubt his mind. Did he-suffering from a head-wound
                  from his times as a war pilot-have a &quot;blackout&quot;? We
                  see the wife's figure very small before the prison door. We see
                  her encouraging Manning in the prison. We see Mrs. Manning visiting
                  the barrister's office again. A clerk tries to send her away
                  but Peter Tanner (Derek Farr), the junior counsellor in her husband's
                  case invites her into his office. In their exchange, Mrs. Manning
                  contrasts the old legal practice on the one hand and humanity
                  and life on the other. A client needs encouragement, not detached
                  professional expertise. Tanner, moved by this, visits Manning
                  in prison, believes in his pledge of innocence and makes the
                  case his own.<br>
<br>
                  The trial day comes. In a nicely set scene, a number of women
                  are polishing the courthouse floor. They are exchanging what
                  they have learned about the pending case from the papers. In
                  another scene, a middle-aged lady discusses the death penalty,
                  opposing it principally, sketching out the proponents' view as:
                  &quot;You have to hang someone.&quot; She is a juror to Manning's
                  case, we learn. Next we learn that the young defender's father
                  will prosecute the case. Film scholar McFarlane (1999, 144) notes
                  that:<br>
                  &quot;The rival court appearances of Geoffrey Tanner Q.C. ...
                  and his son, Peter ..., who makes his debut in court as the Manning's
                  defence counsel when the barrister appointed for that purpose
                  is unable to appear. The two exchange a number of 'my learned
                  friend' and other conventional legal ripostes in court and go
                  off arm in arm at the end. In fact, the film's last image is
                  of them walking away from the camera. Their camaraderie is in
                  the West End theatre's jocular mode, and the only discernible
                  point of spending time on them is ... to suggest the incorruptibility
                  of British justice: whatever their feelings for another, they
                  are perfectly able to carry out the necessary legal procedures
                  on opposite sides of the case.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  As another means to show the incorruptibility of the justice
                  system, McFarlane (1999, 144) mentions the figure of the presiding
                  Justice Harrington (Harry Welchman). The viewer learns that Harrington's
                  wife is in hospital that very morning for a dangerous surgery.
                  She will later die under the anaesthetic. To add to the dramatic
                  constellation at the beginning of the trial, the now familiar
                  shadow appears again, falling on the announcement of the case
                  in the court hall. <br>
<br>
                  A powerful series of detailed court scenes filmed in Old Bailey
                  shows the start of the spectacle. The judge is dressed in his
                  wardrobe. Officials are waiting backstage. Finally the judge
                  is announced and enters the courtroom. In the cellar under the
                  court room, the defendant and his wardens are waiting. Summoned
                  as a witness, Manning walks upstairs into his dock. Everyone
                  is staring at him.</font></p>

                  <font size="-1" face="Verdana">The trial develops quite unfavorably
                  for the defendant and his young barrister. The camera depicts
                  Tanner in despair (Picture above). The prosecutor impresses the
                  jury by passing photos of the victim's body. <br>
                  Social psychological research demonstrated: the more severe the
                  pains and damage inflicted by a perpetrator, the tougher the
                  penalty advocated by beholders (e.g. Vidmar and Miller 1980,
                  584-5, Zamble and Kalm 1990, 334-5). To show photos of wounded
                  bodies to the jury serves as an effective strategy of the prosecution
                  in U.S. capital cases (Sarat 1995, 1124-7).<br>
<br>
                  Austin Sarat (1995, 1127) quotes a woman juror who voted for
                  the death penalty in a case: &quot;Normally I consider myself
                  a liberal easterner transplanted here to Georgia and against
                  capital punishment - always was - but after I saw that picture
                  of that man, something popped. I saw the pictures of him slumped
                  down behind the counter and he was shot at somewhere around here
                  and behind the ear, that was terrible. (...) I think about it
                  even now and it bothers me very much.&quot; <br>
<br>
                  Later in <i>Eight O' Clock Walk</i>, the judge frightens Mrs.
                  Zunz, the lady witness from the bombsite, with a fine for leaving
                  the court building temporarily. She is a foreigner (a German!)
                  obviously not knowing how to behave before an English court of
                  law. To the viewer, she appears quite simple-minded, certainly
                  not able to differentiate between a joke and a real danger. The
                  movie skips her testimony, but its content is clear. <br>
<br>
                  Then Mr. Clifford gives evidence, followed by a woman reporting
                  that she saw Manning in a dusty coat. A school comrade of Irene
                  recalled that Manning once asked him whether he had a small sister.
                  Then, on the witness stand, Irene's mother gives hearsay evidence
                  that Manning gave the victim sweets and allegedly has been after
                  her. When the mother breaks down in tears, the first adjournment
                  is ordered. On the second day, the mother continues her testimony,
                  talking about the girl's habit to feed ducks on the river bank
                  before school. <br>
<br>
                  At the moment, when the defense begins to present its case, the
                  judge interrupts for a second adjournment. His daughter informs
                  the judge that his wife did not wake up after the anaesthetic.
                  Nevertheless, the judge is able to continue with the trial. Finally,
                  the defendant testifies under oath. The judge interrupts an attempt
                  by the prosecutor to provoke Manning unduly with his questions.
<br>
<br>
                  Time for the final arguments. The prosecutor appeals to the jury:
                  &quot;... your duty, your CLEAR duty to return a verdict of guilty.&quot;
                  The judge suggests a break for lunch. Although they are not allowed
                  to, the jurors are starting to discuss the case, having not even
                  heard the defense's arguments. The lady juror we know from before
                  is now, like some of her colleagues, convinced of Manning's guilt.
                  Warned by another juror, she states: &quot;Our duty is to do
                  what we think is right.&quot; Up to now the situation has only
                  changed from bad to worse for the defendant.<br>
<br>
                  The following scenes show the real murderer. Manning's wife and
                  Tanner are sitting in a restaurant when Tanner detects a child
                  holding a sweet like the one found with the dead body. A moment
                  before, Tanner (but not the audience) saw who gave it to her,
                  understands the connections, and back in court calls Horace Clifford
                  (Maurice Denham) to the witness stand. Clifford is confronted
                  with the similarity of the sweets. A street musician is instructed
                  to play the same Old Bailey song that was played when Clifford
                  gave the sweet to the child in front of the restaurant. It is
                  the same song that was sung by the victim at the murder site
                  (The audience knows this but Tanner does not). Clifford breaks
                  down. (Denham's play very much conforms to the popular stereotype
                  of a psychopathic child-killer.) His hat is falling on the floor
                  - just like a cut off head at the execution.<br>
<br>
                  The title of the movie has a double meaning. On the one hand,
                  an eight o' clock walk is just a walk around eight. (Manning
                  started his a little late that morning, almost at nine.) On the
                  other hand, and most important here, an eight o'clock walk means
                  death. It refers to the hour at which executions are termed.<br>
<br>
                  On the BBC, conservative MP Ann Widdecomb recently speculated
                  in public about the re-introduction of the death penalty to British
                  law. It has been suspended &quot;indefinitely&quot; by Parliament
                  in 1969. Later European law totally extinguished the death penalty.
                  MP Widdecomb is quoted: &quot;I would also like some of the ritual
                  to go away, the black cap, the eight o'clock walk - none of these
                  are necessary&quot;. A pollster, Ben Page, reports that three-quarters
                  of the UK population consistently favour the death penalty &quot;in
                  some circumstances&quot; (BBC). Voices like these make films
                  such as <i>Eight O' Clock Walk</i> a timeless warning.<br>
<br>
                  Indeed, <i>Eight O' Clock Walk</i> may be read as an anti-capital
                  penalty picture. Then, the message would be: Look, everyone can
                  be mistakenly accused and only by fortune the innocent gets away.
                  Circumstantial evidence might be enough to result in death. -
                  Brian McFarlane (1999, 145) writes that <br>
                  &quot;the film's real interest is in the process of the judicial
                  system and the dangers of circumstantial evidence. Considering
                  the debate that was raging at the time about capital punishment,
                  it is only weakly polemical ...&quot; <br>
<br>
                  But why, then, is not the film title &quot;Circumstantial Evidence,&quot;
                  if that is the main focus? However, McFarlane is right that the
                  film does not present its message too directly. Law is depicted
                  as a bureaucratic force. The legal system and some of its personnel
                  appear almost inhuman in their adherence to rigid rules. These
                  rules allow circumstantial evidence. Another of these rules-as
                  refracted by the movie-is that the barrister should not talk
                  to the defendant. For if the defendant pleads not guilty but
                  confesses to the barrister, the latter would be in a terrible
                  position, as Tanner is advised. Manning's wife Jill is American.
                  No wonder she expects a lawyer to fight for the client and search
                  for favorable evidence, as numerous Hollywood movie lawyers do,
                  and as indeed is the role of an American lawyer in criminal trials.<br>
<br>
                  To be sure, the police and the jurists in <i>Eight O' Clock Walk</i>
                  are working routinely and there are no transgressions in any
                  phase, but all these quite proper activities lead to having the
                  wrong man on trial and having the dangerous man still out on
                  the streets. The depiction of the jury is remarkable. In a typical
                  film, it represents the people's good common sense, and also
                  stands for the audience (Machura/Ulbrich 2001). Here, the jury
                  represents a largely biased citizenship. The general picture
                  of the lawyers also is far from positive, despite the laudable
                  figure of young Tanner. Only some very good luck, combined with
                  the adversarial system with some import of engagement from the
                  U.S., saves Manning from the blind bureaucratic machine.<br>
<br>
                  However, it is a parody of the English adversarial system, since
                  the inexperienced lawyer, the one who does like to have a personal
                  bond to his client, the one who has the instinct of a detective
                  and the abilities of a theatre director in framing the culprit
                  saves the innocent. At best, the Tanner figure could have been
                  understood as a promise of future generations of lawyers. The
                  film is staged in the early Fifties when being a barrister meant
                  a socially detached position in any respect. Tanner is ready
                  to encounter his client directly.<br>
<br>
                  Far from legitimising the English legal system, <i>Eight O' Clock
                  Walk</i>, however, is undecided.. One can say, police does its
                  duty, as the prosecutor does, the judge acts more or less reasonably
                  in a most terrible personal situation, and there is a lawyer
                  capable of handling the case. Barriers in getting one's rights
                  are finally overcome. Such aspects essentially weaken the film's
                  critique. But on the other hand: Is not every system somewhere
                  in between perfect and discouraging?<hr align="LEFT"><br>
