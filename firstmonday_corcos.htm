                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Oh, dear. First of all, why
                  did this series premiere on a Tuesday and why will it then air
                  on Fridays? Well, if that were the most important of our questions,
                  we'd be all right.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/first-monday2.jpg" width="180" height="225" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">O.K.,
                  let's get the special pleading out of the way. Yes, the first
                  episode of any series is clogged with characters and situations,
                  in order to get the viewers acclimated. And maybe Executive Producer
                  Bellisario is angry about Bush v. Gore and its seemingly politically-influenced
                  result.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After watching the first few
                  minutes of <i>First Monday</i>, I had the sinking feeling I often
                  get when reading student first drafts. I can identify some interesting
                  ideas in there, but they're camouflaged behind murky thought
                  patterns, cliched writing, superficial analysis, and a lack of
                  intellectual direction. Shall we start with the characters? Or
                  the plot so full of holes you could drive a truck through it?
                  Or the bad dialogue? All of these tax my linguistic ingenuity.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The characters are straight
                  from popular culture images of former and current Supreme Court
                  Justices. Garner's conservative, sports-crazy Chief more interested
                  in Oklahoma's national rankings than in a death-row inmate brush
                  with lightning is a mix of Byron &quot;Whizzer&quot; White (for
                  the sports), and various SCJs, including current CJ William Rehnquist,
                  for the conservatism (and coldness and insensitivity). Are the
                  Justices that sports-crazy? According to a friend who clerked
                  at the Court, some of them are. So that part is accurate. If
                  the writers had made more of it dramatically, it might even be
                  important. Estelle Weisenberg is clearly Ruth Ginsberg without
                  the charm or finesse. Jerome Morris (James McEachin) is Thurgood
                  Marshall-like and thoroughly admirable. Not much you can do with
                  that if you're an actor, though. Apparently Clarence Thomas,
                  who would have been a more interesting template for a justice,
                  is off-limits for political reasons.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The politics of <i>First Monday</i>
                  is another problem. This episode is agenda-laden. Dealing with
                  Novelli's first crisis of conscience, it drags out all the memes
                  associated with capital punishment, the execution of juveniles,
                  and the execution of the mentally disabled. These are important
                  issues. Unfortunately, the writers treat them with dialogue dredged
                  up from film noir. In the interests of full disclosure, I will
                  admit that I am a knee-jerk liberal, against the death penalty,
                  for affirmative action, and pro-choice. But the conservatives
                  on this show get a bad rap. Their legal positions are misrepresented
                  to the point that they seem to ignore or wilfully misunderstand
                  the law. When Novelli and Brankin discuss the advisability of
                  issuing a stay, Brankin's opposition is political, rather than
                  legal. He suggests that no possible presentation of evidence
                  or law could result in a rehearing of the case. Therefore the
                  stay would be cruel, since it would hold out false hope. Novelli's
                  response is to ask his law clerks (Elly is the only one who does
                  any work on the case) to find him &quot;case law&quot; that would
                  allow him to issue the stay. Elly comments that the request for
                  a stay is badly drafted. What's the dramatic point? That death
                  penalty advocates are committed but incompetent?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Meanwhile, Brankin calls the
                  justices together to discuss granting cert (do they do that sua
                  sponte?). We hear various comments throughout the episode about
                  the number of justices it takes to grant cert, deny cert or obtain
                  a &quot;win&quot;: different breakdowns fly through the air with
                  law clerk assessments about how things &quot;would have turned
                  out&quot; if Novelli had been on the Court the year before. This
                  all becomes confusing and even law teachers who watched the episode
                  were left in doubt about what was actually being said. The over-emphasis
                  on and confusion over &quot;how many votes&quot; distracts us
                  from the really interesting question: how do Justices make up
                  their minds? In addition, what goes on behind the Justices' closed
                  doors in chambers is shrouded in mystery, since no one else,
                  not even a law clerk, goes in there. The scene in chambers is
                  therefore totally misleading. If the scriptwriters are trying
                  to tell us that what goes on is smoke-filled room politics, they
                  could not have been more obvious, but we have no way of knowing
                  whether they are correct. Dramatically, it would have been more
                  interesting if the discussion were not shown and Novelli had
                  to explain the results to his neophyte clerks (and us) in guarded,
                  obscure language.<br>
<br>
                  The political breakdowns are obviously more important than the
                  legal positions. Of all the impressions <i>First Monday</i> throws
                  out about the Court, this one is perhaps the most accurate. Politics
                  does matter. But does it matter to the extent that the writers
                  suggest? Do they really want to tell the American public that
                  the Brethren make up their minds about who wins and who loses
                  the way they make up their minds about what to order for dinner?
                  If so, they need better plots and better dialogue than this.
                  I'm very cynical about a lot of our legal system, but even I
                  think it's a cheap shot.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Elly eventually trots in with
                  a case; Novelli objects to it by saying it isn't factually consistent
                  with the case at bar, and also that the petitioner lost. (How
                  did this woman get a job as a law clerk, anyway?). He chastises
                  her for letting her political beliefs get in the way of her legal
                  research. Off she goes to try again, and he continues to think
                  deep thoughts in chambers. The scene of her doing research in
                  the law library is quite something. Apparently the only person
                  who knows where anything is located is the person at the desk
                  (who we are meant to assume is a librarian). She even knows where
                  specific volumes of reporters are. And she has a code of ethics.
                  When Julian (Brankin's law minion) pumps her for information
                  about Elly's research, she declines to answer. The image of the
                  librarian is accurate-they really do know a lot of stuff and
                  they keep their mouths shut. Are we going to see that developed?
                  It might make an interesting plot line at some point. Eventually
                  the great breakthrough comes, when at the end of the episode,
                  her male colleague (Jerry, the liberal, nice one) rereads the
                  trial transcript and opines that the inmate didn't intend to
                  kill his victim. Aha! Shouts Elly. New evidence! Novelli can
                  grant the stay. He does, and she tries to get through to the
                  warden in the usual cliched last-minute reprieve scene, but just
                  as it did in the beginning of the episode, lightning strikes
                  the prison, knocking out communications, and she has to give
                  up. Moses is executed. She feels really, really bad about that,
                  too.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The triumph of politics over
                  law is even uglier in the scenes involving the transsexual Mexican
                  national who wants political asylum. The petitioner sits with
                  her attorney at the defense table. While the Court provides tables
                  for attorneys, petitioners don't routinely sit with their advocates,
                  and justices don't pepper clients with questions from the bench.
                  (The closest anyone ever came to addressing the Court without
                  leave was when Larry Flynt objected to the proceedings during
                  his attorney's November 8, 1983 oral argument and Chief Justice
                  Burger ordered him arrested. Keeton v. Hustler, 104 S. Ct. 1473
                  (1984)). The questions directed at the appellant and her attorney
                  from the conservative Justices are mean-spirited and rude. Chief
                  Justice Rankin tells the petitioner if he'd just put on a pair
                  of pants his &quot;problem would be solved.&quot; Justice Hoskins
                  asks the attorney if the petitioner plans to have &quot;the operation&quot;
                  to make him female. She says she doesn't know (like Elly, yet
                  another incompetent female practicing law in the jurisdiction
                  of PopCultureLand, apparently). The client admits at that point
                  that he is really a transvestite, destroying his case. To make
                  matters worse, the attorney accepts a dinner invitation from
                  Novelli's Hispanic conservative law clerk, Miguel (at least he's
                  not named &quot;Jes&uacute;s&quot; or &quot;Juan&quot;), who
                  tells her that he likes her legs. At dinner she admits that she
                  never met her client before she took the case yesterday. They
                  go dancing, and in a plot twist one can see a mile away, she
                  reveals that she is a transsexual. So much for Miguel's (we are
                  to assume) misguided admiration of her legs. (&quot;Oh,&quot;
                  he says, &quot;that's why you wanted to lead.&quot;) Miguel is
                  apparently meant to go against type: he's anti-affirmative action
                  and pro-death penalty. He's the Clarence Thomas of Hispanic-American
                  legal circles, reminding viewers that we can't judge a book by
                  its cover or a lawyer by her figure, or a law clerk by his name.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At the end of the episode Novelli
                  calls his Chief Justice in the middle of the night to tell him
                  he plans to issue stays for all eight death row inmates convicted
                  of crimes committed while they were juveniles. The CJ is unimpressed
                  with this display of potential moral courage, and so are the
                  viewers. Moses is still really dead.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">And the language! Non-lawyers
                  will think lawyers are linguistically challenged. When examining
                  the picture of Novelli on the football team, male law clerk 1
                  (Jerry the likeable guy) says he didn't realize his new boss
                  was a jock. &quot;Look beyond the prima facie evidence,&quot;
                  Elly informs him (Novelli was the water boy). Prima facie evidence?
                  I know some pretty pretentious Ivy League law grads. Even they
                  don't talk like that.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The interactions are bizarre.
                  Newly appointed Justice Novelli's (Joe Mantegna) first meetings
                  with his fellow justices occur on his first day of service. Likely?
                  I think not. Nor do they really lobby each other on the way down
                  the hall to hear oral argument. And does the CJ joyfully shout
                  &quot;Let's make history&quot; after a football huddle, as they
                  pile onto the bench, like a high school cheerleader with delusions
                  of grandeur? And it's pretty implausible that Novelli has never
                  been to the Court before. After all, he has to move into his
                  office.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">My local newspaper ran a column
                  about the episode yesterday. The critic objected to the depiction
                  of only four law clerks, three of them working for Novelli, saying
                  that viewers might think that's all it takes to run the Court.
                  Believe me, if that was all I thought viewers would think was
                  wrong with the Court, I wouldn't worry about it. The erstwhile
                  quartet didn't bother me; in fact, I found them so annoying that
                  I don't think I could have taken more than that. &quot;Elly&quot;
                  does all the work, and all the worrying. One of the males, &quot;Jerry
                  Klein&quot;, is the pragmatic sort, very likely to do well as
                  an eventual popular and emotionally healthy partner in a major
                  law firm, probably headed for a judgeship himself one day. Third
                  up is Miguel, the conservative jackass who gets his comeuppance
                  at the end of the episode. Finally, there's the Chief Justice's
                  law clerk, a smarmy bit of work named Julian Lodge, who spies
                  on the other clerks for his master's benefit.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The one redeeming social value
                  is the acting. The wonderful Charles Durning, who has bad limericks
                  to recite, James Garner, Joe Mategna and the much underrated
                  James McEachin are among the talented bunch trapped in this mess.
                  The actor playing the condemned man does a fine job, as does
                  the one playing his prison guard, but again their dialogue is
                  familiar and thus much less touching than it should be. The young
                  death row inmate whom lightning strikes twice is named &quot;Moses&quot;-unfortunately
                  he's not leading us into any promised land that I can discern,
                  except that of certain knowledge that people in this country
                  are wrongly executed every year.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">First Monday</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> could be so much more than it is-an
                  exciting examination of ideas and social policy coupled with
                  the human interaction that we forget makes up a great part of
                  the workings of the Court. Any reporter volume is full of intriguing
                  and interesting cases that could form the basis for a fascinating
                  plot, that with effective writing and plotting would not be beyond
                  the audience's ability to comprehend.. Memo to Donald Bellisario:
                  Get in touch with me. I can help you with this.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If I talked in sports cliches,
                  I'd say <i>First Monday</i> so far has too many men on the field,
                  and ought to be penalized for late hits. Since I don't, I think
                  <i>First Monday</i> is full of (I hope) reversible errors. But
                  so far, I'd deny it cert. Without radical revision, I give this
                  series a very short Term.<br>
