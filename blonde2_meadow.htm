                  But is She As Virtuous As Mr. Smith?<br>
                  Review of <i>Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde</i></font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Carrie Menkel-Meadow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the much awaited sequel
                  to <i>Legally Blonde</i>, Elle Wood leaves her Boston law firm
                  when she learns that, like most lawyers, her law firm works hard
                  for its money and lets the clients, not moral principles, determine
                  what to work on. Having discovered her dear pet's mother is captive
                  in an animal testing laboratory for cosmetics, the much cosmeticized
                  Ms. Woods decides to go to Washington to lobby for a prevention
                  of testing on animals bill. Whether Washington DC is seen as
                  the white town of its marble monuments or the more grey town
                  of corruption, graft and logrolling, Ms. Woods approaches it
                  in her definitive pink. Rejecting one outfit as &quot;too Nancy,&quot;
                  another as &quot;too Hilary&quot; and a third as &quot;too Monica&quot;
                  (in probably the funniest lines in the movie) she settles on
                  perfect Jackie Kennedy pillbox pink, complete with hat and gloves,
                  to climb the dark suit laden steps of the Capitol and fight for
                  her law.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/blonde1.jpg" width="205" height="141" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">When last I wrote a review of
                  <i>Legally Blonde 1</i>, I wrote as a former citizen of LA and
                  Boston to rave about how that movie required &quot;east&quot;
                  to confront its bigoted view of &quot;west,&quot; dumb blonds
                  and women's epistemology (that's an academic's way of saying
                  knowledge about fabric, make-up and beauty tips). This time I
                  write as a citizen of Washington to complain that while this
                  second movie sought to do the same thing - endear us to Elle
                  Wood's more authentic 'women's ways of knowing,&quot; -- it ultimately
                  fails, not for all the reasons the movie critics have complained
                  about - bad jokes, an even more dumbed down Elle, but because
                  Elle's eventually successful modus operandi is no better than
                  the &quot;corrupt&quot; Washington &quot;bill becomes a law&quot;
                  story she is supposed to supplant, or &quot;rupture&quot; in
                  critical terms. <br>
<br>
                  The film pays its obvious homage to <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i>,
                  replicating some of its scenes (the Lincoln Memorial for inspiration,
                  the spirited speech to the Congressional floor) and in case you
                  are a young viewer and have never seen the original, a cut of
                  the original Jimmy Stewart film is on full display.<br>
<br>
                  But, what should and could have been a similar turn on the ways
                  things are usually done (the trial scene in <i>Legally Blonde
                  1</i>), this film merely substitutes Elle's networking her former
                  Delta Nu sorority sisters (while she claims to be &quot;going
                  to the people&quot;) for the way present-day legislators drum
                  up support from their own &quot;fraternity&quot; of contributors,
                  interest groups and golf and restaurant buddies. Elle's supposedly
                  more &quot;principled&quot; stance against her boss, fellow Delta
                  Nu and Harvard Law Graduate, (but needing to be re-elected from
                  the contributions of a cosmetics manufacturer), Congresswoman
                  Victoria Rudd (played by Sally Field, failed TV Supreme Court
                  justice) is really no more than business as usual for Washington
                  lobbying. (Did screenwriters who haven't spent enough time in
                  this venerable capital, really not have enough of an imagination
                  to come up with a story line that would in fact have made Elle's
                  victory more principled or democratic (or at least based on more
                  accurate Congressional bill-making rules)? <br>
<br>
                  With the help of her own Washington insider, Wellington (read
                  Watergate) doorman, Sid Post (a waste of Bob Newhardt talent),
                  Elle networks her friends who organize a &quot;Million Dog March,&quot;
                  as she trades on personal relationships to secure the support
                  of foes (Committee Chairs and conservative Republicans) by calling
                  on Delta Nu handshakes, the services of her loyal hairdresser
                  friend, dispensing services (probably unlawfully under Congressional
                  lobbying rules) and even puppy love (even if politically correct
                  gay puppy love). Even her ambitious rival in the Congresswoman's
                  office eventually helps her with blackmail (and Elle does nothing
                  to stop it), as Congresswoman Rudd casts the final vote to support
                  Elle's bill against her own contributors' will, even if only
                  because her aide has her on tape acknowledging her own dishonesty.
                  Is Elle any better than the lawyers at the Boston law firm she
                  left? Means justify the ends....zealous advocacy.....anything
                  to win......passion for the client's cause - you take your pick.
                  She may believe in her mission, but her tactics and behaviors
                  are lawyering and lobbying as usual.<br>
<br>
                  This is not Mr. Smith Came to Washington. If Jimmy Stewart, like
                  Reece Witherspoon, was naive when he stepped onto the Congressional
                  set, his film is about the real triumph of truth, democracy and
                  all those myths we Americans like to believe in. Elle Wood has
                  merely shown us how Washington lobbying can be twisted, like
                  hair on a roller, to new kinds of curls when the &quot;rollers
                  and shakers&quot; change from male to female. Is this what we
                  should be applauding? Substitution of a &quot;new girls network&quot;
                  for the &quot;old boys network&quot;? I don't think so. And,
                  should &quot;the people&quot; and Congressional representatives
                  be exhorted to act because they are all &quot;beautiful&quot;?
                  I don't think that either. Even a simple, &quot;because you care&quot;
                  would have been better (and sufficiently &quot;pink&quot;!).<br>
<br>
                  While this movie took on an important new legal subject, the
                  making of law (or as we say here in DCB the making of sausage),
                  it really didn't have the critical bite of its predecessor. Although
                  we want to both laugh at and admire Elle Wood's perseverance,
                  spirit and her blending of &quot;natural beauty&quot; knowledge
                  with her rigorous Harvard Law education, this film offers us
                  an Elle who looks a whole lot like those drab guys (and girls)
                  in suits who make deals on the streets and in the restaurants
                  near my office, even if she does it in flashier colors and with
                  more &quot;face-time.&quot;<br>
<br>
                  Lest I sound too much like a dispirited and cynical observer
                  of the Washington political process and its simplistic Hollywood
                  depiction here, I do want to single out a few nice touches. Elle
                  brings her sorority's ritual of the &quot;snap cup,&quot; in
                  which members of a group write down something nice about their
                  fellow group members to be read out and be &quot;snapped&quot;
                  for approval, to her Congressional office. Now, imagine a Washington
                  political (and journalistic?) process in which people actually
                  said nice things about each other, rather than bad B that would
                  be a creative (and fictitious) movie. (Actually, some people
                  in my field (conflict resolution facilitation) tried that for
                  several years with &quot;harmony retreats&quot; for Congressional
                  representatives in Hershey, Pennsylvania, to try to modify some
                  of the overly confrontational behavior of our warring two party
                  system. At this writing, it doesn't seem to be working). Also,
                  imagine the delight of the screenwriters that this film, preaching
                  the progressive values of gay puppy love, should presciently
                  be released just as Lawrence v. Texas was decided (striking down
                  Texas' sodomy laws). Sometimes fact and fiction come together.
                  If Elle Wood could get a conservative Republican to accept his
                  gay dog and Justice Kennedy could come to accept his gay fellow
                  citizens, then maybe we can use animals and Elle's personal relationships
                  to dramatize a few other important human causes that need legal
                  action (curtailment of civil liberties, spouse and woman abuse,
                  family poverty, just to name a few....)<br>
<br>
                  Well, as this movie ended Elle had her eyes set on the White
                  House so I hope that if there is going to be a <i>Legally Blonde
                  3</i>, ( &quot;Blonde Ambition&quot; anyone?), the writers will
                  give us a better chance to use Elle's authenticity (I can't believe
                  I am saying that about a &quot;made-up&quot; girl) to right a
                  few wrongs when she turns the White House Pink.</font></p>
