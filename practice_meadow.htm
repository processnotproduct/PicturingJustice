                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
                  The first episode of the 2001 television season for <i>The Practice
                  (The Candidate</i>, September 23, 2001) was a veritable issue-spotter
                  of legal ethics. Improbable and as badly decided as some of the
                  ethical choices were, Ellenor, Helen, Jimmy and new prosecutor
                  Alan Low, gave us a two-hour whirlwind tour through the complexities
                  of legal ethics. The ethics issues are especially difficult when
                  the context is murder, the client is both a state senator and
                  a childhood friend (of Ellenor's), and the prosecutor and the
                  defending attorney are roommates. <br>
<br>
                  This season opener, a two-hour special episode that will continue
                  into the next week of the season, promises that <i>The Practice</i>
                  will continue to be a legal ethics teacher's delight (if not
                  for the pleasantness of the stories, but for the instructional
                  possibilities). Lawyers, law students and law professors alike
                  should watch each episode of <i>The Practice</i> with either
                  the Model Rules of Professional Conduct or a pen and paper in
                  hand, to jot down the many legal ethics issues dramatized and
                  to test one's own knowledge of the right answer under the rules,
                  if not the right answer of morality or advocacy.<br>
<br>
                  While I acknowledge my perhaps warped reviewer's eye as a legal
                  ethicist, <i>The Practice</i> season opener was carried for me
                  by the ethical dilemmas, if not by the obvious take-off of the
                  Gary Condit affair. (Indeed, this cynical Washington-scandal
                  watcher guessed the surprising denouement to the plot within
                  the first 15 minutes of air time.)<br>
<br>
                  Ellenor is called to the home of State Senator Keith Ellison
                  (who by the way was a brilliant casting choice as an immediate
                  Gary Condit look-alike, just in case any viewer missed the source
                  of the tale) whom the TV viewer first sees in his skivvies, as
                  his wife showers and his daughter throws up after we all view
                  the bloody body of a nude man in the Ellison marital bed. Ellenor
                  is called before the police are, the bloody clothes are in the
                  washing machine and all have showered and composed themselves
                  before the police finally come (at least 10 minutes after Ellenor's
                  arrival and first strategy is planned). Is this unethical? Absolutely!
                  Ellenor has tampered with or advised tampering with evidence
                  at a crime scene and obstructed justice. <br>
<br>
                  Clients Keith Ellison and his wife Marsha and daughter Allison
                  are clearly up to something together. Can Ellenor represent them
                  all? Not in any criminal court of which I am aware in real life.
                  The conflicts are so obvious, especially when Ellenor is informed
                  she will not be told any of the story by the client(s) because
                  Keith doesn't want to tell you anything that would prevent you
                  from representing me. That's because she is in the great criminal
                  law firm of Bobby Donnell et al. Plan B, perjured testimony,
                  or something more sinister may be necessary for this candidate's
                  defense. If this doesn't alert an otherwise clever defense lawyer,
                  I don't know what would. But David E. Kelley likes to move those
                  dramatic plots along, so having the judge later threaten to deal
                  with the conflict but not doing so (as most any real judge would
                  in such a case) is supposed to satisfy us lawyer-watchers that
                  Kelley at least knows he is portraying something problematic.<br>
<br>
                  Just to even up the ethical score, Ellenor's roommate, the steely
                  prosecutor Helen Gamble, is up to her own ethical high jinks.
                  Calling wife Marsha a material witness (a little scary that Kelley
                  would be so prescient about how much the public would know about
                  material witnesses at air time, one week after the horrific September
                  11 terrorist attacks), Helen has a body cavity search done on
                  Marsha (no self-incrimination, of course, under current search
                  law) in quest of the telltale sperm to prove the wife's affair
                  and give a motive to Senator Ellison for a murder. (Nice twist
                  on the Condit rumors, yes?) Alas, Helen then violates the clearest
                  ethical rule known to prosecutors, as she talks directly to a
                  represented party (wife Marsha) (Model Rule 4.2 for those of
                  you who want chapter and verse). <br>
<br>
                  She then proceeds to do even worse, by giving advice to said
                  represented party B and absolutely wrong advice at that: Your
                  silence could incriminate you. Now, how is the public supposed
                  to learn about the 5th and 6th amendments with such bad information?
                  Our knowledgeable wronged party (Marsha) cites the right amendments
                  so you would think Helen would get a bit nervous now that she
                  might be in trouble beyond being sued for misconduct. Helen can't
                  get sued for misconduct, but she can be disciplined by the Bar
                  or lose her job. Indeed, in this case her behavior is so egregious
                  any normal criminal judge, not to mention her own superiors,
                  would have ordered her off the case. <br>
<br>
                  Helen, who each year is more experienced, seems increasingly
                  desperate to win at all costs and frequently becomes emotionally
                  involved in her cases. Her flouting of ethics rules is getting
                  so brazen, at least this viewer is finding them increasingly
                  hard to believe. Helen is too smart for all this -- and she loves
                  her job too much to risk it so often just to move the plot to
                  its dramatic fights between her and the Donnell team. (She is
                  now joined by a more good-looking sidekick, Alan Low, than last
                  season's killed-off Richard Bey. Please Hollywood, do so many
                  of the lawyers have to be mindless beauties? Richard seemed endearingly
                  real.)<br>
<br>
                  On it goes, in the now formulaic trial scenes of fights and arguments
                  between Helen and Alan and Bobby, Jimmy and Ellenor (only Hollywood
                  would permit so many lawyers on each side of a case with so few
                  real witnesses and none of them difficult experts to manage.)
                  Daughter Allison Ellison is questioned in a strange combination
                  of criminal interview and civil deposition with lawyers advising
                  her what not to say (the same lawyers representing her parents)
                  while Helen objects, as if a client or witness can't talk to
                  a lawyer before talking to the prosecutor (what is this, English
                  procedure?). Both sides try the case in the press (credits to
                  Chandra Levy's parents and demerits to both sets of lawyers who
                  repeatedly violate Rule 3.6) and the charming politician-defendant
                  continues to believe he can sway a jury as he has seduced his
                  constituency. (Turns out that's not all he's seducing! Surprise,
                  surprise!). His claim is that he shot an intruder, not an adulterer.
                  (Interestingly, the show might have explored the vagaries of
                  justified homicide when husbands shoot the men having affairs
                  with their wives -- long a legal practice in many states --that
                  might have made a more interesting defense argument).<br>
<br>
                  In case any viewer missed the obvious Condit allusions, the key
                  witness turns out to be a Ms. Levy, an employee of the murdered
                  victim, who provides the wrongly admitted speculative evidence
                  that she thought something fishy was going on between the murder
                  victim and Mrs. Ellison. And sadly, Jimmy commits yet another
                  act of both legal malpractice and ethical violations of incompetence,
                  when he incompletely interviews Ms. Levy and is therefore shocked
                  to learn the answer to a question he didn't know the answer to
                  (because he didn't ask it).....<br>
<br>
                  Stay tuned for next week's effort to free the innocent Senator.
                  Not only is he in fact innocent, but if this isn't ineffective
                  assistance of counsel, I don't know what is. Of course, Ellenor
                  will be hampered by the fact that she learned the real story
                  from a privileged client contact. Although everyone is upset
                  with Jimmy's malpractice, sage Bobby chastises his firmmates,
                  not to do better, but never to criticize another law firm member
                  in front of the client (think about the possible malpractice
                  claims!).<br>
<br>
                  The surprising testimony of Ms. Levy shocks the judge into thinking
                  our favorite defenders are up to another of their now-familiar
                  stunts and he threatens to take their bar cards. Dramatic for
                  the audience, and thanks Mr. Kelley for letting the public know
                  that judges do care about lawyers' ethics, but this wouldn't
                  be the way it happens as the writers of <i>The Practice</i> well
                  know from past shows. Disciplinary matters are handled in separate
                  administrative proceedings before a different tribunal and not
                  in the case at issue. <br>
<br>
                  Oh, well, I don't want to complain too much. Though the plot
                  was obvious to this viewer (but I suspect was experienced by
                  most lay viewers as a total surprise, as intended), and the scripts
                  are getting a bit formulaic (what lawyer TV show isn't?), <i>The
                  Practice</i> continues to be the single best vehicle I know for
                  teaching about legal ethics and motivating law student viewers
                  to see the context and consequences of choices made by lawyers
                  in practice as they steer between the rocks and hard places of
                  good advocacy and the requirements of good ethics. I look forward
                  to a season full of more ethical issue spotters, even if the
                  stories ripped from the headlines (sorry, <i>Law and Order</i>)
                  are themselves all too familiar.</font></p>
