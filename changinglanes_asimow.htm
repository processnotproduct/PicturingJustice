                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In an observation that stuck
                  with me, one of the Yippies (perhaps Jerry Rubin) remarked that
                  the courts are the toilets of America. In the movies, big law
                  firms are the toilets of the law. <i>Changing Lanes</i> is only
                  the latest in a long line of movies that ascribe every sort of
                  personal and professional evil to big firms and the lawyers that
                  profit from them.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/changinglanes1.jpg" width="186" height="126" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">In
                  a recent article, I discussed the history of law firms in the
                  movies. Beginning with the small firms trashed in such films
                  as Orson Welles' <i>The Lady From Shanghai</i>, filmmakers have
                  seldom deviated from portraying law firms as profoundly wicked.
                  (Michael Asimow, <i>Embodiment of Evil: Law Firms in the Movies</i>,
                  48 UCLA Law Review 1339). Since <i>The Verdict</i> in 1982, a
                  line of films including (but not limited to) <i>The Firm, Philadelphia,
                  Class Action, Regarding Henry, Liar Liar, The Rainmaker, From
                  the Hip, A Civil Action, and Devil's Advocate</i> represent law
                  firms and big firm lawyers as personally repulsive, greedy, unethical,
                  and utterly without any redeeming social value. Solo lawyers
                  in the movies of the last two decades are pretty bad, but lawyers
                  in law firms are truly the pits. (John Grisham's mega-best selling
                  books make the same point--law firms are always arch-villains
                  in Grisham's books).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The venomously negative portrayal
                  of law firms in the movies is no accident. For more than thirty
                  years, the Harris poll has sought information about the public
                  approval of the leadership of various institutions. These polls
                  show that the leadership of law firms is the most distrusted
                  institution in America. They are at the very bottom of the list,
                  easily topped by such normally suspect institutions as the leadership
                  of labor unions, big business, the federal government, or the
                  military. Indeed, Harris remarked that the 1997 numbers for law
                  firms were the lowest number recorded for any institution over
                  the thirty-year period of the poll. Popular culture always reflects
                  the general attitudes of society, and the public's intense distaste
                  for law firms is accurately reflected in film. Indeed, <i>Changing
                  Lanes</i> is one of the most effective anti-big firm movie ever
                  made.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the film, Gavin Banek (Ben
                  Affleck) is a junior partner at a big Manhattan firm and son-in-law
                  of senior partner Stephen Delano (Sydney Pollack). One morning,
                  Banek has a minor traffic accident with Doyle Gipson (Samuel
                  L. Jackson). Both men were rushing to court--Banek to litigate
                  an issue critical to his law firm about a charitable trust, Gipson
                  to represent himself in a child custody proceeding that threatens
                  to strip him of joint custody of his kids.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Banek acts like a total jerk,
                  leaving Gipson stranded on the highway, but Banek also accidentally
                  drops a critical document that Gipson picks up. The accident
                  has some very negative consequences for both men and it touches
                  off a cycle of revenge moves by each of them that make the situation
                  much worse. While this drama could have been trite, violent and
                  wholly formulaic, in fact it isn't; the script and direction
                  are excellent and the actors (particularly Pollack--who directed
                  <i>The Firm</i>!) are outstanding. The film overall is quite
                  good--which is why its portrayal of the law firm is so deadly.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">What do we learn about law
                  firms from this film? Well, first, both Banek and Delano are
                  cheating on their wives. The wives know all about it but continue
                  their marriages because they like the money and status. To get
                  even with Gipson, who spitefully won't return the document, Banek
                  hires a computer hacker to ruin Gipson's credit by entering a
                  false bankruptcy onto the records. Later he visits the school
                  where Gipson's children go and tells them that Gipson plans to
                  kidnap his kids. That's the kind of people that work at big law
                  firms. (Granted, Gipson is doing some pretty bad things to Banek
                  too.)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The issue that Banek was litigating
                  concerned a power of appointment issued by Dunn, a wealthy man
                  who is now dead. The power stripped control over a large charitable
                  trust (benefiting the children of New York) from its previous
                  board of directors and transferred it to Delano's law firm. Dunn's
                  granddaughter, on behalf of the prior board, is challenging the
                  power of appointment. In fact, the power of appointment was procured
                  by Banek when Dunn was clearly incompetent; Dunn had no idea
                  what he was signing. Since then, Delano and his partners have
                  looted millions of dollars from the trust. Banek lost the original
                  power of appointment at the traffic accident and the judge makes
                  it clear that without the original document, she will rule against
                  Delano's firm.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Hey, no problem. After Delano
                  finishes his temper tantrum, another partner suggests a way out.
                  They can use Dunn's original signature from another document
                  and submit a forged power of appointment to the court. When Banek
                  balks at this, his wife pleads with him to go along with the
                  fraud. She observes that their life style rests entirely on Banek's
                  status at the firm, which will be severely jeopardized if the
                  Dunn trust case is lost because of his carelessness. So, in short,
                  we learn that big-firm lawyers cheat their way into power, enrich
                  themselves by stealing money from kids, and engage in criminal
                  forgery to cover up their wrongdoing. Their offices are gorgeously
                  decorated, but they are deeply and irredeemably corrupt.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In a beautifully written scene
                  near the end of the film, Banek interviews an idealistic young
                  law school grad who wants to work for the firm. The applicant
                  talks about the grandeur of the law. Banek hires the guy, but
                  tells him that he'll be revising his opinion about the law pretty
                  quickly. Maybe in about an hour. In another scene, Delano agrees
                  that the firm makes money from stealing and fraud, but it also
                  does pro bono work in death penalty cases; hopefully, he says,
                  the good they do outweighs the bad. But we know it doesn't come
                  close.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Changing Lanes</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is a much more effective hit piece
                  against law firms than films like <i>The Firm</i> or <i>The Devil's
                  Advocate</i>. <i>The Firm</i> involved an apparently respectable
                  law firm that fronted for the Mafia and killed any lawyers who
                  wanted to leave. In <i>The Devil's Advocate</i>, the managing
                  partner of a big firm was Satan himself and the other lawyers
                  were demons from hell. <i>Liar Liar</i> and <i>From the Hip</i>
                  involved law firm partners that were clowns and buffoons. Nobody
                  could take any of this seriously. But <i>Changing Lanes</i> seems
                  very real when it describes law firm misdeeds; the great acting
                  really puts the point across. The law office scenes resonate
                  beautifully. I rank <i>Changing Lanes</i> right up there with
                  David Mamet's brilliant script in <i>The Verdict</i>, in which
                  Ed Concannon's firm resorts to every filthy trick in the book
                  to derail Frank Galvin's medical malpractice suit. Concannon
                  (James Mason) justifies it by saying that he gets paid all that
                  money not to do his best, but to win.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">We can always learn a lot about
                  the public's attitudes and beliefs by studying popular culture.
                  The public dislikes lawyers but it detests big law firms. Films
                  like <i>Changing Lanes</i> accurately reflect that view and may
                  well intensify it. Law firms have a long, long way to go to rebuild
                  their image in the eyes of the public.</font></p>
