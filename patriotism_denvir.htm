            <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Patriotism</font></b><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> by John Denvir</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Over 3000 people died in the
            World Trade Center attacks. The victims were as blameless as
            you or I. So it is natural that we ask that the terrorists who
            planned the attacks be punished and that all necessary steps
            be taken to prevent other such heinous crimes.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Our leaders tell us what steps
            are necessary in this new &quot;war against terrorism.&quot;
            Some of the new weapons seem to contradict just those principles
            we see America as representing. We are told that suspected aliens
            are to be tried by military courts without normal due process
            guarantees, that lawyer-client conversations are subject to government
            eavesdropping, that over a thousand aliens are being held incommunicado
            in government prisons, and that thousands of muslim students
            are to be required to submit to questioning by government agents.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The President and the Attorney
            General tell us that in this time of national emergency patriotism
            requires that we trust the government not to abuse its powers.
            But a fresh viewing of Ingmar Bergman's <i>The Serpent's Egg</i>
            convinces me that patriotism counsels just the opposite course
            of action. Suspicion, not docility, is the proper response.</font></p>

            <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Serpent's Egg</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is set in Germany in 1923, a time
            of runaway inflation, extremist politics of left and right, and
            a growing anti-Semitism stirred by the nascent Nazi movement.
            The plot concerns two unemployed circus performers who are stranded
            in Berlin without means of support. They face their predicament
            with completely different attitudes. One, Manuela (Liv Ullman),
            constantly displays a trusting, positive attitude. She never
            loses faith that things will get better, and when they don't
            she's likely to blame herself instead of others. Manuela is a
            very likeable person. Her brother-in-law Abel (David Carradine)
            is anything but likeable. He's suspicious, self-pitying, ungrateful
            to those who try to help, and prone to sudden bouts of violence.
            Abel repels us just as much as Manuela attracts us.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Yet Abel's paranoia serves
            him better than Manuela's trust does her. Her docility prepares
            her for the role of victim in a Nazi plot which Abel's suspicious
            nature enables him to uncover and escape.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I draw from this the moral
            that sometimes trust is not a virtue. Paradoxically, it is in
            times of national emergency that suspicion of government is most
            necessary. It's then that the temptation to sacrifice our democratic
            liberties on the altar of national security is most strong. The
            patriotic citizen, especially the patriotic lawyer, has a duty
            to demand that the government make its case whenever it proposes
            a curtailment of civil liberties.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">What sort of suspicions should
            we harbor about the use of military tribunals? The government
            tells us that they are necessary to prevent the disclosure of
            national security secrets, but that seems a specious argument
            in light of the fact that we already have laws in effect that
            protect such secrets in federal courts. Why would the government
            still want military tribunals? Maybe they know that federal courts
            will not accept hearsay evidence and would reject confessions
            where detainees have been subjected to torture or degrading treatment
            such as long periods of sleep deprivation. There is no proof
            that the government is using improper tactics; we have no information
            on how these detainees are being treated because they have not
            been allowed access to lawyers. But we do know that our closest
            allies, Britain and Israel, have used such tactics against suspected
            terrorists.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There is also something very
            troubling about rounding up tens of thousands of Arab students
            for questioning. Not only is there the haunting memory of the
            World War II incarceration of Japanese-American citizens, but
            also the lack of any proven connection between these students
            and the September 11 attacks. One suspects that the government
            might use small student visa violations unrelated to terrorism
            as levers to force Arab students to spy on legal groups which
            oppose American policy. This was a favorite tactic of the communist
            secret police in East and Europe during the Cold War. And, unfortunately,
            we also have a history of unlawful subversion by the FBI of lawful
            groups like Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership
            Conference.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Maybe I am being a little paranoid;
            perhaps we can trust John Ashcroft to go no farther than absolutely
            necessary in the curtailment of democratic liberties. I hope
            so. But until we know exactly what the government is doing, my
            take is that the patriotic stance demands that we ask questions
            and demand evidence. Docility is not a democratic virtue, nor
            is suspicion of government a democratic vice.</font></p>
