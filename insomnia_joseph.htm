                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Paul R Joseph</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">CAUTION: CONTAINS &quot;SPOILERS&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By the time legendary detective
                  Will Dormer (Al Pacino) arrives in a backwater Alaska town to
                  investigate a murder that has stumped the local talent, he is
                  already doomed. Internal Affairs in his hometown, Los Angeles,
                  is sniffing close to his secret, that he planted evidence to
                  gain the conviction of an alleged murderer. His partner, Hap
                  (Martin Donovan) is about to cut a deal and spill his guts. It
                  will all come out and Dormer's legacy, the evil criminals he
                  has sent to jail, will be lost-the filthy scum will likely be
                  released. When Dormer accidently shoots his partner in the Alaskan
                  fog, witnessed only by the murderer he is trying to identify
                  and bring to justice (author Walter Finch, played with understated
                  calm evil by Robin Williams), Dormer is locked into a sleazy
                  dance of deception and cover-up which exposes the price of the
                  initial evil and leads to Dormer's eventual death. By the time
                  he cautions straight-arrow Alaskan cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank)
                  not to lose her own way as he has lost his, morality triumphs.
                  Or does it?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In order for <i>Insomnia</i>
                  to work, Pacino's Will Dormer must be a believable and a sympathetic
                  character. He is both-and perhaps too much so.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/insomnia.jpg" width="189" height="125" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">To
                  be believable, we must accept that Dormer, who is revered in
                  police circles, whose cases are studied and whose words are memorized
                  by worshipful Alaskan cop Ellie Burr, is also a law-breaker who
                  planted evidence to obtain a conviction. We believe. A combination
                  of real-life events and media popular culture make this leap
                  no problem at all. The Ramparts Scandal in Los Angeles and the
                  lingering doubt about the blood samples in the O.J. trial remind
                  us that cops don't only get it wrong, sometimes they make it
                  up. Popular culture responds with <i>N.Y.P.D. Blue</i>'s Officer
                  Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz), a cop very willing to use force-and
                  who knows what else?--to get to what he understands to be the
                  right outcome.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As believable as Dormer is,
                  he is also sympathetic and the only clear voice in the film.
                  Like Sipowicz, we know that Dormer is not a bad cop. In fact,
                  he is a very good one. The people he arrests are guilty and he
                  sees what most others do not. Yes, he planted evidence, but it
                  was in a case where the evidence of guilt was clear to him (but
                  might not be to a jury). Nowhere in <i>Insomnia</i> is there
                  a hint that the defendant was innocent. The jailed criminals
                  who might &quot;walk&quot; if Internal Affairs brings Dormer
                  down are guilty, too. Do we want the evil criminals to walk free?
                  Not really.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Dormer argues, with all the
                  power that Al Pacino can bring to a character, that the end justifies
                  the means. If a little blood must be planted to bring to justice
                  an evil child murderer, it's worth the price, says Dormer. Perhaps,
                  in a different context, the argument would be that if a little
                  torture has to be used to catch a terrorist . . .</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Internal Affairs is that department
                  which is charged with investigating police wrong-doing and law-breaking.
                  They are the cops who protect us from the cops. They ought to
                  be our heroes, but they are not. Pacino's Dormer saves his greatest
                  contempt for the Internal Affairs officers who are on his trail.
                  To him they are cops who aren't on the streets, aren't facing
                  the dangers and aren't protecting the public. They are the cops
                  who don't have the stomach for the job real cops do. Dormer makes
                  this case several times in long and impassioned soliloquies.
                  There is not much presented to dispute him. The Internal Affairs
                  cop appears only by telephone from L.A. and comes across as unlikable,
                  a tormentor seemingly more concerned with self- promotion than
                  morality and justice. He's a weak voice compared to Dormer's
                  eloquent, angry street-wise outbursts.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The arguments against Dormer's
                  position are presented non-verbally: first through the dedicated
                  professionalism of Ellie Burr; second, through Dormer's own self-torment
                  and his progressive breakdown, as sleeplessness and guilt swirl
                  together; third, by the sleazy bargain between cop and criminal
                  to preserve Dormer's secret; and, finally, by the fact that it
                  all leads to Dormer's destruction and his one-line plea to Ellie.
                  But is this enough to make the case for good or is it all susceptible
                  to another more subversive explanation?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Obviously, it's Dormer's prior
                  misdeed that leads to his partner's death and to his own; or
                  is it? Causation being the slippery little devil that it is,
                  could it not be argued that without the intervention of Internal
                  Affairs, Hap would not have been about to turn State's evidence
                  and Dormer would have been able to admit his accidental shooting
                  of his partner? There would have been no need to do anything
                  but arrest Walter Finch. The events leading to Dormer's death
                  would themselves never have taken that path and Dormer would
                  be putting more evil-doers away on the streets of Los Angeles.
                  Is the real wrong his law-breaking or is it the fact that we
                  wouldn't turn a blind eye to it? Despite everything, it's for
                  Dormer that we feel emotion, not the off-camera one-dimensional
                  Internal Affairs pursuer.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Dormer changes his view only
                  at the moment of his death, cautioning Ellie not to lose her
                  way, not to throw away a shell casing that will bring the true
                  story out. Perhaps she shouldn't toss it because even such a
                  small act would lead her inexorably to her doom just as Dormer
                  has been led to his. Yet, it could be argued that by that point
                  both Finch and Dormer were or shortly would be dead and the only
                  result of Ellie's moral rectitude, aside from possibly saving
                  her soul and integrity, would be to open up exactly the parade
                  of horribles-masses of criminals going free to prey on society-that
                  Dormer has railed against throughout the film. Perhaps it could
                  be argued that Ellie's inner peace isn't worth our safety. At
                  least, an audience might come to that conclusion.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This isn't what the film explicitly
                  presents to us, but the elements of this counter-analysis are
                  there-lurking just out of reach. Is the quiet professionalism
                  of Ellie Burr enough to convince us that the bad guys can be
                  brought to justice without breaking the rules? Is the destruction
                  of Will Dormer enough to convince us that our law enforcers must
                  avoid the lawbreakers' road? Possibly, but <i>Insomnia</i> leaves
                  room for doubt and for much soul-searching late at night when
                  it's impossible to sleep. <br>
