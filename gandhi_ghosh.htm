<br>
                  South Africa. 1893. A year after Homer Plessy boarded a first
                  class coach in Louisiana, a newly minted barrister is riding
                  first class to Pretoria. A white passenger sees him and runs
                  to get a ticket collector. A black porter advises the passenger
                  if he has ever been in South Africa before. We are informed that
                  this is the first trip. The collector arrives with the irate
                  passenger and asks how a coolie got a first class ticket. &quot;I
                  am an attorney and I purchased the ticket through the post,&quot;
                  the seated barrister responds. The porter becomes nervous as
                  the passenger and collector grow irate. &quot;There are no colored
                  attorneys in South Africa,&quot; the passenger curtly states.
                  A lawerly syllogism follows: &quot;Sir, I recently entered the
                  bar in London and since in your eyes I am colored, that proves
                  that there is a colored attorney in South Africa.&quot; The barrister,
                  bags, and all, is shown being thrown off the train in the next
                  scene.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/gandhi.jpg" width="150" height="205" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Richard
                  Attenbororugh's film epic <i>Gandhi</i> begins with a depiction
                  of the assassination of the hero. The train scene is the second
                  one, a flashback to the beginning of the public life of Mohandas
                  Karamchand Gandhi (whose name literally translates from the Gujarati
                  to &quot;Action-slave Fascination-Moon Grocer&quot;), also known
                  as the Mahatma (or Great Spirit). The movie depicts in a cursory,
                  yet dramatically compelling way, the major events of Gandhi's
                  life and more importantly the critical historical events in Indian
                  history from World War One to Independence in 1947. Some of Gandhi's
                  contradictions come through Attenborough's glass darkly: his
                  autocratic manner and his holiness, his mysticism and his practicality,
                  his public devotion and his narcissism. Other sources, particularly
                  Stanley Wolpert's 2001 biography of Gandhi, Gandhi's Passion,
                  and Shyam Benegal's 1998 film <i>The Making of the Mahatma</i>,
                  have more depth and insight. I talk about Attenborough's film
                  here for one simple reason. I was asked to write about Asian
                  and Asian American lawyers in the movies and the Gandhi was the
                  only serious candidate I could find.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Maybe I missed something while
                  strolling down the aisles of Blockbuster or Buffalo's great Mondo
                  Video or surfing the various film web sites. Maybe my colleagues
                  missed something when I asked them for examples of Asian lawyers
                  in the film. All they could find was a cameo of Whoopi Goldberg's
                  lawyer in Boys on the Side and Hunter Thompson's Samoan paladin
                  in <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>. The small screen offers
                  Lucy Liu as the dragon queen on <i>Ally McBeal</i>. Asian lawyers
                  are sight gags, much like Arche Bunker's reference to the only
                  law firm in Queens he trusts, Rabinowitz, Rabinowitz, &amp; Rabinowitz.
                  You can always count on a Jew lawyer for results; you can count
                  on an Asian lawyer for laughs. With this raw material to work
                  with, I really had only one choice in writing about Asian lawyers
                  in film.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The irony is that Gandhi by
                  his own admission was a terrible attorney. He hated public speaking
                  and was not very good at court appearances, as his Autobiography
                  more than once attests. He did show a knack for negotiation,
                  and he was able in several instances to bring difficult disputes
                  to settlement. As a leader in the independence movement, Gandhi's
                  skills (and weaknesses) as a negotiator were clearly on display.
                  Attenborough depicts these all well, but once again people serious
                  about understanding Gandhi are referred to the Wolpert book and
                  the Benegal film. I would argue that Gandhian style politics
                  and negotiation represent the worst of the politics of the personal
                  and the narcissism of piety. Gandhi would be appalled by how
                  the current Indian government uses his iconography to support
                  an aggressively capitalist and anti-Muslim agenda. The man's
                  virtues were his universalism and his attempts to unify, even
                  at the expense of repressing the expression of legitimate political,
                  economic, and social interests (as with his disasterous treatment
                  of the Muslim League that led to the bloodbath that was partition
                  and with his unwillingness to grant concessions to the Untouchables
                  whom Gandhi felt should recognize and accept their lot in the
                  social order). But given Gandhi's style, the current state of
                  Gandhi iconography was inevitable. For Gandhi, politics was personal
                  and that meant the requirement that followers had to embrace
                  an alignment, however dangerous, between the interests of a developing
                  nation and the wants of a Great Spirit. As the poet Sarojini
                  Naidu famously quipped, it cost the nation of India a fortune
                  to keep Gandhi in poverty.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But to focus on the negative,
                  ideas that have been explored in other fora, would miss the lessons
                  of Gandhi's life, all of which is so exquisitely captured in
                  the train sequence in Attenborough's film. The echo of Homer
                  Plessy's ride should resonate with lawyers, if not with the average
                  film goer. When the film came out in 1982, some members of the
                  audience would have seen the parallels with the sit-ins of the
                  1950's and 1960's but even then I am afraid that those connections
                  were already fading from the nation's memory. Plessy's ride lead
                  to a law suit that resulted in a devastating decision that sparked
                  legal battles and debates that continue today . Now seats in
                  a university classroom rather than on a first class rail coach
                  are at issue. Gandhi's ride sparked a man to think about how
                  to deal with oppressive power. The scene on the train is quintessential
                  Gandhian politics. Gandhi is seated throughout the scene, his
                  audience is standing. The audience consists of three types: the
                  angry white passenger, the oppressed black porter, and the ticket
                  collector representing the force of the state. Gandhi is outnumbered
                  but he relies on his strength to shock the audience into response.
                  No one expects a colored attorney; no one expects that he could
                  have simply purchased a ticket through the mail. And no one expects
                  the syllogism. But it is the syllogism that fails. A newly minted
                  barrister has to try out his recently acquired legal reasoning.
                  And it is the legal logic that fails in front of law's violence.
                  The rest of the film, the rest of Gandhi's career is about discovering
                  the true life of the law, the life that was turned into a cruel
                  instrument of oppression by the use of violence.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It should not be surprising
                  to point out that the train scene did not really happen. At least
                  there is no mention of the scene with its details in Gandhi's
                  Autobiography. Gandhi does discuss being denied a seat on a train
                  because of his color. He does mention an instance when he was
                  riding first class and the collector attempts to throw him off.
                  But in that incident, a fellow passenger said he did not mind
                  having a colored person on the train, and the collector ignored
                  the violation. Gandhi's experiences on the South African rails
                  sparked what is known as the South Africa campaign, one that
                  lasted until 1915 when Gandhi returned to India permanently.
                  Initially Gandhi came to South Africa to assist a law firm in
                  the settlement of a commercial dispute. Once that problem had
                  been resolved, Gandhi turned his energies to challenging the
                  South African government's treatment of Indians, largely Muslims,
                  both under the system of social apartheid and under appalling
                  economic conditions in the diamond mines. The South African campaign
                  is viewed as the start of Gandhi's experiments in political activism
                  that were refined and then carried over to the Independence movement
                  in India after World War One. The South African campaign has
                  largely been viewed as a failure. The government grew more oppressive
                  during the twenty two years that Gandhi spent in South Africa.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There isn't space here to provide
                  all the details that explain why South Africa was so difficult
                  to change. Needless to say the diversity of groups and interests
                  had much to do with the problem. An example of the conflicts
                  Gandhi faced is provided by his siding with the British government
                  against the Zulus in the Zulu Wars. This episode is ignored in
                  Attenborough's movie but is mentioned without apology in the
                  autobiography. According to Gandhi, if he wanted the full benefits
                  of British citizenship, the goal of the South African campaign,
                  then he felt a duty of loyalty to the British government in its
                  objectives, even if it meant the oppression of another group.
                  Gandhi's work with the ambulance corps in the Zulu Wars is commented
                  upon by director Shyam Benegal in his film about Gandhi. The
                  episode, in my opinion, reflects the complexity of the South
                  African scene as well as the continuing desire of Gandhi to be
                  the good, well-trained British barrister falling back on syllogisms
                  in a first class coach. Gandhi's break with this role would come
                  much later.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Attenborough attempts to capture
                  the transformation in the scene of Gandhi's return to India from
                  South Africa in 1915. He is shown coming off the ship at the
                  port of Bombay dressed in cotton shirt and dhoti with an oversized
                  turban. Western passengers on the ship comment on his dress and
                  wonder at how such a man could have challenged the South African
                  government. It is true the Gandhi's reputation had grown during
                  the South Africa campaign. But the transformation to Asian sage
                  was much slower and more complicated. Gandhi's personal transformation
                  goes back to his youth, his child marriage, his Western education
                  in England, his discovery of the Gita, Tolstoy, Ruskin, and Thoreau.
                  Attenborough suggests that Gandhi's Indianness was turned on
                  as a symbolic challenge to the Empire. The scene on the boat,
                  as well as the rest of the movie, views the battle as one between
                  authentic Indianness and oppressive Western machinery, whether
                  in the form of guns or the colonial bureaucracy.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">To the extent that the term
                  authenticity means anything (and I question whether it does),
                  Gandhi was far from authentic. He was a reformer, a consciousness
                  raiser. His success was his ability to synthesize Western ideas
                  and Eastern symbols in a way that dislocated and challenged settled
                  assumptions of hierarchy and power. What is amazing about Gandhi,
                  why he will always resonate as a Great Soul, is that he was one
                  person who through will and personality was able to catalyze
                  a movement. He combines the symbolic defiance of Rosa Parks or
                  Fred Korematsu with the leadership of Martin Luther King or Malcolm
                  X. Gandhi's strength, however, rested on the first role rather
                  than in the second. But Gandhi's symbolic politics is a complicated
                  one drawing on a rich past, both Western and Eastern. At its
                  best, his politics provides a rich view of the universal; at
                  its worst, it is mere petulance, reducing complicated social
                  and political choices to ones of what type of clothing to wear,
                  of whether or not to drink orange juice, or how to practice one's
                  sex life.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If taken as entertainment,
                  Attenborough's film is a grand one. Perhaps it falls into that
                  newly vintaged category of &quot;infotainment.&quot; As one of
                  the few, perhaps the only, representation of an Asian or Asian
                  American lawyer on the big screen, the film needs to be treasured.
                  The scene on the train captures much of what is at stake. Law's
                  violence is juxtaposed against law's logic, with logic ending
                  up in a pile on a dirty platform at the end. Law as play is carefully
                  delineated with Gandhi as actor, challenging the symbols held
                  unquestioned by the trinity of oppressor, oppressed, and state
                  agent. And Gandhi's life, whether squeezed into pure theater
                  in Attenborough's movie or in the pages of Gandhi scholarship,
                  is about transforming law as logic into law as play. For what
                  Gandhi did for all of us, starting with his training as barrister
                  and moving to his skills as negotiator, was to create experience
                  by staging moments that challenged law's violence and by showing
                  how law's logic needs to be supplemented with law's practice
                  and action.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There was one colored attorney
                  in South Africa. There seems to be one Asian attorney in the
                  Movies. Is there some film maker out there willing to add more?
                  Eric Paul Fournier's documentary <i>Of Civil Wrongs and Rights:
                  The Fred Korematsu Story</i> provides an excellent time capsule
                  of the various attorneys who were instrumental in the coram nobis
                  petition that lead to reparations for the internment during World
                  War Two. More work like that would be invaluable. I have got
                  ideas. Call me. Otherwise, we will be stuck still trying to get
                  a ticket on a first class coach to anywhere.</font></p>
