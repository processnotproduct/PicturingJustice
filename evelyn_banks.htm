                  by Taunya Lovell Banks</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bruce Beresford's latest film,
                  <i>Evelyn</i>, is a feel-good Irish version of the 1997 PBS documentary
                  <i>The Orphan Trains</i> (directed by Janet Graham and Edward
                  Gray). <i>The Orphan Trains</i> documents the removal of more
                  than 100,000 impoverished children from the streets of New York
                  City between 1854 and 1929 to homes in rural America. Large numbers
                  of impoverished children from other urban areas like Boston,
                  Chicago and Philadelphia also were sent to the country in a misguided
                  effort to &quot;rescue&quot; them. Some children were adopted
                  by farm families, but many worked as farm laborers. Ireland adopted
                  a similar policy in the 1940s and 1950s.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/evelyn5.jpg" width="211" height="142" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Evelyn</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> reminds us that misguided government
                  policies separating families are not unique to the United States.
                  In 1953 Evelyn Doyle's mother runs off leaving her husband to
                  care for their three children. Evelyn's doting father, Desmond
                  Doyle (played by Pierce Brosnan), is unemployed and overly fond
                  of the drink, so the state intercedes for the alleged welfare
                  of the children. The children are placed in institutions run
                  by the Catholic Church, and the stage is set for the battle to
                  regain custody. Doyle decides to take on both the government
                  and the Catholic Church. <i>Evelyn</i> is about Desmond's attempt
                  to regain custody of his children.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the first of several courtroom
                  scenes, the Magistrate tells Desmond that he is losing his children
                  because he has no job or mother for his children. When the Catholic
                  nuns come in to clean the children and the house, one wonders
                  whether Desmond's real offense is not having a wife rather than
                  being impoverished. The clear implication is that in Ireland
                  during the 1950s, fathers could not have sole custody of their
                  children without the consent of the mothers. Many of the legal
                  questions about the case, however, are not fully developed--in
                  part because the story is told from the point-of-view of eight-year-old
                  Evelyn.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The film addresses several
                  legal obstacles. The first is the black letter of the Children's
                  Act of 1941. The Act said that a child could only be removed
                  from the church-run institutions with the consent of their &quot;parents.&quot;
                  The Irish Court interprets the law as requiring the consent of
                  both living parents. Since Evelyn's mother's whereabouts are
                  unknown, it is impossible under the law for Doyle to regain custody
                  of his children. In theory, at least, had Desmond run off instead
                  of Evelyn's mother, the children still would have been removed.
                  Whether this actually happened is unclear. Many viewers may assume
                  that mothers retained custody of their children after being abandoned
                  by their husbands, or that children were never taken when both
                  parents were present in the home. The reality not evident in
                  <i>Evelyn</i> is much grimmer.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A second significant legal
                  issue that is not adequately explained to American audiences
                  is the reluctance of the Irish Supreme Court to overturn a statute
                  enacted by the legislature. The notion of judicial review is
                  so widely accepted in this country, it might be hard for American
                  viewers to appreciate the institutional significance of the Doyle
                  case. Although the 1937 Constitution gives the Irish Supreme
                  Court the power to judicially review statutes, the Court had
                  not exercised the power to invalidate a statute until the Doyle
                  case.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Evelyn</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is based on an actual 1953 case that became
                  a cause celebre in Ireland. Church-run schools, called &quot;Magdalens,&quot;
                  were dreaded places occupied by pregnant unmarried girls and
                  children deemed troublemakers, juvenile delinquents, orphans,
                  or destitute. Since Evelyn's experiences in the institution are
                  relatively benign, the film's focus is on the court battle. What
                  seems to make this case somewhat unique in the 1950s is that
                  the father is fighting for custody. Once more the unstated assumption
                  in the film is that in custody battles during this era fathers
                  generally lose, at least in countries where the prevailing societal
                  presumption is that children are better off with mothers rather
                  than fathers.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Evelyn</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> leaves many important questions unanswered.
                  We never learn why the legislature enacted the 1941 law, or why
                  Evelyn's mother decided to leave her children. Evelyn Doyle,
                  after selling her story to the filmmakers, penned a memoir with
                  the same name that became a best seller in the United Kingdom.
                  A version of this memoir, entitled <i>Tea and Green Ribbons</i>,
                  was released in the United States in December. In the memoir
                  Evelyn writes that when at age 21 she found and confronted her
                  runaway mother, the woman gave &quot;her reasons&quot; for leaving.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Evelyn's mother left six, not
                  three, children, and a drunken unemployed husband. Many men have
                  left home for less reason, but society tends to frown more when
                  mothers leave. Thus, the viewing audiences may be tempted to
                  overlook or downplay Desmond's faults. It helps when Desmond
                  is played by an attractive film star like Brosnan. The film also
                  lets the Catholic Church off lightly. Doyle's lawyers allude
                  to the Church as a powerful opponent, but the force of the Church
                  is never clearly displayed in the film. We are left wondering
                  why the government fought so hard for such a seemingly insignificant
                  case.<br>
<br>
                  One picky criticism about lack of consistency: in the final scene
                  of <i>Evelyn</i> there is a prominent &quot;placement&quot; of
                  a Kellogg's Corn Flakes box on top of the refrigerator. First,
                  it is highly unlikely that an Irish working class household in
                  the 1950s, still recovering from World War II, would have an
                  American cereal in the house. Second, even if Desmond's Irish-born,
                  but American raised, lawyer sent him a box of cereal, the filmmaker's
                  Kellogg's corn flakes box looks like the contemporary box, not
                  like a 1950's box.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A better film for raising many
                  issues present in <i>Evelyn</i> and adding several more is Phillip
                  Noyce's latest film, <i>Rabbit Proof Fence</i> (2002), a powerful
                  film about family, culture and cultural conflict, and my personal
                  favorite for 2002. Australia is attempting to come to grips with
                  the consequences of a government policy authorizing the removal
                  of &quot;mixed race&quot; children, children of aboriginals and
                  whites, from their parents and placement in church-run institutions.
                  These children, called the Stolen Generation, are at the center
                  of a raging debate in Australia over whether the removal policy
                  was simply misguided benevolence or genocide directed at eliminating
                  the aboriginal community. The film clearly states that the goal
                  for the removal of mixed race children was to assimilate and
                  whiten their offspring, minimizing growth within the aboriginal
                  community -- genocide.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">What <i>Rabbit Proof Fence</i>
                  indicates more clearly than <i>Evelyn</i> is how governments,
                  and often religious institutions, use law to undercut parental
                  authority and autonomy, especially in situations where parents
                  are dependent upon government largess (food, shelter, etc.) One
                  important difference, however, is that the parents in <i>Rabbit
                  Proof Fence</i> did not have available to them the same formal
                  legal remedies to challenge the removal of their children as
                  Desmond Doyle. Our question should be why not.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Finally, after viewing <i>Evelyn,
                  Rabbit Proof Fence</i> or <i>The Orphans Trains</i>, we should
                  ask ourselves whether each country has learned anything about
                  when and how government should intervene in family life. The
                  hard question is how to determine when government intervention
                  is well-meaning and even if well-meaning, misguided.<br>
