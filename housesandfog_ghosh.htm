                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Vadim Perelman's <i>House of
                  Sand and Fog</i> follows a formula as old as Hegel. The movie
                  depicts a battle between two conflicting claims of right, both
                  justifiable and understandable. The problem is that both claims
                  cannot be satisfied, and the result is a solution based on passion
                  and prejudice. The popular appeal of the movie is that it provides
                  a two-hour amusement park ride through that basic principle.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/housesandfog.jpg" width="94" height="140" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Jennifer
                  Connelly plays Kathy Nicolo, a woman abandoned by her husband
                  in a California, oceanview house that belongs to her family.
                  The painful emotions brought on by abandonment are salved by
                  alcohol, and Kathy misses a tax payment (a tax, we eventually
                  learn, that was improperly levied). She is awakened from her
                  stupor by the bank officer and a policeman one morning and is
                  evicted from her home. The policeman, Officer Lester Burdon befriends
                  her and becomes in some ways her savior and her undoing. Paralleling
                  the eviction is the story of Colonel Behrani, a former official
                  for the Shah of Iran in exile in the Bay Area working a road
                  crew on the Golden Gate Bridge and Marin County to rebuild his
                  dream, a house like the one by the Caspian Sea that he lost in
                  the revolution. Ben Kingsley, adding another ethnic embellishment
                  to his acting record, emphasizes the colonel's officiousness.
                  Although his stern manner may suggest his foreign, military roots,
                  he is actually the quintessential American go-getter, a survivor
                  focused on capturing his dreams. When he buys Kathy's repossessed
                  house at a bank auction with plans to resell it at four times
                  the price, he not only sets the stage for the conflict over equally
                  defensible rights, but also symbolizes the American dream of
                  success. After all, the colonel is the winner, Kathy, the loser.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But what does the battle mean?
                  Does justice prevail at the end or is the film no different from,
                  let's say, a Governor Schwarzenegger film, full of sound and
                  fury and two-fisted action, signifying nothing? Fans of the writer
                  Andres Dubus III will recognize similarities between <i>House
                  of Sand and Fog</i> and <i>In the Bedroom</i>, the film that
                  received lots of Oscar buzz in 2001. Both films are based on
                  fictional works by Dubus. Both are about the search for vindication.
                  Both are about the tension between passion and reason. And both
                  show lawyers in less than a favorable light. Dubus' work lays
                  bare the emotion that is masked by legal process and social convention.
                  The murdered son in <i>In the Bedroom</i> comes from a good family,
                  and his death is a consequence of mixing with folks from the
                  wrong side of the tracks. The father's guilt stems from his indulgence
                  of the son's sexual experimentation. The best scene occurs when
                  the father speaks with the criminal lawyer who is prosecuting
                  the case against his son's murderer. We are shown first the lawyer
                  presenting, in an attempt at sympathy, the weaknesses in the
                  state's case. But then we are made to focus on what the father
                  focuses on: the lawyer playing with change in his pocket, his
                  fidgeting, and several other signs of the lawyer's disinterest.
                  When the father takes justice into his own hand, the passion,
                  repressed by process and convention, is unleashed, but we are
                  left wondering whether he really feels any satisfaction.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Like <i>In The Bedroom</i>,
                  <i>House of Sand and Fog</i> depicts the failure of the rule
                  of law in the face of deeply seated passions. It is an act of
                  passion that causes Kathy Nicolo to lose her house. When her
                  legal aid attorney curtly informs Kathy that she would still
                  have her house if only she had opened her mail, she is questioning
                  her client's fall into despondency, depression, and alcohol.
                  Kathy's response is that she could have gotten her house back
                  if only the lawyer had done her &quot;fucking job.&quot; The
                  failure of authority figures to deal with the problem is demonstrated
                  even more clearly by Sheriff Burdon, the man who helped to evict
                  Kathy and the man with whom she begins an affair. To call the
                  sheriff a rogue officer is an understatement. Having lost all
                  passion in his marriage, Burdon finds Kathy to be an attractive
                  companion. Their relationship, however, is mutually exploitative.
                  Burdon is using his position of power within the legal system
                  to win over Kathy, and Kathy perhaps sees Burdon, not only as
                  an available sexual partner, but also as an agent, substituting
                  for the legal aid attorney, in getting her house back. Their
                  passion veils a complex set of interests and motivations.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Despite the fact the Burdon
                  sees the colonel only as a man who buys houses cheap and sells
                  them at a sizeable mark-up, the colonel too is a man of passion.
                  He wants to regain the lost status that he had in Iran. Part
                  of the status includes his love for his family and his identity
                  within the broader community of exiles. While many may dismiss
                  this motivation as a longing for the bad old days of the Shah,
                  it is worth recognizing that the colonel is attempting to engage
                  in a transaction that would have been forbidden one hundred years
                  ago in California because of his ethnicity and alienage. Alien
                  land laws would have prevented the colonel from purchasing the
                  property. In light of this history, his actions symbolize a vindication.
                  At one point in the film, he tells his son that they deserve
                  the house and Kathy does not because she is a wasteful American
                  while they have worked to buy and maintain the property. As with
                  Kathy's relation to the property, the colonel's is also imbued
                  with emotion and passion. The conflict between the two over the
                  property illustrates how passions interfere with the language
                  of interests.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There is one moment when reconciliation
                  appears possible. After seeing how devastated and desperate Kathy
                  has become, the colonel agrees to forebear from selling the house
                  and to allow Kathy to regain possession while he retains title.
                  This settlement, one that would make Ronald Coase proud, turns
                  out to be the seed of the final, deadly confrontation. It might
                  make a useful classroom exercise to study why the attempt at
                  settlement failed. The source of the failure is a lack of trust.
                  Sheriff Burdon acts as Kathy's agent in the final transaction,
                  and for the colonel and his family, the Sheriff is a symbol of
                  renegade, illegitimate authority. He has harassed them in the
                  past, threatening deportation and resurrecting fears of how the
                  Savak dealt with enemies of the state in the Shah's Iran. Sheriff
                  Burdon does not trust the colonel in turn, and the reason may
                  be racial or an urge to protect Kathy. Given the doubts about
                  legal process depicted in this film (and in <i>In the Bedroom</i>),
                  it is not surprising that an agent of the state becomes the catalyst
                  for disaster. Order is impossible given the characters involved
                  and the situations they are in.<br>
<br>
                  <i>House of Sand and Fog</i> perhaps is unduly pessimistic about
                  the rule of law and the pursuit of property. The film is, however,
                  a useful catalyst for a discussion on how law fails when passions
                  and interests collide.</font></p>
