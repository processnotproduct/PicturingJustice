                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A Roundtable on Minority
                  Lawyers</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">&quot;WE HAVE MET THE ENEMY,
                  AND HE IS US&quot; <a href="http://www.nauticom.net/www/chuckm/whmte.htm">Pogo</a></font><br>
<br>
                  <font size="-1" face="Verdana">As more and more minority and
                  ethnic lawyers enter the mix, we are seeing more and more images
                  of such lawyers in popular culture. Movies and television have
                  for the most part failed to identify such lawyers (with the notable
                  exception of woman laywers) as marginalized, or apart from the
                  American mainstream. The notion that lawyers might carry remnants
                  of their ethnic or minority past with them was alien, just as
                  the notion that white male Anglo-American lawyers were considered
                  the norm was never articulated. As minorities in general became
                  more visible in popular culture so too did minority professionals:
                  physicians, nurses, teachers, dentists, politicians---and lawyers.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Thus began the examination
                  of the minority or ethnic lawyer as both a product of her culture
                  and a product of the law school and legal system. What did and
                  what do ethnic and minority lawyers bring to the practice and
                  interpretation of law? How are they perceived by the mainstream
                  popular culture? Do the traditional views of the legal system
                  (the law as game, for example) hold true in popular culture representations
                  of the minority and ethnic attorney? Has she been co-opted, is
                  she a mole within the legal system, working for justice, or is
                  she completely ineffectual?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In any case, in popular culture's
                  estimation is the lawyer herself ever truly an integrated member
                  of society, or are lawyers part of an &quot;alien nation&quot;?
                  Do legal language, legal training and legal ways of thinking
                  inevitably separate the lawyer from the lawyered? Are African
                  American lawyers alienated both by racial identify and by cultural
                  norms from the accepted &quot;lawyerly mainstream&quot;? Can
                  Native American lawyers ever reconcile white man's law practice
                  with the independent legal system of the reservation? Are non-Anglo-American,
                  non-white lawyers at a disadvantage when trying to reconcile
                  Western and non-Western notions of justice? Current television
                  shows that examine at least some of these issues with regard
                  to the non-white and/or non-male U.S. lawyer include <i>Girlfriends</i>,
                  <i>Any Day Now</i>, <i>Soul Food</i>, and the upcoming <i>Queens
                  Supreme</i> (slated for a PJ roundtable) and A.U.S.A.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This roundtable suggests that
                  more serious study is needed regarding some of the individual
                  and group representations of ethnic and minority lawyers. Counter-intuitively,
                  in pop culture they are legion and include Native American lawyers,
                  Hindu lawyers, African-American male and female lawyers, non-white
                  judges, and the truly alien lawyer, the attorney in science fiction.</font></p>
