            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by John Denvir</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
            I have always wondered what makes some people respond to the
            sufferings of others while most of us do not. For instance, only
            about 2% of German gentiles took any action to aid German Jews
            in the Nazi era. We are sensitive to injustices we personally
            experience, but some people seem to be blessed with a greater
            imaginative capacity that allows them to picture and respond
            to the experience of others.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I call this capacity the &quot;injustice
            gene&quot;, although I recognize that I am talking metaphor rather
            than biology. Gandhi had it, as did Martin Luther King. And a
            lot of less famous people have it too, many of them entering
            law students. Whether the gene remains dormant or shapes their
            careers in large part is determined by their early professional
            experiences.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/motorcycle diaries.jpg" width="162" height="107" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Walter
            Salles <i>The Motorcycle Diaries</i> illustrates this point.
            It's a &quot;road&quot; picture, telling the tale of a 8000 mile
            motorcycle trip taken by two young Argentineans in the early
            1950's. One, Alberto, is chubby and gregarious; the other, Ernesto,
            quietly handsome. Their goal is to live a great adventure to
            remember in their old age. The first half of the movie consists
            of the endless mechanical problems the motorcycle suffers and
            various hustles the two chums engage in to keep housed and fed.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">We know little about these
            two young men other than one is a bio-chemist graduate and the
            other a medical student and that they have the romantic plan
            to end their trip volunteering at a leper asylum up the Amazon.
            But we slowly get to know them. Alberto is the more easy going,
            willing to say and do whatever is necessary to keep the show
            on the road, Ernesto is more intense, sometimes showing a streak
            of brutal honesty in telling a potential host that the cyst on
            his neck is actually a tumor or an amateur novelist that his
            chef d'oeuvre is a pack of clich&eacute;s. But Ernesto also manifests
            a capacity for compassion when he leaves his asthma medicine
            with a dying woman or gives the twosome's reserve funds to a
            migrant couple.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The trip turns out to be more
            than a series of amusing anecdotes; it becomes a life-transforming
            experience for both Alberto and Ernesto. They have left their
            cocoon of middle class comfort to witness the reality confronting
            the common men and women of Latin America &quot;So much injustice&quot;
            as Ernesto puts it. They also meet a doctor at the leper colony
            who treats them as valued professionals. They respond positively
            to his confidence and spend three weeks not only treating lepers
            with dignity as well as drugs. A key moment in the film is when
            both Alberto and Ernesto refuse to wear gloves they know are
            medically unnecessary while treating their patients. We are in
            the presence of the injustice gene.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Salles is too good a filmmaker
            to get preachy. He allows his images to tell the story. And he
            keeps a certain distance from his protagonists. The viewer knows
            coming in that the young Ernesto will become that icon of 60's
            revolutionary romanticism, Ch&eacute; Guevara. Salles is generous
            in his portrayal of Ch&eacute;, but not uncritical. We note a
            tendency to extremism in Ernesto's very dangerous and wholly
            unnecessary decision to swim the Amazon at night for one last
            visit with his leper comrades.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If Alberto and Ernesto had
            not visited the leper colony (or met a supportive mentor there)
            they might have ended up in Buenos Aires forty years later boring
            people with accounts of their great adventure. Instead Alberto
            practiced medicine in Cuba for forty years and Ernesto Ch&eacute;
            became one of the most admired revolutionaries of the second
            half of the 20th Century.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Mainline reviewers of the <i>Motorcycle
            Diaries</i> have been quick to disassociate themselves from Ch&eacute;
            who they are quick to dismiss as a Stalinist totalitarian. This
            seems to me to miss the point. First, it ignores the important
            question of to what extent the Cuban revolution's &quot;Stalinist&quot;
            tendencies were forced upon them by the United States insistence
            upon overturning a democratic revolution. But even if one decides
            that difficult factual question against Ch&eacute;, results are
            not determinative from an injustice gene perspective. If hindsight
            shows that our efforts to fight injustice were failures, or even
            wrong-headed, that fact does not detract from their nobility.<br>
<br>
            The &quot;smart&quot; reaction to the suffering of others will
            always be to ignore it. But that's a form of intelligence that
            some people refuse to embrace. We have no reason to doubt that
            the same ideals that inspired Ernesto to refuse to wear gloves
            in treating lepers in 1952 remained with Ch&eacute; when he died
            a revolutionary's death in an ill-fated attempt to overturn a
            manifestly unjust social system in Bolivia in 1967.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There is a lesson here for
            law students (and law schools too). Maybe clerking for large
            law firms is not the best use of short summer vacations. Here
            at USF Law School some students (with law school support) spend
            their summer working on death penalty cases in Texas. Happily
            so far no one has tried to swim the Rio Grande. <br>
