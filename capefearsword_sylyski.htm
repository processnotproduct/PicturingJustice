                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">By Leesa Sylyski<br>
<br>
                  The two versions of <i>Cape Fear</i> (Universal/Amblin/Cappa/Tribeca
                  1991, directed by Martin Scorsese), (Universal-International/Melville-Talbot
                  1962, directed by J. Lee Thompson), although similar in story
                  line, are very different. This inevitably leads to different
                  representations and critiques of the legal system. The characters
                  in the films are unique as reflected in their interactions with
                  the legal system. How is the legal system portrayed? In both
                  films, the legal system is criticized by exposing its nature
                  as a double-edged sword that is easily manipulated and inverted,
                  becoming both a tyrant and a protector. However, the '91 film
                  further depicts the legal system as fundamentally flawed when
                  it is asked to provide justice and protection from dysfunction.
                  I will deal with the two films separately.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/cape fear 1.jpg" width="150" height="212" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The premise of the
                  '62 film is that a lawyer, Sam, witnessed an assault on a woman
                  in a parking lot as he walked by one evening. Sam testified against
                  Max Cady and thus, helped to send Cady to jail for 14 years.
                  Cady is finally released, blames Sam for his conviction, and
                  sets out to terrorize Sam's family in order to deal Sam the same
                  type of loss Max feels Sam gave him. <br>
<br>
                  The '62 film shows how the legal system is not equally accessible
                  to all. It is a tyrant that is used to harass Cady. It does not
                  protect the rights against abuse and intimidation that citizens
                  are afforded in theory. The law is used at the discretion of
                  the Sheriff, at Sam's request. The legal system is criticized
                  by highlighting its availability to powerful people, such as
                  Sam, who have connections inside the police force. It is easily
                  manipulated and thereby transformed from being a protector to
                  tyrant.<br>
<br>
                  Cady is arrested for suspicion of being poor, a criticism of
                  how the law does, at this point in time, discriminate against
                  the poor. However, he is not actually poor and so cannot be charged
                  with vagrancy. He is also repeatedly brought into the station
                  to be questioned, however paltry the excuse. Indeed, the police
                  target him. Yet, they can go only so far in harassing Cady. The
                  legal system is shown to be very flexible, but only to a point,
                  as it eventually protects Cady when the police refuse to arrest
                  him for what he might do. Thus, the double-edge is shown. For
                  Cady, the legal system is inverted and is at once the tyrant
                  and protector. <br>
<br>
                  Cady responds then by using the law to his favor. He is protected
                  by it as he harasses Sam by appearing too often in the presence
                  of Sam's family. Cady uses it to disentitle Sam from protection.
                  He pushes Sam until Sam can no longer find protection, and moves
                  outside of the law to care for his family himself. Cady never
                  actually does anything to physically hurt the family before he
                  appears at Cape Fear, except possibly poison the family's dog.
                  Sam tries to bribe Cady into leaving town, but is unsuccessful.
                  Thugs are hired then to convince Cady to leave town one way or
                  another, also to no avail. There simply is no legal reason why
                  Cady needs to leave town. However, these acts lead to Sam's disbarment
                  hearing. The legal community would likely not stand for one of
                  its members to be acting outside the law in this manner. There
                  is no professional or legal protection for Sam. He faces the
                  law as his tyrant. <br>
<br>
                  In a further criticism of the law, Sam was seeking protection
                  and due to his connections had his own &quot;hired gun&quot;,
                  a police officer, come to Cape Fear. It is unlikely that an ordinary
                  citizen could call the police and be provided with a private
                  guard due to mere suspicion of the possibility of harm. <br>
<br>
                  The law becomes a destructive force for Sam, until he employs
                  elements of natural justice to protect his family. These elements
                  include the right to defend one's self and family from harm.
                  In doing so, he brings himself back into the fold of the legal
                  system. The double-edge works both for and against Sam. At the
                  end of the film, Sam does not kill Cady; he leaves punishment
                  to the legal system. The viewer is left with the hope that the
                  legal system is just and will punish wrongdoers. Sherwin states
                  that &quot;[l]aw clearly has its limitation; it cannot insulate
                  us completely from the risk of antisocial violence. But it can
                  do justice when such violence ultimately erupts&quot; (R. K.
                  Sherwin, &quot;Cape Fear: Law's Inversion and Cathartic Justice&quot;
                  (1996) 30 University of San Francisco Law Review at 1025 [hereinafter,
                  Sherwin]). The double-edged sword is left as a protector. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/cape fear 2.jpg" width="150" height="209" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The '91 film contains
                  the same elements of inversion, tyranny, and protection as are
                  found in the '62 version. However, the double-edged sword is
                  not only portrayed visually, by Cady's tattoo, but also symbolically
                  in Cady. The critique of the legal system in the '91 version
                  depicts it to be fundamentally flawed, as it cannot provide justice
                  or protection from dysfunction. <br>
<br>
                  Sam lives in a shadowy world where he chose in withholding evidence,
                  not to zealously represent his client. Sam stated &quot;Fourteen
                  years ago, in this case, I had a report on the victim. . . .
                  rape and aggravated sexual battery. Anyway I had a report on
                  this victim and it came back that she was promiscuous. And I
                  buried it . . . I didn't show it to the client, I didn't show
                  it to the prosecution. But if you had seen what this guy had
                  done to this girl. . . .&quot; Nevins explains the legal background
                  when he states <i>[t]raditionally, when a man was charged with
                  rape, all information about the woman's prior sexual activity
                  was admissible either to show consent or to impeach her credibility
                  as a witness. She could be cross-examined about sexual contact
                  with the defendant or any third party, previous sexual partners
                  could testify about their own affairs with her, and the defendant
                  could introduce evidence as to her sexual reputation within the
                  community.</i> (F.M Nevins, &quot;Cape Fear Dead Ahead: Transforming
                  A Thrice-Told Tale Of Lawyers And Law&quot; (2000) 24 Legal Studies
                  Forum, online: Law in Popular Culture Collection - E-texts &lt;<a href="http://www.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/lsf/nevinscape24.htm">http://www.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/lsf/nevinscape24.htm</a>&gt;
                  (Date accessed: 4 March 2003) [hereinafter Nevins]).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In an inversion of the legal
                  system, Sam by not submitting the requisite evidence and having
                  the law deal with Cady, became judge and jury rather than the
                  lawyer. Thus, Sam exists outside the legal system when it suits
                  him. He is an inversion of protection and is thereby the tyrant.
<br>
<br>
                  These scenes portray the legal system as an unjust system where
                  a rapist would once again go free. There is no legal justice
                  for the rape victims, however natural justice, which is the finding
                  of guilt due to Sam's intervention, prevails. It is interesting
                  to note that the law has not been this way since the 1970's,
                  thus this premise is a gross misrepresentation of the law in
                  1991(Nevins).<br>
<br>
                  Cady soon manages to rattle Sam enough that Sam tries to persuade
                  Cady to leave town by offering him money. Cady refuses and then
                  proceeds to tape-record Sam's threat of harm. Sam does not want
                  to hire thugs to dispense of Cady, believing this would be wrong,
                  but the audience has already witnessed Sam's use of the legal
                  system at his convenience. At this point in time, the system
                  is not to his liking and so engages the thugs. This act, of course,
                  is once again outside the bounds of the legal system, allowing
                  Cady to come under the protection of the law and gain a restraining
                  order against Sam. <br>
<br>
                  Cady wants to impose his own sense of biblical justice on Sam
                  and is facilitated by the restraining order. Sam looks to be
                  completely wrong and states: &quot;It's all fucked up&#133; I
                  mean, the law considers me more of a loose cannon than Max Cady.&quot;
                  Sam is faced with an inversion of the law that is not his choice.
                  He is tyrannized by the legal system while Cady's acts are enabled.
                  He, rather than Cady, is now the criminal. <br>
                  In the '91 film, Sam is a morally reprehensible character. His
                  relationship with his wife and daughter are repugnant and they
                  &quot;are up to their necks in barely repressed, at times irrepressible,
                  violence&quot; (Sherwin, supra at 1031). Instead of Sam being
                  the loving husband he was in the '61 version, he is now inverted
                  and is the tyrant of his wife, Leigh. The viewer is shown that
                  his wife knows he has had affairs at least twice. Leigh has previously
                  suffered from depression, and sometimes lashes out physically
                  at him when instead of acknowledging that he could be the cause
                  of her depression, he blames her for having been in a poor emotional
                  state. For Leigh, there is no justice for Sam's deceit.<br>
<br>
                  In two scenes, the viewer is shown the barely repressed tension
                  between Sam and his daughter, Danny. Firstly, when at the beginning
                  of the film, the family is getting a snack after watching a movie.
                  Sam playfully wrestles with his daughter, until his arm becomes
                  wrapped too tightly around Danny's neck and she begins to cough.
                  Secondly, in a scene in Danny's room, Sam tells her to &quot;put
                  on some clothes&quot; as she is no longer a child. As Danny smiles,
                  he roughly pushes his hand over her mouth and presses her into
                  the bed. She starts to cry and Sam leaves the room. Sam is not
                  the protective father he was in the '61 version. Sherwin asks
                  the reader to &quot;[c]onsider Danny's relationship with her
                  father, a relationship that is blocked on the one hand by his
                  repressed eroticized and aggressive impulses toward her, &#133;and
                  hampered on the other by his repressed guilt, a guilt that may
                  well be driven, at least in part, by Sam's own impermissible
                  attraction to his daughter's raw sexuality&quot; (Sherwin, supra
                  at 1031). He is now inverted and is the incestuous tyrant. There
                  is no protection or justice for Danny against these repulsive
                  acts. <br>
<br>
                  The legal system is demonstrated as completely inadequate to
                  deal with the reprehensible dealings of a man with his family.
                  Indeed, the system was never intended to deal with these types
                  of actions. There is certainly no one for the daughter and wife
                  to complain to about Sam's acts. The legal system has no method
                  to return the trust that Sam has robbed from them. There is no
                  justice, no evening the score. <br>
<br>
                  The family finds Sam vile, as does Cady. In Cady's own mind,
                  justice would be served by punishing Sam for his loss. Cady believes
                  he had lost his family when he was sent to jail and thus seeks
                  to take away Sam's family. He intends to impose a biblical eye-for-an-eye
                  type of justice on Sam. It is depicted to be necessary to resort
                  to another type of justice to punish Sam's failings, for the
                  satisfaction of both the family and Cady.<br>
<br>
                  The final scenes are of very powerful struggles between Sam,
                  Cady, and the family. They can also be seen as conflict between
                  natural justice for Sam (ie. the death of Cady and salvation
                  of the family), biblical justice for Cady (ie. the death of Sam
                  and/or violation of his family), and the legal system that completely
                  failed the family. The scenes clearly demonstrate how the legal
                  system fails in dealing with morally reprehensible acts, yet
                  shows that other means of dealing with vile acts are not necessarily
                  any better. The outcome of biblical justice would not serve the
                  family, as it would not deal with the questionable morals of
                  Sam and the family would still be violated. The outcome of natural
                  justice, which with speculating, may have been to have Cady drowned,
                  would be insufficient for the family, as Sam would again escape
                  punishment. The film shows the difficulty of imposing a suitable
                  a solution for Cady, Sam, and the family. <br>
<br>
                  Cady is saved from being killed by Sam by a sudden shift of the
                  wind, and instead is drowned at sea. Sherwin states that &quot;[i]n
                  the end we are left with fateful justice, justice as chance&quot;(Sherwin,
                  supra at 1042). The viewer is left unsatisfied. The double-edged
                  sword remains a tool of justice, but not a provider of justice
                  or protection. It is easily manipulated and inverted, becoming
                  both a tyrant and a protector. There are no answers to the failings
                  of the legal system.</font></p>
