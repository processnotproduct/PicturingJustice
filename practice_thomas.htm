                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Jeffrey Thomas</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I thoroughly enjoyed the premier
                  episode of <i>The Practice</i>, &quot;The Candidate&quot; (part
                  1). In typical fashion, it raised a variety of interesting issues
                  in a provocative way. As with other episodes, this one explored
                  the uncertainty between guilt and innocence, interjected several
                  ethical conundrums, and considered the importance of media coverage
                  of the legal system, all in the context of a case about a popular
                  and persuasive state senator. Although these are fascinating
                  issues, what caught my attention was this episode's depiction
                  of the role of personal expectations in the search for truth.
                  It showed that people, including those who operate our legal
                  system, can be blinded by their personal expectations of the
                  truth.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">From the outset, all of the
                  players believe that Senator Keith Ellison shot his wife's lover.
                  The police, prosecutors, and even the defense attorneys focus
                  on evidence to support this belief. The prosecutors obtain a
                  warrant to take a bodily fluid sample from his wife looking for
                  proof of the affair. The police test only the Senator for gunshot
                  residue. The defense team interview witnesses to assess evidence
                  of the affair. The Senator's daughter is ordered to give a statement
                  to the prosecution, and her testimony neatly fits everyone's
                  expectations. The story is further solidified when the Senator
                  publicly &quot;confesses&quot; that he shot the victim in the
                  mistaken belief that he was attacking the Senator's wife.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">When the daughter takes the
                  stand at trial, however, she tells a different story. This time,
                  she claims to have shot the victim. The prosecution immediately
                  assumes that the daughter is lying to protect her father, as
                  does the defense team. The prosecution, with the consent of the
                  judge, offer to give the daughter immunity if she'll recant,
                  and when the defense takes this offer to their client, her father,
                  the Senator decides to plead guilty in an apparent attempt to
                  protect his daughter.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After the court accepts the
                  Senator's plea, and during the press conference in which the
                  Senator explains that he changed his plea to protect his daughter,
                  the truth finally comes out. It wasn't the Senator after all,
                  which is no surprise to regular viewers. My point, however, is
                  that no one-not the police, the prosecution, or the defense-considered
                  the any possibility other than the Senator. The linked <a href="images/the practice clip 9-23.mpg">video
                  clip</a> delivers the punch line. (Don't view it if you don't
                  want to know who did it.)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">My point is that all of us
                  perceive reality through our own set of expectations, and tend
                  to fit the evidence and data we collect into our expectations.
                  Perhaps we should be more circumspect as we piece together a
                  story.</font></p>
