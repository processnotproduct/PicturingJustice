                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Sheila Simon</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Some teachers think the subject
                  matter of their class is so all encompassing that it affects
                  everything, right?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Guilty. I'm one of those teachers.
                  I teach family law, and I see it everywhere - in the newspaper,
                  in novels, and in movies. That's where it becomes fun. Using
                  movies as a common reference I can show students what I see,
                  and give them an idea of how they may see things by the end of
                  the semester. Move over, Professor Kingsfield - <i>Austin Powers</i>
                  helps me teach family law!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/austinpowers.jpg" width="174" height="215" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">When
                  I saw <i>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</i>, I decided
                  to use it as a focus for my first class that semester. In addition
                  to the usual assignment of cases on the development of law regarding
                  procreation and privacy, I asked the students to contemplate
                  the family relationships portrayed in <i>The Spy Who Shagged
                  Me</i>, and in its predecessor, <i>Austin Powers</i>, <i>International
                  Man of Mystery</i>.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the first class session
                  I asked for a volunteer to describe the two movies and note the
                  family relationships. As expected, more hands were raised for
                  this job than for the description of Griswold v Connecticut.
                  The relationships noted were: <br>
<br>
                  Parent and child: <br>
                  Dr. Evil and Scott Evil <br>
                  Mrs. Kensington and Vanessa Kensington <br>
<br>
                  Husband and wife:<br>
                  Austin Powers and Vanessa Kensington<br>
<br>
                  Unmarried sexual partners: <br>
                  Felicity Shagwell and Fat Bastard,<br>
                  Frau Farbissina and Unibrow<br>
                  Dr. Evil and Frau Farbissina<br>
                  Austin Powers and Felicity Shagwell<br>
<br>
                  Cloned and clone:<br>
                  Dr. Evil and Mini-Me</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">With those relationships established,
                  we explored how family law was important to the plot, and how
                  family law would be called upon to resolve the many questions
                  presented by the movie.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Is it creepy, illegal, or both
                  for Austin Powers to love Mrs. Kensington and later fall for
                  her daughter Vanessa? And when Austin marries Vanessa and she
                  turns out to be an exploding femme-bot, what is left of the marriage?
                  Was the marriage void or voidable?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Who could inherit from Dr.
                  Evil - his son, Scott Evil, or Dr. Evil's clone, Mini-Me, or
                  both?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">What if Felicity Shagwell becomes
                  pregnant after her encounter with Fat Bastard? Would Fat Bastard
                  have any rights regarding the child? Would he have any obligations?
                  If Austin were to marry Felicity, what rights would Austin have
                  in regard to the child? Why is the term &quot;bastard&quot; an
                  insult? And how recently was it that the statute on establishing
                  parentage was called the Bastardy Act?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Can Frau Farbissina and Unibrow
                  marry? Does their legal status depend on where they live? Can
                  Unibrow get health insurance through Frau Farbissina's employment
                  at Virtucon? Does it depend on where Virtucon is located? Assuming
                  Frau Farbissina is Scott Evil's mother, does Farbissina's relationship
                  with Unibrow create any problems for a continued relationship
                  between Farbissina and Scott?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But the best set of questions
                  involves the relationship between Dr. Evil and his son Scott.
                  Scott is either the product of artificial insemination of Dr.
                  Evil's sperm or he is the love child of Dr. Evil and Frau Farbissina.
                  Should the nature of the child's origin have an impact on the
                  legal relationships between the parties? How does one establish
                  paternity either way? Are there time limits on establishing paternity,
                  and could those time limits be tolled if the biological father
                  did not know about the existence of the child?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">These questions about the nature
                  of how a child is created and how that can affect the legal status
                  of the relationships were so good that I brought the class back
                  to think about them again at the end of the semester - in the
                  final exam. The students may not appreciate my low-brow humor,
                  but they adopted the practice of looking for family law everywhere.
                  And that kind of thing really is my bag, baby.</font></p>
