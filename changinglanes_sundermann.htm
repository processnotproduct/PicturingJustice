                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Changing Lanes</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is modern day film noir-- not Humphrey
                  Bogart in a trench coat saving Lauren Bacall, but a gray urban
                  setting where the main characters must make moral choices in
                  a world that seems corrupt and uncaring.  This is a character-centered
                  film that takes place in one long day.<br>
                    <br>
                  <img src="images/changinglanes3.jpg" width="183" height="123" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Ben Affleck plays
                  a young yuppie lawyer and Samuel L. Jackson plays a middle-class
                  man who is trying to keep his wife and family from leaving him.
                   These two actors are very good in their parts, especially Jackson.
                   Both of these two very different men are on their way to court
                  that morning for very different reasons.  Affleck needs to present
                  a document that shows a deceased billionaire turned over control
                  of his foundation to Affleck's law firm.  The billionaire was
                  induced to sign when he was incompetent and near death.   Jackson
                  is on his way to a domestic hearing armed with a bank loan approval
                  to show to the court his plan to buy a house, hoping to convince
                  his fed-up wife not to move out of town with his two sons.  On
                  the way to court, the two have a fender-bender, in which no one
                  is hurt.  Jackson wants to exchange information and call the
                  police, but Affleck, who is in a hurry, hands Jackson a check
                  and drives off, leaving Jackson stranded in the middle of the
                  street.  Neither one of them has good luck when they arrive late
                  for court.  Jackson arrives as the hearing is concluding and
                  an uncaring judge gives him no chance to present his plan.  His
                  wife sees his being late as another example of his inability
                  to deal with problems and says she is moving. He is bitter and
                  incensed.  Affleck realizes that he has left the important documents
                  at the scene of the accident and is given until the end of the
                  day to produce them or he loses his case. Jackson, feeling aggrieved,
                  refuses to turn the documents over to Affleck, and the rest of
                  the film is a battle between Jackson and Affleck. We find out
                  a lot about the two men during the course of this day, their
                  flaws and their strengths, and they find out a lot about themselves.
                   During the film, both become able to see themselves as others
                  might see them.  Their journey of self-discovery is worth the
                  trip for moviegoers.<br>
<br>
                  Jackson clearly loves his wife and children and is a decent,
                  kind-hearted person.  He is also a recovering alcoholic and cannot
                  seem to stop doing dangerous and stupid things.  His goal is
                  to put his life back together and save his family.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Affleck works for a law firm
                  where ethics are a distraction or a hurdle to be overcome.  Over
                  the course of the day, he commits a series of improper acts to
                  protect his privileged life.  He leaves the scene of an accident,
                  assists in defrauding a charity, wrongly bankrupts a person,
                  and is on the verge of forging legal documents.  He married the
                  boss's daughter, so he is an up-and-comer at the law firm. <br>
<br>
                  Director Sydney Pollack, who as always is great as a rich and
                  cynical lawyer, plays Affleck's father-in-law and the senior
                  partner.  In a revealing scene, while Affleck is having lunch
                  with his wife, she tells him she knows all about her father's
                  corruption and unfaithfulness.  Like her mother, she has made
                  her bargain with the devil and expects Affleck to do what is
                  necessary to maintain their Wall Street life style.  The film
                  is not very kind to lawyers and leaves the all-too-typical Hollywood
                  impression that the only way to be successful in the practice
                  is to sell out in some way.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Because he felt mistreated,
                  Jackson refuses to return the file back to Affleck.  Affleck
                  then goes to a guy &quot;who can fix things.&quot;  This person
                  gets into the computer and foils Jackson's credit rating so his
                  home loan is disapproved.  The two go back and forth seeking
                  revenge, but this is more than a film about revenge; it is about
                  the lives and character of the two men.  The film is shot entirely
                  in New York City and is done in an almost documentary style.
                   Director Roger Michell, who did the very different romantic
                  comedy Notting Hill, shows here the same good touch for character
                  and relationships.<br>
<br>
                  The upbeat ending seems like it was tacked on after some preview
                  audiences requested it, but this is a really good film.  Lawyers
                  take a beating, but that is not a novelty anymore.
