                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Christine Alice Corcos</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The new Warner Brothers &quot;buddy&quot;
                  drama <i>Just Legal</i> is the creation of Jerry Bruckheimer
                  (<i>CSI</i>, <i>CSI: Miami</i>, <i>Without a Trace</i>) and Jonathan
                  Shapiro (<i>The Practice</i>).  It contains nothing new, but
                  in veteran hands, also including those of star Don Johnson (<i>Miami
                  Vice</i>) it clicks along. The plots are relatively interesting,
                  the bad guys get their comeuppance, Johnson leers at pretty girls
                  effectively, his co-star Jay Baruchel (<i>Million Dollar Baby</i>)
                  stumbles along charmingly. <i>Just Legal</i> renews one's faith
                  in the ability of the television industry to put together an
                  hour's worth (well, forty-two minutes' worth) of well-written,
                  acted and produced entertainment. <i>Just Legal</i>  is not wildly
                  original, but it's not meant to be. For a Monday night, sandwiched
                  in between <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> on CBS which has as a
                  character a law student easily dragged away from his books by
                  his love starved friends (including the &quot;I&quot; of the
                  title) and <i>Law &amp; Order</i>  and <i>Will &amp; Grace</i>
                  re-runs on various networks, this series represents the perfect
                  ham in an entertainment ham sandwich.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Just Legal</i>'s premise is that David Ross (Baruchel), a
                  nineteen year old fresh from passing the bar can't get hired
                  because he's too young. No high profile law firm wants him because
                  of his lack of real-world experience and maturity (<a href="#1">1</a>).
                   Even though he graduated first in his class, he takes a job
                  with a storefront (or beach front) law firm headed by jaded sole
                  practitioner Grant Cooper (Johnson). While Cooper claims to have
                  no dreams left, he hires Ross, and he lets Dulcinea (&quot;Dee&quot;)
                  Cruz (Jamie Lee  Kirchner) use his firm as a fake employer so
                  she can stay out on parole, because he botched her case. He snaps
                  up Ross with the promise that he'll get to try real cases, but
                  this promise is a lie-Cooper hasn't tried a real case himself
                  in years. He's afraid to litigate; he'd much rather settle any
                  case than face the opposition. The truth is, however, that Ross
                  doesn't want to try cases either, as he admits to the woman he
                  admires, Kate Manat (Susan Ward). She's taken the position that
                  he really wants, with a blue chip firm. But she's stuck taking
                  depositions and sitting fifth chair, while she'd much rather
                  be in the courtroom, doing battle. The grass is always greener.
                  In every episode, Ross spends much of the time doing research
                  into the case and trying to convince Cooper that the case, such
                  as it is, is winnable. Cooper, meanwhile, spends time telling
                  Ross that settling is better. Dee spends time telling both of
                  them that time is better spent on the beach enjoying the sun,
                  and when necessary, she separates the two right before they take
                  a poke at each other. Sometimes, she is the only individual in
                  this firm with any common sense, or any ability to mature.  She's
                  also pretty and feisty, and likely to appeal to the male audience.<br>
<br>
                  The second episode featured an African-American client in the
                  wrong place at the wrong time, accused of murdering a store clerk
                  during a robbery gone horribly amiss. Ross wants to defend him
                  to the limit, Cooper prefers to plead him out. Because this show
                  has a liberal bent, Ross wins, and the client is acquitted. The
                  writers introduce the viewers to some ugly little truths about
                  US law enforcement in the 21st century, among them that some
                  police officers still go after the nearest person of color when
                  a crime is called in, even if that person has no discernible
                  connection to the crime. <i>Just Legal</i> is thus a nice counterweight
                  to some of the other law dramas currently on the airwaves.<br>
<br>
                  Not every episode centers on a murder case, which is refreshing.
                  Episode three is a malpractice case, which allows Cooper, a recovering
                  alcoholic, to sniff the defendant physician's breath while asking
                  about an appointment to see if perhaps the man might be habitually
                  drunk, indeed might have been drinking on the day of Cooper's
                  client's operation. Ethical? The defendant's attorney is nowhere
                  around at the time, but it allows Johnson a star turn and gives
                  the writers an opportunity to inject some comments about alcoholism
                  in the medical and legal communities. On occasion David also
                  uses his friendship with Kate (whom Grant snidely refers to as
                  &quot;your girlfriend&quot;) to get information about witnesses
                  or case strategy as well.  Whether or not Grant urges him to
                  do so is not always clear, but what he learns from week to week
                  is that the real world is not law school, and the choices one
                  makes are often quite difficult. Quoting an ABA model rule is
                  easy. Living it is hard.<br>
<br>
                  What is disturbing about <i>Just Legal</i> is that the characters
                  seem to go back to square one in each episode and have the same
                  arguments each week. David lectures Grant on the nobility of
                  their client's cause as well as the presumption of innocence.
                  Grant lectures David on the futility of their client's cause
                  as well as the firm's continuing lack of cash. They go to court.
                  The client wins, usually because David does a lot of research,
                  stumbles his way through a witness examination, and Grant does
                  a (very) short opening and closing statement. (&quot;We will
                  present our evidence. We will convince you that we are right.
                  Thank you.&quot;) David messes up and Grant feeds him some helpful
                  lines. Quite obviously, David is supposed to help Grant recapture
                  his youthful idealism, and just as obviously Grant is intended
                  to help David mature. The problem is that the gap in age and
                  experience is such that realistically, neither is likely to help
                  the other achieve these goals very quickly. In the background
                  is pretty Kate, sending David's hormones into overdrive. Grant
                  reminds David that marrying pretty girls is another way to go
                  broke really quickly.<br>
<br>
                  However, the producers, writers, and actors on this series don't
                  intend it to be realistic. They intend it to be entertaining,
                  and it is. It is a huge amount of fun. The stories move along
                  with some style, if little originality. Johnson and Baruchel
                  have more charisma on screen than many other male pairs in similar
                  legal dramas. The supporting women characters actually have some
                  brains to complement their looks. Jay Baruchel looks lost and
                  cute, for the younger women in the audience. Susan Ward and Jamie
                  Lee Kirchner look beautiful for the benefit of all the men. And
                  for those of us females with a fondness for the older, but eternally
                  scruffy puppies out there, there's always Don Johnson. <hr align="LEFT"><br>
