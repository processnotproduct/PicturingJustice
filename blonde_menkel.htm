                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
                  </font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The brilliantly titled
                  <i>Legally Blonde</i> does more than turn those old &quot;blond&quot;
                  jokes around. It is also a brilliant satire of the closed culture
                  of the Eastern establishment. As Reese Witherspoon's seemingly
                  &quot;dumb and dumber&quot; character leaves her CULA (not really
                  my old university, UCLA) sorority house to attend Harvard Law
                  School and snag her preppie boyfriend back from the clutches
                  of Eastern propriety and snobbery, she teaches the audience a
                  few things about some less common bigotries. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/legally blonde 5.jpg" width="181" height="137" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">First, blonds are
                  not all stupid, even if they come to class in leather and carry
                  small dogs with them. Second, by studying hard, even a blond
                  LA valley girl obsessed with clothes can master the LSAT (the
                  only part of the film that seemed really fictional to me). Third,
                  diversity means diversity! If we want diversity in education
                  we have to look for it in lots of strange places. Fourth, common
                  sense can sometimes win out, even in a convoluted Socratic class.
                  Fifth, and least surprising, working class people are nicer than
                  Ivy league snobs and take care of each other. Sixth, girls do
                  bond, even across geographic and class lines and Seventh, and
                  most importantly, a good trial lawyer must do her fact investigation.<br>
<br>
                  With many characters &quot;ripped from the headlines,&quot; like
                  the Harvard law professor with a criminal defense practice run
                  out of a private law firm (a more dashing Alan Dershowitz), who
                  is also a sexual harasser, the younger second wife accused of
                  murdering her husband for the money (Anna Nicole Smith, anyone?)
                  and the tough Socratic law professor now in female drag (a nice
                  twist on the old Kingsfield theme) who turns out to have a heart
                  of gold (played winningly by our feckless female judge from <i>The
                  Practice</i>, the characters are as familiar as a Bugs Bunny
                  cartoon, but far more hilarious. Whether seen as a &quot;girl
                  bonding movie&quot; as one of my colleagues described it, or
                  a corrective to the seriousness of ONE L, this movie had this
                  transplanted east and west coast law professor (visiting at Harvard
                  Law School as it opened) in stitches. Yes, the portrayal of the
                  Harvard law students as brunette, earnest, cut-throat, preppie
                  and clannish was probably a bit over the top (my Harvard students
                  were unbelievably kind to each other and very geographically
                  and ethnically diverse), but it was true in an earlier Harvard
                  era and some of us old enough to remember it will find this classic
                  &quot;fish out of water&quot;tale a great send-up of eastern
                  snobbery. As one who has taught at the real UCLA and the real
                  Harvard (the Harvard of the film is actually USC's campus), this
                  tale of the clash of two cultures was uncommonly funny and I
                  bet will ring true in a strange way to transplanted students
                  of either coast or anywhere in between who seek their educations
                  in faraway domains and encounter regional, educational, racial,
                  ethnic, gender, life style or hair color discrimination. In other
                  words, serious schools -get a life! Law students really do come
                  from all walks of life these days and if they seem a bit ditzy,
                  just get over it! You can't tell the strength of a brain from
                  hair color. (Can't judge a book by its cover, did you all get
                  that?) I learned that lesson myself from my smart and blond &quot;surfer
                  boys&quot; at UCLA Law. <br>
<br>
                  For me, the real send-up of the movie was the classic trial scene
                  denouement as Witherspoon's clever character, Elle (the ur-&quot;she-woman&quot;)
                  slowly unravels, Perry Mason-like, the real killer with her detailed
                  knowledge of female cosmetics. Moral of the story, boys? Facts
                  really matter and good trial lawyers will come from all walks
                  of life as they know or master the facts of the witnesses they
                  must &quot;break down&quot; or the clients with whom they must
                  empathize. (Elle does both, beautifully!)<br>
<br>
                  Though the movie will seem derivative to fans of <i>Clueless,</i>
                  the ultimate Ur-LA movie, more legally inclined viewers should
                  be able to both laugh and see the more important real human messages
                  in this film. Women's stuff matters (relationships, facts, being
                  treated like a functioning human being no matter what one looks
                  like, including respect). Discrimination comes in many forms.
                  But most important, to this old trial veteran and professor,
                  the light and funny movie actually demonstrates the importance
                  of hard work and fact investigation. For the astute, you will
                  see the seemingly one-track-minded Elle demonstrate her intellectual
                  prowess over her own domain early on-she knows her fabrics! And
                  think about how many murders turn on fiber analysis! For at least
                  this viewer, and former and proud LA resident, I will be more
                  careful of my regional and hair color prejudices, as should we
                  all. If you are a law student, law professor, resident of the
                  west coast or east, go see this movie and learn something as
                  you laugh at yourself!</font></p>
