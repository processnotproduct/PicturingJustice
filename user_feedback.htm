            </table><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Recently, PJ heard from
            a lawyer who was searching for a film to use in training his
            interns. Here is the question the lawyer posed:<br>
            I am at a non-profit public interest law firm. Many of our interns
            come expecting to do some glamorous work or spend their time
            researching really interesting legal points. They view with disdain
            having to review boxes of documents. I am looking for a film
            to show our interns at the beginning of the summer&#151;a film
            that will emphasize the role of careful fact development in a
            case.Your suggestion will be appreciated.</font></p>

            <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Some of the PJ editors put
            on their thinking caps and responded as follows:</font></b><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><br>
            My personal favorite is the Costa-Gavras film, &quot;<i>Z</i>&quot;.
            It shows how careful fact development can lead to the highest
            levels of government. [Rob Waring]<br>
            I think <i>A Civil Action</i> makes some good use of the importance
            of developing facts and the use of documents. [Paul Joseph] <br>
<br>
            The lawyer&#146;s question got us to thinking about the question
            of whether there were films which could be used to help train
            lawyers and whether there are any films which every lawyer should
            see?<br>
            We invite the readers of PJ to post their own suggestions for
            films that lawyers ought to see. Tell us the name of the film
            and why it should be &quot;required&quot; viewing for lawyers.

            On my list of must-see films for lawyers and law students are
            thefollowing: <i>Anatomy of a Murder</i>, valuable for the ethical
            questions and for the development of the defense.</font> <i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Witness for the Prosecution</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">, a lawyer with what looks like a losing

            &quot;Movies a lawyer should see&quot; and it goes like this:
            <i>Devil's Advocate</i> -every lawyer should see this one. This
            movie is a vivid depiction of the danger inherent in identifying
            yourself with your profession; it makes you think about your
            personal life in relation to the ractice of law, a thing that
            law school doesn't teach you and law firms never mention. This
            film forces you to realize and accept that you can't have brilliance
            in both.</font></p>

            There are a lot of fine suggestions...I would add these for your
            consideration: I was shown &quot;Gideon's Trumpet&quot; w/Henry
            Fonda in my crim. proc. class. It's got all sides in their, the
            client, the judges, and attorneys. The interactions remain timely
            and of course, it is about the Gideon Case, from whence all public
            interest grew. Most people haven't seen it. Also &quot;Presumed
            Innocent&quot; and &quot;The Witness,&quot; both w/Harrison Ford,
            and any of the John Grisham books on film. &quot;The Client&quot;
            with Susan Sarandon's Reggie Love is my personal favorite.These
            all bring the audience into the film and leaves them talking,
            too.The drawback is here, most people have seen these.There don't
            seem to be many with an ethnic star or voice yet, that isn't
            about police or investigators. I guess we'll just have to wait
            for those, but no doubt, they'll be as well done.</font></p>

            Question: I thought your site would have more on the interaction
            between the law (courts &amp; cases) and the media as in news
            T.V and print news. Do you have any articles on the above?<br>

            <font size="-1" face="Verdana">Graphical representations of the
            law and critical appraisals of same are scarce indeed and that
            seems perfectly all right considering the fact that law is primarily
            a written medium in our civilization.<br>
            This being said, the rest of the world still exists and it is
            with no surprise that we often see representations of the law,
            justice and the legal world in graphical form (paintings, cartoons,
            posters etc.).<br>
            In the videosphere, the corresponding arts are of course, movies
            and television. It is thus entirely fitting and of the utmost
            interest to collect many representations of justice in these
            media.<br>

            I enjoyed Picturing Justice and believe I might spend a good
            deal of time with it. I did some research a few years ago on
            images of civil liberties because I believe that with many of
            our liberties we have a picture in our mind, like the segregated
            lunch counter or the burning flag.<hr align="LEFT"><b>From: Anne

            I liked the web site for its witty commentary and critical analysis
            of the Hollywood version of the North American legal system.
            Despite being a senior member of the Bar in New Zealand I suspended
            disbelief and viewed the U.S. particularly as offering a shonky
            criminal justice legal system where rules were made to be broken.
            Just shows the power of the silver screen and O J Simpson.<br>
            John Grisham's novels have spawned a film industry and the comments
            of the reviewers on <i>A Time To Kill</i> and <i>The Rainmaker</i>
            deserve wider distribution. <i>A Time To Kill</i> contained a
            tangled message indeed and used a one-dimensional and stereotypical
            lawyer as the defense attorney. <i>The Rainmaker</i> has not
            yet been released here probably because <i>The Devil's Advocate</i>
            is playing and it is bad business to have too many lawyers as
            protagonists in films. Lawyers are unpopular here too.<hr align="LEFT"><b>From:

            I agree with your characterization of Ally McBeal as a &quot;relationship&quot;
            show and am also distressed that this is the way a woman lawyer
            who is finally worthy of her own show is presented. But I found
            even more to object to in at least the first episode. Not only
            is Ally more concerned with her relationships than her law practice
            and cynical about her job, but also she is portrayed as shallow,
            silly and easy to take advantage of. Sexual harassment, which
            is a workplace-related hazard that many young women face when
            moving into spheres of action that have been constructed and
            are still largely maintained by men, is introduced almost immediately
            in Ally's case&#151;only to be resolved by a) her departure from
            her first job and b) having her clever, cynical, greedy new boss
            bring the perpetrator to justice&#151;not Ally. Ally gets into
            ridiculous situations in the bathroom of her firm. And of course
            (of course!) she wears miniskirt-based suits. Sigh. Another opportunity
            wasted.<hr align="LEFT"><b>From: Michael Asimow</b>, UCLA Law School
            &lt;asimow at law.ucla.edu&gt;<br>
            In his review of <i>Ally McBeal</i>, John Denvir appropriately
            calls attention to the gross sexual stereotyping of the storyline.
            Interestingly, however, sexual stereotyping of female lawyers
            is far worse in film than on television.<br>
            In film, with the single exception of Adam's Rib, female lawyers
            are invariably portrayed in a negative light. Some are merely
            incompetent (Philadelphia, A Few Good Men). Some can't control
            their emotions (<i>In the Name of the Father</i>.) Most have
            appalling ethics; who could forget Maggie Ward in <i>Class Action</i>
            betraying her client by going over to the other side or Laura
            Fischer in <i>The Verdict</i> who functions as a sexual spy.
            Many female lawyers have disastrous taste in selecting sexual
            partners; <i>Jagged Edge</i> is one of numerous examples of female
            lawyers sleeping with their clients. Most have disastrous personal
            lives. In short, filmmakers invariably portray female lawyers
            in film in a shockingly negative light.<br>
            In television, however, the picture is far more balanced. <i>Ally
            McBeal</i> is somewhat exceptional, I think. Many (though not
            all) of the female lawyers on <i>L. A. Law</i> were admirable
            lawyers and human beings. Female lawyers are presented favorably
            on <i>The Practice</i> and <i>Law and Order</i>.<br>
            What accounts for the differences between female lawyers on film
            and TV? One difference, I believe, is that television is character-driven.
            People won't tune into a series every week to see repulsive characters;
            they need to identify with and like the people they invite into
            their living rooms. Film, however, is more plot-driven; viewers
            don't mind seeing repulsive people on the screen if they are
            part of a good story.<br>
            In addition, television has to be acceptable to commercial sponsors.
            Sponsors don't like too much stereotyping in entertainment products
            with which they're associated; it could trigger protests. My
            prediction is that <i>Ally McBeal </i>won't last long, but then
            it's often a mistake to overestimate the taste of TV viewers.</font></p>

            The First Amendment to Larry Flynt was the cost of doing business.
            A Nazi has the right to speak. Why not Larry Flynt? The film
            confused Flynt's motive with our right to speak freely. His lawyers
            made their best legal arguments. It is to our benefit that he
            won the case. He has the right to speak and make a living. Isn't
            the question why Hustler sells? (i.e. woman in meat grinder on
            cover) Why did Milos Foreman &amp; Oliver Stone portray Larry
            Flynt as a hero? Because he paid his lawyers?<hr align="LEFT"><b>From:

            <i>The Practice</i> is one my my favorite shows of all time.
            I have been paying attention to the credits on episodes I've
            seen, and usually the episodes have been written by the excellent
            David E. Kelley. The episode where Ellenor is sued by a hapless
            podiatrist for emotional distress when she refuses to go out
            with him was riveting.<br>
            The man playing the black lawyer (right now I can't think of
            his name) is one of the best actors on TV. I've seen him in guest
            shots on other shows, and he is always phenomenal.</font> <font size="-1" face="Verdana">I'm so glad that the show is not being
            cancelled. I hear that folks love <i>Ally McBeal</i>,and I find

            I wholeheartedly agree with Michael Asimow's suggestion that
            <i>The Practice</i> episode on the death penalty deserves an
            Emmy. I'd say it was more effective than <i>Dead Man Walking</i>.
            While Jimmy was great in that episode, I think his sweet shyness
            is starting to get a bit cloying. I would suggest the best character
            is Lara<br>
            Flynn Boyle as the sexually predatory acid-tongued prosecutor,
            a girl not at all like dear old mom.<hr align="LEFT"><b>From: Stacy

            My biggest dilemma this semester is how to get home from my Monday
            night class in time to watch <i>The Practice</i>. Almost every
            show raises an ethical issue which is worth chewing over. Although
            it is almost impossible to raise such issues without resorting
            to excesses in order to enhance the dramatic conflict, the core
            issues are always provocative.</font> <font size="-1" face="Verdana">I
            also think Eugene is the most skillful trial attorney ever depicted
            on T.V. His cross-exam of an eyewitness in a mugging was masterful
            and succinct. His United States of America summations are brilliant,
            and all the more so because the viewer is on to his trick. Finally,
            while the show was still on Saturdays at 10 PM, when those of
            us with no social life were first hooked, Eugene handled the
            case of a one-legged mugger who lied on the stand. This episode
            was a terrific example of how storytelling can be persuasive.
            Since the client told Euegene in mid-trial that his previous
            story had been a lie, Eugene had to put on a &quot;narrative&quot;
            direct. The defendant told a wonderful story about how people
            (the victim) refuse to look at homeless, one-legged beggars so
            naturally she wouldn't be able to tell him from his friend, the
            other one-legged beggar down the street. Catch it in reruns if
            you missed it.<br>

            The film <i>Brilliant Lies</i> was based on the play of the same
            name and is, in fact, very close to the original play being very
            &quot;stagey&quot; in its approach and almost word for word the
            same as the original. The only additions are the flashbacks which
            the audience is left to construct in the stage version. The characterizations,
            issues and<br>
            point of view are mostly accurate reflections of an Australian
            understanding of the problem.Your site is very good and as a
            teacher of media studies in Victoria, Australia I shall be recommending
            it to my students. BTW <i>Brilliant Lies</i> is currently being

            I commend Mr. Joseph for his willingness to treat <i>Ultima Online</i>
            (UO) seriously. I think <i>UO</i> raises even more interesting
            questions than Mr. Joseph mentions. For example: many player
            created &quot;guilds&quot; have come into existence. Are these
            guilds any less &quot;real&quot; than the &quot;Elks Lodge&quot;
            of Albany? Some players have acknowledged<br>
            another player as the &quot;Mayor&quot; of one city in the game
            (Ponfar the Mayor of Yew). Is he in fact the &quot;Mayor&quot;
            of this city?</font> <font size="-1" face="Verdana">Things exist
            in many ways (from administrative boundaries all the way to money
            itself) simply because a large group of people agree that they
            exist. Is it not possible that elements within this &quot;virtual
            reality&quot; could take on a meaning beyond that of the game?
            John Perry Barlow argued a year and a half ago that the Internet
            was &quot;independent&quot; from current governments. I can see
            a time when &quot;citizens&quot; of a virtual world based on
            the Internet will hold more allegiance to their virtual world,
            than they do to their current &quot;physical&quot; residence.
            Will they be right in some meaningful sense?<hr align="LEFT"><b>From:

            I am an avid <i>UO</i> player, who has been seriously disappointed

            player in the game. I am thrilled that someone else has noticed
            this... believe me I wish that there was some way to enforce
            better conduct besides just asking people to help &quot;gang&quot;
            up on the more infamous of killers. I have had several bad experiences
            on <i>UO</i> and am considering canceling my account because
            they (unethical players) are getting so far out of hand. So far
            I have encountered con men, thieves, liars, and killers. I am
            disgusted with the lack of consequence that these actions have...<br>

            Another older game to check online is Meridian 59, which faced
            related violent behavior to <i>UO</i>. The guardians merely removed
            rampant killers from playing the game rather than dealing with
            their avatars inside game play. The same held for other types
            of persistent hassling. The good vigilante groups popped up immediately
            at M59, as well as a tendency for male players to choose female
            avatars. This came from an observed pattern that females were
            less likely to be instantly attacked - conversation was almost
            always the initial behavior. This protected &quot;good behavior&quot;
            newbies &amp; provided &quot;bad behavior&quot; vets with a disarming
            moment to attack them! Don't know M59's current state 'cause

            Nice site. Rob Waring says that Justice Joseph Story doesn't
            include JQA's arguments before the court because &quot;he failed
            to submit it.&quot; JQA did publish them separately. (Reprinted
            in 1968 or 1969 by Arco.)<br>
            Howard Jones in his definitive study of the <i>Amistad</i> case
            (Oxford, 1989; rev. 1997), writes that Story dismissed JQA's
            arguments (as irrelevant, per Jones) and used Baldwin's strictly
            legal arguments to arrive at his decision. It's hard to believe
            that justices like Taney would [have] accept[ed] Story's decision
            if he had used JQA's arguments. Read Jones, who used Story's

            Just a small comment regarding the discussion of <i>Amistad</i>.
            At several points, the commentator refers to the film as having
            a &quot;happy ending&quot;. It is important to recall that when
            the main character returned to his village in Sierra Leone, he
            found that it had been destroyed and his family killed in an
            internal conflict. I thought <i>Amistad</i> was a great movie
            about slavery and about the legal system, but it certainly didn't
            have a happy ending.<hr align="LEFT"><b>From: Bill and Joan Coleman</b>
