                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">NBC has launched its newest
                  legal show, <i>A.U.S.A</i>. (short for <i>Assistant United States
                  Attorneys</i>), a sitcom about newly minted federal prosecutors
                  in New York City, although it seems to be primarily a vehicle
                  for the star, Scott Foley, perhaps a starring role payoff for
                  his secondary role on the long running <i>Felicity</i>.  <i>A.U.S.A.</i>
                   recycles every stereotype we've seen in the past five years
                  or longer of legal dramas and comedies, reaching back to Life's
                  Work for the clumsy, clueless protagonist (although Scott Foley
                  as Adam Sullivan is still a smarter and more competent lawyer
                  than Lisa Ann Walter as Lisa Ann Hunter, which isn't saying much),
                  <i>Ally McBeal</i> for the bathroom events, and <i>Night Court</i>
                  for the hostile top dog prosecutor (Peter Jacobson's Geoffrey
                  Lawrence though equally ambitious is clearly a more savvy attorney
                  than John LaRoquette's Dan Fielding).  We don't see much of Sullivan's
                  colleague Ana Rivera (Ana Ortiz) as the savvy former cop turned
                  prosecutor in the first episode, but the back story suggests
                  that she is more competent and more street smart than Adam. 
                  In addition, the laugh track is annoying and intrusive, and it
                  accompanies lines and actions that don't always merit guffaws.
                   We do escape one frequent clich&eacute; in the pilot, however.
                  Amanda Detmer as the public defender Susan Rakoff  is smart,
                  compassionate and competent. That won't last long. According
                  to received television wisdom, able female attorneys are not
                  funny. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/ausa.jpg" width="121" height="181" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Nor is the pilot episode, which
                  aired Tuesday night after <i>Frasier</i>, particularly hilarious
                  and NBC spoils its attraction by showing the best bits in its
                  promos. Sullivan injures himself while learning to fire an AK47
                  (which annoys the ATF guy in charge of teaching him). He gets
                  water on his pants and tries to dry them with the hand dryer
                  while using the judges' bathroom (which annoys them, particularly
                  the one hearing his case).  He shows up late on his first day
                  at a job that he claims he has &quot;busted his ass for&quot;
                  for six years, a tardiness which annoys his new boss and the
                  boss' cranky secretary. Think she's cranky because she spends
                  so much time with lawyers? I think she's cranky because she's
                  trapped in this sitcom. <br>
<br>
                  In a really bad career move, Adam makes a date with one of the
                  jurors in his boss's case. To be fair, it isn't entirely his
                  fault. His roommate introduced them at the courthouse. By contrast
                  with the roommate, Sullivan is a brilliant guy.  Why these two
                  are friends is complete mystery. Sullivan eventually shows some
                  compassion and some political smarts by deciding to drop the
                  prosecution of a Tuskegee Airman charged with cashing his dead
                  wife's Social Security checks in order to pay for her funeral.
                   He also tries to explain jury tampering to his buddy, which
                  is a futile maneuver. But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br>
<br>
                  By making the date mentioned above with the juror, Sullivan becomes
                  the reason for a mistrial. His new boss is furious, but the laugh
                  track encourages us to giggle uncontrollably. The boss must be
                  able to hear us. He forgives Adam and gives him his first case-the
                  prosecution of this retired soldier and war hero. The war hero
                  appears in court and before Sullivan can begin his case, tells
                  the judge he is ready to plead guilty. Then Rakoff gives the
                  court a rundown of his accomplishments.  She and her client look
                  good. Sullivan looks bad. The judge (from the bathroom incident)
                  looks annoyed and disgusted. Sullivan leaves the courtroom in
                  disarray. He discusses the case with his incompetent paralegal,
                  Wally (John Ross Bowie).  He decides to dismiss the charges,
                  though his boss doesn't like the idea. He returns to court, only
                  to discover that the defendant was injured in the courthouse
                  tackling a thief and is now in the hospital recuperating from
                  a broken hip. Sullivan visits him and is unfunnily and unceremoniously
                  escorted out by two of the defendant's Tuskegee colleagues, both
                  in their late seventies.  Their dignity saves the scene from
                  being hopelessly trite but Sullivan looks pathetic. <br>
<br>
                  A comedy about lawyers could be very amusing.  This show's pedigree
                  should have ensured that it is. Its creator, Rich Appel, was
                  a federal prosecutor before he turned to writing, and he has
                  written some good material, especially for <i>The Simpsons</i>.
                  Scott Foley, who starred in <i>Felicity</i>, is a good actor.
                  His colleagues make up a capable ensemble.  But the characters
                  don't really come together. <i>A.U.S.A.</i> doesn't seem destined
                  to be an ensemble show, like its lead-in Frasier. Its jokes are
                  stale, and delivered with absolutely no style. What magnifies
                  its faults further is that the network gave the show's creators
                  some extra time to redo things which it asked that instead of
                  filming the series with a single camera, they reshoot using multiple
                  cameras. The additional time should have cued Appel and his associates
                  to rethink some other aspects of the show. <br>
<br>
                  Like so many law series, <i>A.U.S.A.</i> sacrifices opportunities
                  to talk seriously yet amusingly about the law for cheap laughs
                  at the profession's expense. Instead of using the financial plight
                  of the retired to make some memorable points about how our society
                  treats its elderly and its veterans, it insults both those victims
                  and its audience, especially with its use of slapstick humor.
                  The elderly, the disabled and veterans who can't make ends meet
                  on their Social Security is not a funny subject, you object?
                   Absolutely true, but I didn't choose the topic. <br>
                   <br>
                  More than this I cannot say; the show doesn't offer much more,
                  at least not yet. I had planned to try to catch the second episode,
                  but missed it, and have lost any enthusiasm for watching the
                  third. I am very disappointed in this new series. I was ready
                  for a clever, smart, pointed legal satire. My verdict: unless
                  it develops a likeable and distinct personality and some new
                  approaches, <i>A.U.S.A.</i> will disappear quickly from NBC's
                  lineup, to be replaced by some other lightweight and equally
                  forgettable series.<br>
