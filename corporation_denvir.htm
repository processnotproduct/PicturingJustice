            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by John Denvir</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Most &quot;lawyer films&quot;
            pit the idealistic lone practitioner against the evil system.
             <i>Young Mr. Lincoln</i> is an early example of the genre. But
            in reality most lawyers now work for corporations or large law
            firms that operate like corporations.  In this context ethical
            questions arise that do not confront the single practitioner
            who must only decide whether to take the client and then how
            to zealously advocate on his or her behalf. When the lawyer is
            employed by the corporation the distinction between lawyer and
            client begins to erode and problems arise.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">One problem is what moral responsibility
            does the employee lawyer have for unethical acts committed by
            the corporation. I don't mean just situations like in the  <i>The
            Firm</i> or <i>Changing Lanes</i> where the employer asks lawyers
            to commit unethical acts, but moral responsibility for actions
            the lawyer is not directly involved in, but profits from as a
            member of the organization. </font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/sunshine state.jpg" width="100" height="142" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">I
            don't know any lawyer films that raise this issue, but it is
            presented well in another context by John Sayles' <i>Sunshine
            State</i>.  Jack Meadows (Timothy Hutton) is a landscape architect
            employed by Plantation Estates, a real estate development corporation
            that wishes to build a luxury residential complex on an island
            off the coast of Florida.  To accomplish this goal, the corporation
            uses a variety of tactics, some proper, some ethically dubious,
            and some clearly illegal.  One legal, but sleazy, method is to
            recruit an African-American former local football star to front
            for them in the purchase of land in an African-American community.
             The locals think they are getting the star as a neighbor, but
            actually the properties purchased are going to be included in
            the new development that will replace their community.  One clearly
            illegal tactic is to bribe the Chair of the local city council
            to get necessary city approvals.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Of course, Meadows, the low
            key landscape architect, is not directly connected to any of
            these devious schemes.  He just &quot;moves dirt around&quot;
            as he explains to his romantic interest, Marly Temple(Edie Falco).
             Jack is an American success story; he comes from a poor family
            (his father was a gardener on some rich guy's estate in  Newport)
            and has risen to be a very highly regarded landscape architect,
            going around the country turning wilderness into lush gardens
            in Plantation Estates' various projects. We have no reason to
            hold him responsible for his employer's unethical and illegal
            methods of acquiring the land he later beautifies. He's just
            a professional doing his thing.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But as the plot develops we
            start to question whether Jack is as innocent as he seems. Meadows
            tells  Marly that  landscape architecture was not his first career;
            he went to business school after college and had a successful
            career &quot;buying and selling corporations&quot; until his
            boss went to jail for fraud and Meadows re-evaluated his career
            choices.  So the apparently naive Meadows actually is quite conversant
            with corporate shenanigans. Also it turns out that he not only
            landscapes the project, but is also willing to help the sales
            people to &quot;romance&quot; a prospective client when necessary.
            The divide between corporate departments is not as clear as first
            thought.  One starts to wonder exactly how much Jack knows about
            Plantation Estates business methods.  </font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Or, how much he chooses not
            to know.  Social scientists tell us that we all are subject to
            &quot;cognitive dissonance,&quot; the tendency to ignore information
            that does not conform to our preferred beliefs.  Maybe Jack doesn't
            know more because at some level he knows that such knowledge
            would contradict the image of  Plantation Estates he prefers
            to hold. For instance, he assures Marly that  Plantation Estates
            is not a sleazy operation like a lot of real estate development
            corporations, although the viewer knows the corporation is at
            least as sleazy as the competition. Is his a case of voluntary
            ignorance?</font></p>

            <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sunshine State</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> raises another troubling issue that
            I think relates to lawyers as well as landscape architects, the
            temptation for an employee to downsize his or her professional
            ideals to meet the employers' values. On one of their first dates,
            Jack rhapsodizes about his pride in being a landscape architect,
            a profession he proudly tells her that dates back to when the
            great  Frederick Law Olmstead dedicated himself to bringing nature
            to the urban masses in projects like New York's Central Park.
            But Marly rather rudely interrupts him to point out that landscaping
            gated communities for the rich doesn't sound like bringing nature
            to the masses. Meadows can only lamely concede that the &quot;populist
            element&quot; has disappeared. Maybe, despite his corporate title
            and high salary, Jack ended up just like his dad, a gardener
            for rich people.  </font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Supreme Court has assured
            us that corporations are &quot;persons&quot;, but if this so,
            they are very greedy persons.  The corporation's sole reason
            for existence is to produce profit. I remember hearing an interview
            with the president of an American auto company in which he pointed
            out that his corporation's real product was profit; cars were
            just a means to that end.  In fact, I imagine that one could
            make a plausible argument that it is the corporation's moral
            duty to its shareholders to maximize its return on capital.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">While we should not minimize
            the very real  benefits to society that are the indirect results
            of the corporation's obsessive search for profit, neither should
            we blind ourselves to other less helpful side-effects.  One little
            discussed side-effect is the corporation's effect on the ideals
            of its employees. Like Jack, they might see part of their original
            vision somehow disappear. And if we extend this form of &quot;cognitive
            dissonance&quot;-the tendency to shape our personal ideals to
            meet our professional role- to all the lawyers who work for corporations,
            the societal loss of idealism becomes enormous.<br>
               <br>
            Of course the corporate form is not going to go away and lawyers
            do have a legitimate need to earn a living. Maybe the lesson
            to take away from the plight of Jack Meadows is not revolution
            or despair, but a realization that organizational forms are not
            neutral and that working for a group complicates matters.  One
            strategy would be to work internally to reform the organization
            to better reflect your ideals, although it must be recognized
            that organizations are not eager for reform or friendly to internal
            reformers.  And if that doesn't work, you can always open your
            own law office. Like Honest Abe.<br>
