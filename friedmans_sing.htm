                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Andrew Jarecki's documentary,
                  <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i>, is a brilliant investigation
                  of the concept of &quot;credibility.&quot; We all agree that
                  honesty is a cherished value that is embedded deeply in our culture.
                  Without honesty, we would be unable to come to a conclusion on
                  many matters because we can't be present at all places at all
                  times. As a result, we must rely on the words of others. The
                  underlying value of honesty is in its ability to allow us to
                  trust, or distrust, statements made by another party about these
                  events. In some situations, one might be unable to grasp what
                  the &quot;truth&quot; is or determine who is telling the truth.
                  This is the dilemma that <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i> confronts.<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/friedman3.jpg" width="167" height="131" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><i>Capturing the Friedmans</i>
                  is a film that consists of numerous interviews, home videos and
                  snippets of news coverage from 1987 about the Friedman family
                  of Great Neck, New York. The father, Arnold Friedman, and his
                  youngest son, Jesse, were both alleged to have molested numerous
                  young male students enrolled in their computer class. The details
                  surrounding the charges constantly conflict with one another
                  throughout the film. At the end of the day, the viewer would
                  be left wondering what really happened in those computer classes
                  and who was telling the truth. <br>
<br>
                  To better understand how we, as viewers, draw our conclusions
                  as to what the &quot;truth&quot; is, it is essential to understand
                  how we make judgments of credibility. There are four major factors
                  that assist us to evaluate whether a statement or information
                  given to us is true. The four factors are as follows:<br>
<br>
                  </font><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
                    <tr>
                      <td width="100%">
                        <blockquote><font size="-1" face="Verdana">1. What the message
                          is about,<br>
                          2. Who is telling the message,<br>
                          3. How the message is being told, and <br>
                          4. How much you know about the subject matter.</font>&nbsp;</blockquote>
                      </td>
                    </tr>
                  </table><font size="-1" face="Verdana">To begin, an important
                  aspect in evaluating a statement is the content of the message.
                  If a statement sounds outrageous and unrealistic, the recipient
                  of the message would most likely disregard the statement because
                  there is minimal, if any, value or truth to it. For example,
                  in <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i>, the police stated that there
                  was pornography everywhere in the house and that the pornography
                  magazines were not hidden. It is difficult for a viewer to accept
                  this statement because it sounds ridiculous that pornography
                  would be highly visible around the house. If that is the case,
                  one wonders why haven't the parents noticed the magazines when
                  they picked their children up from their computer classes? Therefore,
                  if a statement sounds far-fetched, it is unlikely that one will
                  believe the statement.<br>
<br>
                  However, if there is a doubt to the truth of its content, the
                  person delivering the message can be influential to one's decision.
                  For example, if the person communicating the message has a reputation
                  of being honest and reliable, I would probably believe her statement
                  over the same message given by a habitual liar. One might also
                  believe a statement given by a person of authority. For example,
                  when the judge and the police believed that Arnold and Jesse
                  were guilty, one might be more inclined to conclude that they
                  were guilty as well. Hence, the status and the reputation of
                  the person making the statement are important criteria that we
                  rely on when we evaluate the credibility of a statement.<br>
<br>
                  In <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i>, there were numerous sources
                  of information and various people commenting on Arnold and Jesse.
                  Based on their different standpoints, one might draw different
                  conclusions from their statements. The primary people who provided
                  commentaries in the film were the accused themselves and their
                  family members. When Arnold's wife, Elaine, was under pressure
                  by her sons to say that Arnold was innocent and when time after
                  time she refused to do so, one might conclude that Arnold was
                  probably guilty. This is because the viewer expects the last
                  person to provide negative statements about the accused to be
                  his wife. Conversely, the viewer may also be skeptical at comments
                  provided by people who are close to the accused or comments given
                  by the accused himself. For example, the viewer might conclude
                  that Jesse's brother, David, and Arnold's brother, Howard, were
                  merely vouching for their family. Therefore, one might expect
                  bias in their statements and as a result, view their statements
                  to be unreliable.<br>
<br>
                  On the other hand, viewers may be convinced if they were given
                  the information by the media. The media is capable of influencing
                  our view of the world and what we perceive to be true. Thus applying
                  this concept to <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i>, the extensive
                  news coverage on the Friedman case has the ability to influence
                  the community, including the judge and many parents, that Arnold
                  and Jesse are pedophiles and sexual offenders. <br>
<br>
                  The form in which the message is being publicized through the
                  media will also have an impact to the reliability of the statement.
                  In other words, the medium of communication chosen has an effect
                  on the strength of the statement. For example, would you believe
                  a witness if you heard his oral testimony? Perhaps. Would you
                  be more influenced if you not only heard the witness' testimony,
                  but was also given a photograph to support what he was saying?
                  Most likely, you would have a more affirmative answer as to whether
                  you believe or disbelieve the witness' story. It is more convincing
                  to the recipient when there are visual images, such as photographs
                  and videos, to enhance or verify a statement. <br>
<br>
                  In my opinion, the home videos shown in <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i>
                  revealing the close father-son relationship between Arnold and
                  his three sons and also David's &quot;private&quot; recording
                  of himself raving about the accusations against his father and
                  brother were highly convincing evidence of Arnold and Jesse's
                  innocence. This is because home videos are generally seen to
                  be authentic. The people being videotaped tend to put their masks
                  down and are their true selves because most of the time, they
                  feel comfortable with the person who is holding the camera. There
                  is also an unspoken expectation that the home videos are to be
                  privately viewed amongst family and friends and not by the public.
                  Therefore, there is no reason for a person to lie in a home video.
                  This is precisely why viewers may question whether Arnold and
                  Jesse did commit such horrible crimes because the home videos
                  seem to favour their innocence.<br>
<br>
                  Finally, the amount of knowledge viewers have on the subject
                  matter will have an effect on the ultimate decision of whether
                  to believe a statement or not. Generally, the more you know about
                  a subject matter, the better you are able to assess the credibility
                  of a statement. However, there appears to be an exception for
                  <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i>. It was nearly impossible to have
                  a concrete conclusion from the film as to what truly happened.
                  In fact, the viewer's opinion and conclusion constantly changes
                  as new evidence surfaces. For that reason, credibility is a concept
                  that is not permanent and is capable of changing depending on
                  the amount of information known at a certain point in time. For
                  example, when Howard insisted that Arnold never had sexual relations
                  with him when they were younger, I was convinced by him until
                  the camera moved back and showed Howard's partner sitting beside
                  him. Then one wonders how truthful Howard was and how the revelation
                  of Howard's sexual preference changed the viewer's decision.
                  Perhaps Howard's sexuality inferred that a sexual relationship
                  between Howard and Arnold (as described in Arnold's letter to
                  Debbie) was possible and was not completely unrealistic. Therefore,
                  the additional information of Howard's sexual preference has
                  the power to change our views on an issue and as a result, it
                  caused my suspicion of Howard's story.<br>
<br>
                  The amount of information the recipient has, the method of communication,
                  the messenger delivering the statement and the substance of the
                  message are four aspects that are interrelated and are all at
                  play together when we make judgments of credibility. In addition,
                  we also decide what is credible based on personal beliefs and
                  possibly make judgments based on what we want to believe rather
                  than what the evidence points to. Therefore, it is important
                  to take note of our own bias when we make judgments of credibility.
                  For example, when I compared the two former computer students'
                  testimonies in the film, I was swayed to accept one statement
                  over the other partly because of the difference in their physical
                  appearance. The former computer student sitting in an office
                  wearing business attire appeared more credible than the other
                  former computer student lying on his coach in his casual T-shirt
                  and shorts at home. As commonly known, appearances may be deceiving.
                  It is possible that the former computer student with the casual
                  attire was truthful whereas the other former student was not.
                  Hence, one must be careful not to allow personal bias to play
                  a highly influential factor when we make important decisions,
                  especially when a person's liberty is at stake. <br>
<br>
                  Overall, there are many factors simultaneously influencing our
                  judgments of credibility. Our perception of what is &quot;true&quot;
                  may change throughout time as we, ourselves, change and as new
                  information arises. In <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i>, the viewer
                  will most likely leave the theatre wondering whether they will
                  ever know what the truth is and whether there is more information
                  for them to uncover. Whichever conclusion one might draw from
                  the film, it is probably just as good of a guess as mine. <br>
