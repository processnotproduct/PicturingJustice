                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Paul R Joseph</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">*Note: This article contains
                  &quot;spoilers.&quot; Do not read until you have seen the film.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At the end of the recent film,
                  <i>Minority Report</i>, the Pre-Crime experiment is disbanded.
                  The immediate reasons seem to be two: first, the existence of
                  &quot;minority reports&quot; (occasions when one of the three
                  Pre-Cogs has a different image of events than the other two)
                  indicates that not all Pre-Crime suspects will actually kill
                  as predicted; and second, it is possible, with deep inside knowledge
                  of the system, to fool it by &quot;hiding&quot; a murder so that
                  it will be read as a &quot;deja vu&quot; Pre-Cog reading and
                  discarded. Neither reason supports the elimination of the unit
                  and the film's conclusion may give an erroneous impression about
                  the accuracy of our own criminal justice system.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/minorityreport2.jpg" width="219" height="148" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Let's
                  be clear. Both reasons for disbanding the Pre-Crime unit essentially
                  boil down to the fact that the system is not perfect. Either
                  an innocent will be punished for a crime he would not have committed,
                  or a guilty person may elude detection.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The very same objections can
                  be made about our own system. True, we do not attempt to punish
                  crimes before they occur; rather, we generally know that a crime
                  has taken place. What we don't know is whether the defendant
                  is the person who committed the acts in question (and, of course,
                  we must often judge the state of mind of the defendant at the
                  time he acted). The trial mechanism is intended to resolve these
                  issues but we do not require that the resolution rest on absolute
                  proof to the exclusion of any other possibility. The &quot;reasonable
                  doubt&quot; standard is a high one but it falls short of requiring
                  absolute certainty. As a standard jury instruction puts it (in
                  part), &quot;A reasonable doubt is not a mere possible doubt,
                  a speculative, imaginary or forced doubt.&quot; (Section 3.7,
                  Florida Standard Jury Instructions in Criminal Cases, Fourth
                  Edition, 2002). Because absolute proof is not possible, we do
                  not require it. We label such &quot;well, there is always a possibility
                  that he's innocent no matter what the evidence&quot;as &quot;unreasonable
                  doubt&quot; and we tell the jury to convict.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In essence, we accept an error
                  rate-we know that some- but very few-- innocents will be condemned.
                  It is only when the error rate appears to be larger than what
                  is &quot;acceptable&quot; that we become alarmed. Something like
                  this crisis of confidence is now brewing with regard to the death
                  penalty as the number of accounts of innocents condemned to die
                  swell, leading to moratoria and calls for reform or even abolition
                  of this impossible-to-correct punishment. In <i>Minority Report</i>,
                  the &quot;error&quot; rate seems very low-certainly lower than
                  in our own very real legal system. Further, the error rate could
                  be cut down significantly by not condemning in any case for which
                  there is a &quot;minority report.&quot; And, since the condemned
                  in <i>Minority Report</i> are not executed but merely kept in
                  stasis, there is always the ability to release a person determined
                  to have been wrongly accused.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It is also not a strong case
                  for abandonment of the project that its founder was able to conceal
                  his own crime. First, this appears to be the only such case in
                  the history of the Pre-Crime Unit and it is clear that only someone
                  with an intimate knowledge of the workings of the system could
                  have pulled the deception off, even for a short time. The glitch
                  in the system, that &quot;deja vu&quot; visions of murders were
                  routinely erased, would certainly have been corrected.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In our own criminal justice
                  reality, we have become aware that sometimes cops go bad. They
                  lie, they steal, they cheat and they frame innocents for crimes.
                  Scandals in the New Orleans Police Department and the Ramparts
                  division in Los Angeles are not unique. We know this but we do
                  not call for the abolition of all police departments. Rather,
                  we investigate allegations of wrongdoing, sometimes prosecute
                  bad cops, maintain &quot;internal affairs&quot; divisions, look
                  for systemic ways to further professionalize police, etc. All
                  in all, the Pre-Crime unit in <i>Minority Report</i> doesn't
                  seem like a likely candidate for closure on the grounds of corruption.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Perhaps the problem with Pre-Crime
                  is its premise, that we punish what might happen rather than
                  what has happened. Certainly, the idea of punishing thoughts
                  is abhorrent to any society that believes in freedom. What is
                  in our minds is our most private and intimate domain.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But Pre-Crime does not purport
                  to punish mere thought. Rather, the premise is that the Pre-Cogs
                  see the future-or at least, as we come to learn, the very likely
                  future. Even here, it isn't so clear that our own criminal justice
                  system does not have at least some parallels to the Pre-Crime
                  approach portrayed in <i>Minority Report</i>. Consider two examples:
                  conspiracy and preventive detention.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Conspiracy is really an agreement
                  among persons to commit a crime. The District of Columbia, where
                  Pre-Crime operated in <i>Minority Report</i>, requires some overt
                  act be committed towards achieving the criminal goal but it need
                  not be committed by the particular defendant. Acts of each conspirator
                  are attributed to all other members of the conspiracy. The underlying
                  crime need not actually be committed. Thus, a defendant could
                  be charged with conspiracy to commit murder even though the murder
                  never takes place and even when the plot did not evolve to a
                  stage where the conspirators could be charged with an attempt.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Although we define conspiracy
                  itself as a separate criminal offense, which means that we do
                  not have to deal directly with the issue in <i>Minority Report</i>,
                  it could be argued that there is a near parallel between criminal
                  liability for conspiracy and holding people accountable for crimes
                  they would very likely have committed unless arrested. In both
                  cases, society has found a way to hold people to account for
                  their intended and likely future wrongful acts without the necessity
                  of waiting until the act has actually come to pass.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In bail hearings, judges routinely
                  calculate the likelihood that the defendant will appear at trial
                  and deny bail when the defendant is a &quot;flight risk.&quot;
                  This form of preventive detention is applied because the judge
                  has calculated that the defendant is likely to flee in the future
                  and therefore can be held in jail now to assure his appearance.
                  While we staunchly deny that this jail term is &quot;punishment,&quot;
                  it is unlikely that the incarcerated person takes much comfort
                  in that. Jail is jail whatever label we put on it.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There is a growing belief that
                  some violent sex offenders suffer from some sort of personality
                  disorder or mental condition and that this produces a high probability
                  that they will repeat their crimes. In response to this, some
                  states have passed violent sexual predator laws (The Florida
                  version is called the Jimmy Ryce Act and can be found at FL ST
                  Section 394.910 et. seq. ) Under these laws, the person in question
                  (generally someone already incarcerated for a past crime but
                  shortly to be released), upon appropriate legal findings, can
                  be civilly committed for an unlimited term in a secure treatment
                  facility until such time, if ever, that the person is no longer
                  a danger to others. Because the process is civil rather than
                  criminal-that is, its purpose is not punishment-- the statutes
                  artfully dodge the &quot;punishment for future crime&quot; issue
                  directly faced in <i>Minority Report</i> [the civil nature of
                  the commitment also avoids many of the Constitutional protections
                  which would apply to a punitive regime. See, for example, Seling
                  v. Young, 121 S.Ct. 727 (2001)], but the result is much the same.
                  A person found likely to commit particularly serious future crimes
                  is involuntarily removed from society primarily due to a prediction
                  of future crimes the individual may (or may not) commit.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">While we do not yet claim to
                  punish criminals before they commit crimes, the core concept
                  of <i>Minority Report</i>, that predicted future criminal conduct
                  is sufficient grounds for locking a person up, may be closer
                  to realization in the real world than some might suppose. If
                  anything, the Pre-Crime process shown in the film probably has
                  fewer errors and better predictive value than analogous parts
                  of our own system.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Minority Report</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> ends with the abolition of the Pre-Crime
                  unit. It is just too dangerous and too error prone to be allowed
                  to function. We come to realize that there is something deeply
                  troubling about locking people up for what they may do in the
                  future. If those views are right, then perhaps there are parts
                  of our own system that should be carefully reexamined.</font></p>
