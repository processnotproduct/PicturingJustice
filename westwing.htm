    West Wing</i> </strong></font></p>
    <p align="CENTER"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>By Chris Jackson</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ratings and Golden Globe
    nominations make it official. NBC&#146;s <i>The West Wing</i> has the voters&#146;
    approval as THE SHOW to watch. And why not? Writer Aaron Sorkin has whipped up a show with
    razor sharp dialogue, engaging story lines, and carefully orchestrated ensemble acting.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Its fine dramatic quality
    aside, <i>The West Wing</i> commands our attention here in <i>Picturing Justice</i> for a
    number of reasons. The legal profession features prominently on<img src="images/westwing-j.JPG" alt="westwing-j.JPG (31628 bytes)" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="326" height="238"> the resume of many of the
    show&#146;s characters. They struggle with ethical dilemmas and present diverse
    perspectives on thorny current issues. We&#146;re also afforded an intriguing look at how
    ideas become policy and how a bill becomes law. We see research, planning, and compromise.
    We see close-up how people make laws and sometimes end up breaking lawmakers.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most significantly, however,
    is the show&#146;s inaugural one TV season before an election year. As popular culture,
    this portrait of President Josiah Bartlet (Martin Sheen) and his staff is clearly a
    Democrat&#146;s wish fulfillment. Small screen images of &quot;reality&quot; unsettled us
    as a country: a young girl in a beret, a stammering President, impeachment hearings.
    It&#146;s only natural that television should put Humpty back together again. <i>The West
    Wing</i> allows the country a quiet healing after the scandals of the Clinton
    administration. Its presentation of well-intended, intelligent professionals doing battle
    for good is a balm over our collective psyche.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Popular culture may have a
    better opportunity to shape political opinions than actual events. In <i>Why Americans
    Hate Politics</i> (1992), E. J. Dionne, Jr. illustrates the American public&#146;s growing
    disenchantment with the political process. As one reason, Dionne cites the two-party
    penchant for misrepresenting policy issues. However, we also must consider how most of us
    learn about events Washingtonian. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; TV and print news seems to
    pelt us with coverage, but ultimately our view of what&#146;s really going on is limited.
    CSPAN affords another look at official Washington, but the tedium alone is a killer. All
    the drama and risk happens off the speaker&#146;s dais. Nonfiction literature can present
    an in-depth view of events, but memoirs and biographies reach us long after the fact. They
    must. Revealing too much too soon incurs a high political risk. Films are better mirrors,
    even if they are funhouse mirrors, of what people think of Washington at the time they
    think it. Let&#146;s take a peek.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Presidents in films range from
    being ruthless to charming and many degrees in between.<i> Seven Days in May</i> (1964)
    shows the President, played by Frederic March, fending off a military takeover. Although
    March&#146;s character prevails, this film shows the vulnerability of the Presidency. Made
    during escalated fighting in Vietnam, the film reflects a public&#146;s fear that a
    military coup was not beyond the realm of possibility. </small></font></p>
    <i><p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>Dave</small></font></i> (1993) <p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small><em>Dave</em> (1993) features Kevin Kline
    as a two-in-one President. He plays both a <i><img src="images/dave.JPG" alt="dave.JPG (43051 bytes)" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="187" height="328"></i>Machiavellian leader, then a flannel
    shirt wearing lookalike who fills in for the comatose Prez. Only First Lady Sigourney
    Weaver tips to the deception. What better way to capture for the public mind the
    transition from a Republican White House to one under Democrat rule?</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>Based on the Clancy novel, <i>Clear and
    Present Danger </i>(1994) revives the elder statesman Presidential image. Harrison
    Ford&#146;s Jack Ryan reports to a corrupt President in bed with corporations and willing
    to authorize cover-ups. This film comes in the wake of Iran/Contra and other covert
    operations. These transgressions were never fully explained to the public satisfaction.
    &quot;Mistakes were made.&quot;</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The President dating? Okay, we
    can imagine it now, but five years ago, the idea felt new. <i>The American President</i>
    (1995) shows us widower Prez Michael Douglas and lobbyist Annette Bening in a convincing
    White House romance complete with conflicts of interest. Portraying a humanized leader,
    this film was an internship, so to speak, for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The young guy as Prez
    continues with Bill Paxton&#146;s turn as Commander in Chief for <i>Independence Day</i>
    (1996). A skilled fighter pilot, he and Will Smith send those evil extraterrestrials
    packing. In <i>Air Force One</i> (1997), Harrison Ford doesn&#146;t report to the
    President; he is the Big Guy himself. Ford is lithe and impressive as an action hero who
    saves his family and staff from terrorists. Both movies may reflect a public
    disappointment in Clinton&#146;s missing military background. Otherwise, these
    presidential portraits are a liberal&#146;s dream.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the dream fades. Joe
    Klein&#146;s <i>Primary Colors</i> was one book that didn&#146;t wait long enough to
    tell-all about mud on the campaign trail. The film based on Klein&#146;s book (1998) was
    released a week after Clinton&#146;s deposition on the Paula Jones case. It gives us John
    Travolta as Southern-inflected candidate Jack Stanton. He is soft and gooey, like the
    donuts he mashes into his face. In 1997-1998, <i>Murder at</i> <i>1600, Absolute Power, </i>and
    <i>Wag the Dog</i> follow in quick succession. All three reek with scandal and wrongdoing
    at the Top.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike film, the small screen
    is overwhelmed with Presidential reality, press conferences, sound bites, photo ops.
    Before <i>The West Wing</i>, presidential parody was the best TV could offer. Nixon
    appeared on <i>Laugh-In</i> and every President since then showed up some way or other on <i>Saturday
    Night Live</i>. <i>Benson </i>was a long-running sitcom during a time of growing political
    influence for minorities. <i>Hearts Afire,</i> written by MFOBs (Major Friends of Bill)
    Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth, lasted only a season or two. Showing the daily
    struggles of a Washington staff, the show is closest in spirit to Sorkin&#146;s <i>The
    West Wing</i>.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; From the outset<i>, The West
    Wing</i> sets a disclaimer: We are fiction. Opening credits show a filmy flag waving
    across an image of the White House. The theme music is by W.G. Snuffy Walden. Stirring,
    stately, with lots of brass, I thought the tune vaguely Copland-esque the first time I
    heard it. Now it seems more like the theme from <i>Wagon Train</i>. &quot;Westward ho!
    Round up those dogies.&quot; We&#146;re supposed to be in mythic territory here.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#146;t buy this little
    ruse for a second. When <i>Primary Colors</i> first came out, all Washington had fun
    aligning fiction with fact. We can play a similar game here. Analogies to the Clinton
    White House are inescapable.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Big Two are Josiah, called
    Jed, Bartlet (Sheen) and wife Abigail (Stockard Channing). They are both personally
    charming, but consummate, hardheaded politicians. They know how to work the room and the
    system. Sound familiar?</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bartlet, or POTUS (President
    of the United States), is brilliant and capable, a Nobel Prize Winner in Economics, but we
    see his flaws. Great in the role, Sheen played Chief of Staff in Sorkin&#146;s <i>The
    American President. </i>Like Harrison Ford, he earned a promotion. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The First Lady is a
    professional in her own right, an MD. She is media-savvy, sophisticated, and often on the
    road. She also rules him. &quot;Uh oh,&quot; he says about her imminent return. Their
    daughter Zoey is a freshman at Georgetown. There could even be a Monica parallel. We hear
    in passing about a young intern moved from one office to another because of a crush on the
    Vice-President.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief of Staff Leo McGarry
    (John Spencer) will go to the mat for long-time friend Jed. He also has personal problems,
    a broken marriage and past treatment in a Betty Ford-like center. Before his wife leaves
    for the Watergate, he pleads for her to understand. &quot;This job is the most important
    thing I will ever do.&quot; She asks, &quot;More important than your marriage?&quot; she
    asks. His answer is unequivocal: &quot;Yes.&quot;</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not confuse the fictional
    McGarry with the real former Chief of Staff Dick Morris. Was Morris separated? Did Morris
    have to deal with a personal scandal? (There was a certain hotel balcony video.)</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Head Speechwriter Sam Seaborn
    (Rob Lowe) is a Princeton lawyer, brilliant, with high standards. Now who among the
    Clinton crew (George) might that be (Stephanopolis)? </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney) is
    White House Press Secretary. She knows her stuff and is one of the guys, joking with the
    reporters. The fact that she goes by her initials does not link her at all to any former
    women Press Secretaries. (Did we mention that Dee Dee Myers is a consultant for the show?)</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; We may see these parallels,
    but the more we watch, don&#146;t confuse us with the facts. We care about these TV people
    more than we ever cared about Dick Morris. The ensemble acting is terrific. <i>The West
    Wing</i> uses a <i>Mary Tyler Moore Show</i> strategy. People enmeshed at work become a
    type of family. Characters fit into family archetypes.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad, of course, is Sheen.
    We&#146;ve already seen him taking real life wayward son Charlie to task. The Mom of this
    crew is not The First Lady. She&#146;s too young and busy to mother anyone, even daughter
    Zoey. The mother is Jed&#146;s secretary, Mrs. Landingham. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jed whines to her. &quot;Where
    are my reading glasses?&quot; Another encounter runs like this: &quot;I&#146;d like a
    banana now,&quot; he says to her. &quot;I don&#146;t think so,&quot; she replies. &quot;I
    wanted to give you one before, but you were quite snippy, sir.&quot; Jed is a modern Dad,
    vulnerable.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Leo is the slightly shady,
    black sheep uncle who comes through when seas turn rough. He calms Dad down with raucous
    humor before the State of the Union. Sam, Deputy Chief of Staff Josh (Bradley Whitford),
    and Communications Director Toby (Richard Schiff) are the sons willing to defend their
    Dad, no matter the cost. Josh and Sam go to The Hill to wrangle with a Senator sporting a
    Barney Frank-like accent. &quot;This is what happens when we let kids into the White
    House,&quot; the Senator huffs. C.J. is the boys&#146; spinsterish older sister, brainy,
    with a stunted social life.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; These folks share a major
    calling&#151;duty. They eat and sleep in their offices and don&#146;t have time to fetch
    clothes from the cleaners. &quot;Isn&#146;t that the same suit you wore yesterday?&quot;
    one asks. &quot;Yup.&quot;</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because they are so busy
    romancing Congress, no one on the West Wing has time for a relationship. The first episode
    showed Sam in bed with a woman. The writers perhaps didn&#146;t trust us to feel the sex
    appeal of power so soon in the story arc. Sam has to rush off because POTUS had a bicycle
    accident. He later discovers his paramour is a high-priced call girl. He has to drop her.
    Josh and Mandy (Moira Kelly) were a couple, but he finds a picture of them with his face
    scribbled out. No hope there.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; For a possible affair, watch
    C.J. and Danny, a White House reporter (Timothy Busfield). Their courtship is hot, yet
    business-like&#151;direct soulful stares, rushed kisses. Pillow talk between them could
    get conflict of interesting.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The claustrophobic sets differ
    from the Early Corporate of most TV dramas. We&#146;re almost in a different century,
    despite trilling cell phones and clackety copiers. The staffers work out of cubbyholes
    that barely contain their energy. Hand-held cams follow them around corners of narrow
    halls, down elegant staircases. The dim lighting comes from garish sconces. This
    constraining, museum-like backdrop reflects the show&#146;s major tension: human foibles
    held in check by the tradition of the presidency.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; This includes POTUS himself.
    To retaliate for a terrorist attack, Bartlet wants</small><img src="images/sheen.JPG" alt="sheen.JPG (10979 bytes)" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="158" height="178"><small> to bomb a small but aggressive
    country into submission. The Joint Chiefs recommend a &quot;Proportional Response.&quot;
    He angrily questions their advice. Despite some tight moments, he responds as they
    suggest. No imperial Presidency here.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dwellers of the West Wing are
    flawed, mostly well-intended people. In every encounter so far, their personal ambitions
    lie down before the majesty of the office, highly unexpected in these times of a supposed
    cult of personality. Sure, they admire Bartlet, but the Presidency, with a capital <i>P</i>,
    keeps them on point.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Staff presses hard on
    issues ripped from the headlines: sex education, hate crimes, capital punishment, Supreme
    Court nominee confirmation, gun control. Always, they face the line between compromise and
    sell-out.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There are two things in
    the world you never want people to see how you made them: laws and sausages.&quot; Leo
    McGarry, Chief of Staff.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Call this backstage high
    school Civics. The episode <i>Five Votes Down</i> shows us the sometimes unsavory
    trade-offs needed to pass a Bill, in this case gun control. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bartlet stays above this
    arm-twisting for votes. He is cuddly in a sweatshirt and mentally fuzzy from pain pills.
    He hugs people like a sappy drunk. The staff humors him. &quot;President Bartlet
    doesn&#146;t hold a grudge. That&#146;s what he pays me for,&quot; Leo says.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh also tries to win back
    votes before the official tally. He meets with a former fraternity buddy, now a
    Congressman. The camera swirls around the two pugilists. Josh knows the Bill cold, whereas
    his counterpart only wants to win re-election. In many shows, members of Congress come
    across either as charming snakes or thugs in expensive suits. When Josh says, &quot;I am
    so sick of Congress, I could vomit,&quot; we may share the sentiment. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The West Wingers have
    perfected deal-making and the art of the cover-up. They might, for instance, &quot;take
    out the trash.&quot; This strategy unveils an explosive story on Friday night, because
    Saturday has slow news coverage. C.J. wants to tip White House reporter Danny to a real
    story in the trash. He says, &quot;Don&#146;t tell me; I&#146;ll find it.&quot; She
    responds, &quot;I&#146;m not sure you will, because we&#146;ve gotten so good at
    this.&quot;</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Staff usually wins,
    ultimately, but victory feels like flat champagne. Their unethical ways and means take a
    personal toll.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our political landscape has
    shifting sands, and much can happen between now and November. Still, <i>The West Wing</i>
    speaks to voters in a strong voice. That voice says, Despite everything, vote for another
    Democrat.</small></font></p>
