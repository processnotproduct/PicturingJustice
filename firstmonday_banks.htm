                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Taunya Lovell Banks</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Does the success of the television
                  series <i>West Wing</i>, or the Supreme Court's decision in Bush
                  v. Gore, explain CBS's new series <i>First Monday</i>? Perhaps,
                  the Court's highly publicized, but arguably inappropriate and
                  (some argue) unconstitutional inter-meddling with the 2000 presidential
                  election explains why media moguls at CBS believe that a television
                  series about the U.S. Supreme Court is a marketable mid-season
                  replacement.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At this point a disclaimer
                  is warranted. I have never been a clerk for the United States
                  Supreme Court, so I do not have any insider information about
                  the workings of the Court. I know several former clerks, but
                  after reading preliminary reviews of the show, all consciously
                  avoided viewing <i>First Monday</i>. They even declined my offer
                  to loan them my tape of the show.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A dramatic program about the
                  Supreme Court is an interesting concept, a good vehicle for airing
                  controversial issues facing the Court. But CBS's offering lacks
                  the gravitas of a program like <i>West Wing</i>, which airs similar
                  issues while consistently presenting the Office of the President
                  with respectful decorum, even when President Bartlet (Martin
                  Sheen) comes across as a bit silly. Discounting several well-publicized
                  inaccuracies about Court practice and procedure (appellate judges
                  do not question litigants or witnesses; litigants do not sit
                  at the counsel table during oral arguments; the justices do not
                  gather in a circle before oral argument like some football or
                  basketball team) as dramatic license, <i>First Monday</i> fails
                  miserably to capture the solemnity of the United States Supreme
                  Court.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">First Monday</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> starts off a bit like the 1981 film,
                  <i>First Monday</i> in October, only the new justice is Joseph
                  Novelli (Joe Mantegna), not a woman, Justice Ruth Hagadorn Loomis
                  (Jill Clayburgh). All similarities end, however, when Justice
                  Novelli (characterized as a moderate liberal, but perhaps more
                  of a libertarian version of Justice Scalia) comes to his chamber
                  in bedroom slippers. It is a bit crude in parts. Even non-lawyers
                  must have cringed when Justice Esther Weisenberg (the Justice
                  Ginsburg character?) confides to Novelli that she &quot;wet her
                  panties&quot; when she sat in on her first oral argument!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It may be unfair to try to
                  match First Monday's justices with contemporary Supreme Court
                  justices. The show's creator and executive producer, Donald Bellisario,
                  concedes that he went out of the way to make Justice Jerome Morris
                  (James McEachin), &quot;the African American&quot; justice, not
                  sound philosophically like Clarence Thomas. This was probably
                  both a commercial and political decision. Imagine the reaction
                  of the NAACP to a Clarence Thomas character on prime time television!
                  Nevertheless, there are some reference to activities, like the
                  Chief Justice Brankin's penchant for football, that remind us
                  of former justices.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Only one of the two cases that
                  form the first show's focal point raises a constitutional issue.
                  The writers, obviously, were aware of the Court's split decision
                  in a 1989 case, Stanford v. Kentucky. The Stanford case held
                  that executing juveniles does not constitute cruel and unusual
                  punishment, so the writers frame the death penalty issue as an
                  underlying issue. The actual claim is that the execution of a
                  juvenile death row prisoner after his successful brush with a
                  lightning bolt violates the Eighth Amendment.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There were a few glimmers of
                  good writing, like the nice symmetry between the opening and
                  closing scenes. In the opening scene lightning (natural electricity)
                  strikes, but does not kill the prisoner and causes the telephones
                  to fail. Near the end of the show the prisoner is executed by
                  man-made electricity because lightning causes the telephones
                  to fail, preventing Novelli's clerk from notifying the prison
                  that the Justice has issued a stay of execution. But these little
                  gems are few and far between.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The second case involves a
                  transgendered immigrant seeks asylum claim. Given Congress' plenary
                  power over immigration, the issue in this case is simply a matter
                  of statutory interpretation. INS has granted asylum to immigrants
                  who claim prosecution in their home countries because of their
                  homosexuality. Unfortunately, the second issue is played for
                  laughs when the Court's questioning of the petitioner (something
                  that never happens in real life) discloses that the petitioner
                  is really a transvestite!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At times the first episode
                  of <i>First Monday</i> seems like a semi-serious version of Fox's
                  low-brow but highly successful comedy series <i>Ally McBeal</i>.
                  Even Novelli's conservative law clerk Miguel's social encounter
                  with a transgendered attorney sounds suspiciously like a similar
                  <i>Ally McBeal</i> plot involving one of the firm's partners.
                  Often <i>First Monday</i> seems not to know whether to take itself
                  seriously. Good creative writers would go a long way to improving
                  the show.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Another troubling aspects of
                  the show was a currently fashionable pseudo-reality cameo scene.
                  Blurring the line between fiction and reality, like the Washington
                  party scene in the film <i>Traffic</i>, real-life lawyer, Barry
                  Scheck, and conservative radio talk show host, Dennis Prager,
                  argue about the merits of the death penalty case on Curve Ball,
                  a thinly disguised version of the CNN program <i>Hard Ball</i>.
                  Pseudo-reality scenes, like those in <i>First Monday</i> and
                  <i>Traffic</i>, uncritically combine politicalized information
                  bites with entertainment for commercial ends.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Granted, often pseudo-reality
                  scenes are entertaining, but they may not be appropriate in a
                  drama dealing with a prestigious and highly valued governmental
                  institution like the Court, especially at a time when that institution
                  is still struggling to overcome public perceptions about its
                  political partisanship. A good show about the Supreme Court would
                  be helpful in conveying the complexities of the Court and explaining
                  the importance of the Court as an institution.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Sadly, <i>First Monday</i>
                  is no <i>West Wing</i>. It is more like the short-lived Comedy
                  Channel's comedy about the president, <i>That's My Bush!</i>.
                  Hopefully, the consistently bad reviews given the first show
                  will cause CBS to either rework <i>First Monday</i>, or pull
                  the show. If subsequent shows of <i>First Monday</i> are as bad
                  as the first, I may reprogram my Tivo!<br>
