                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Michael Asimow</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Coen Brothers have done
                  it again! <i>The Man Who Wasn't There</i> delivers a loving parody
                  in stunning black-and-white of noir favorites like <i>Double
                  Indemnity</i> and <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i>. It is
                  superb. Hilarious. A knockout.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Billy Bob Thornton, at his
                  stone-faced best, plays Ed Crane, a small town barber of few
                  words but many cigarettes. The always exquisite Frances McDormand
                  is his wife Doris who, it seems, has been straying with her boss
                  Big Dave (James Gandolfini) over at Nirdlinger's Department Store.
                  Now if only Ed could find a way to raise $10,000 to invest in
                  the radical new idea of dry cleaning. . .</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/billybob.jpg" width="207" height="138" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The
                  story then meanders pleasurably through antic subplots, not to
                  mention blackmail and various murders, suicides and other mayhem,
                  with the wrong people getting accused of all the wrong crimes.
                  Anyone who reveals the plot should be sent to the chair, so I'll
                  refrain from disclosing any more of it.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Instead, let's turn to my personal
                  favorite character in the film: the deliciously sleazeball lawyer
                  Freddie Reidenschneider, said to be the best criminal lawyer
                  in California, who winds up defending both Doris and Ed. Tony
                  Shalhoub is picture-perfect in the role of Freddie. Freddie is
                  such a world-class BS artist. He employs the Heisenberg uncertainty
                  principle to illustrate that we can never know whether a fact
                  is true since we will always change it by observing it. Indeed,
                  Ed reports, Freddie told the jury &quot;to look not at the facts,
                  but at the meaning of the facts. Then he said the facts had no
                  meaning.&quot; Also, Freddie lives by the motto &quot;I litigate.
                  I don't capitulate.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Knowing full well that his
                  clients can't afford his services, Freddie tanks up on immense
                  meals at the local eatery at their expense. He unabashedly instructs
                  his clients what lies to tell. And, of course, he dumps them
                  when the money runs out. He is replaced by the thunderously inept
                  public defender Lloyd Garroway who pleads his murder client &quot;guilty
                  with explanation.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Freddie is in the grand tradition
                  of movie shysters, and we law and pop culture mavens could reel
                  off quite a few. Freddie reminded me particularly of the affable
                  gonif Willie Gingrich (Walter Matthau) in <i>The Fortune Cookie</i>
                  (1966) who enthusiastically cooks up a totally phony personal
                  injury case and terrifies the suave insurance lawyers on the
                  other side. Then there's the surpassingly inept Dennis Denuto
                  in <i><a href="winslow_boy.htm">The Castle</a></i> (1997) who
                  relied on &quot;the vibes&quot; from Australia's famous Mabo
                  case.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But my absolute favorite movie
                  shyster is the immortal Billy Flynn (Adolpe Menjou), the criminal
                  defense lawyer in <i><a href="articles/RoxieHart.htm">Roxie Hart</a></i>
                  (1942). This film was the basis for the fabulous Kander and Ebb
                  musical Chicago. (Billy's the one in Chicago who describes his
                  courtroom technique in the lyrics &quot;Show them a little razzle
                  dazzle, razzle dazzle 'em. . .) Billy defends only women who
                  have killed their husbands or boyfriends and, of course, Chicago
                  juries always acquit these lovely ladies. As in <i>The Man Who
                  Wasn't There</i> or <i>The Fortune Cookie</i>, Flynn sees his
                  job as concocting some wholly fictitious story for his murderous
                  client and then selling this nonsense to the newspapers and to
                  the jury.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Well, the lovable shyster Freddy
                  is only one of the numerous attractions of <i>The Man Who Wasn't
                  There</i>, a picture that fans of noir and of law movies simply
                  can't miss.</font></p>
