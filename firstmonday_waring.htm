                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Rob Waring<br>
<br>
                  As I have previously written in </font><a href="westwing-waring.htm"><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Will <i>The West Wing</i> Cause The
                  Left Swing?</font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana">, liberals
                  may have mastered the use of the television political dramas
                  in influencing voters. In <i>The West Wing</i>, viewers see an
                  idealized left-of-center presidency, the one they didn't get
                  in real life. We'll never know how much this helped Al Gore,
                  but obviously not enough to beat George Bush in the electoral
                  college.<br>
<br>
                  Now comes another experiment in influencing the electorate, <i>First
                  Monday</i>, a show about the Supreme Court we don't have in real
                  life and may not for some time. This fictional Court has a five-four
                  liberal majority and the idea seems to be to demonstrate how
                  much more compassionate and interesting the Court could be if
                  only liberals had the votes. (This is quite a leap from asking
                  what things would be like if there were even one liberal on the
                  Court, which presently there is not.)<br>
<br>
                  On television, some justices who care about the plight of the
                  less fortunate work hard to see that the suckers do in fact get
                  an even break, particularly the newest justice, played by Joe
                  Mantegna. (His character is named Novelli-get it?) The conservative
                  justices seem uncaring and horribly bigoted, but at least they
                  have a sense of humor about their reactionary goals. (The justice
                  played by Charles Durning asks a transgendered party if he wishes
                  to be castrated like a bull.)<br>
                  If one takes the jurisprudence of the real Court seriously, the
                  first thought is probably to wonder whether <i>First Monday</i>
                  viewers will take more interest in the workings of the real Court.
                  They may receive more knowledge about issues in some of the cases
                  that come before the court, but combined with a distorted view
                  of the process that I leave to others to critique, this may be
                  worse than the result of their pre-<i>First Monday</i> ignorance.<br>
<br>
                  With little for the public to see of members of the real Court
                  but their decisions and denials of certiorari, I'm betting that
                  the justices will seem pretty callous in comparison to their
                  TV brethren. The execution of juveniles, a controversy on <i>First
                  Monday</i>'s premiere, is not even an issue for the present Court.
                  It appears split over whether discovery of the actual innocence
                  of defendants in death cases can be untimely and thus irrelevant.<br>
<br>
                  For those who regard the Court as a battle ground for ideologies
                  propped up by selective use of precedent, the show presents a
                  zone of comfort. Finally, the veneer is off, our suspicions confirmed
                  and we can rest secure in the knowledge that the Court is just
                  another forum for political advocacy. Those justices and clerks
                  who want things one way do whatever they can to foil the other
                  side, and their opponents respond in kind. Done up for prime
                  time, it's everything that those disappointed with Bush v. Gore
                  complained about-results-oriented jurisprudence. Seeking the
                  truth is secondary to beating the other guys. The conservative
                  Chief Justice, played by James Garner, sums it up best-his main
                  goal is to trip up the new liberal player before he gets too
                  much influence with the other justices. <br>
<br>
                  I do not have a problem with the present advantage liberals have
                  in television political drama for two reasons. First, I'm a liberal,
                  so any method that gets the word out works for me. Second, money
                  is speech in this electronic information age in which we live,
                  and the conservatives have barrels full. Bush spent twice as
                  much in the election as Gore did, and most of that money came
                  from business interests with a definite agenda. As campaign finance
                  reform is nowhere in sight, Enron or no Enron, using drama to
                  attempt some sort of balance is about the only option we have.<br>
<br>
                  Perhaps people will pay no attention to this show and it will
                  die a quick death. Alternatively, perhaps to a greater extent
                  viewers will see the real Court as more about personalities than
                  process. If so, they may seek more information about the personality
                  and ideology of the next Supreme Court nominee.<br>
<br>
                  If <i>First Monday</i> takes off, Democrats had better hurry
                  up with a show about Congress before Republicans catch on and
                  pilot their own. More likely from Bush would be a combat show
                  about the War on Terrorism as seen a by a globe-hopping special
                  forces unit. Or perhaps a show about the CIA. Wait a minute,
                  that one's already happened! If I die mysteriously next week,
                  you'll know I was right.<br>
<br>
                  But, I'm probably all wrong about this propaganda angle. More
                  likely, if <i>First Monday</i> survives its first season, we'll
                  see less about case appeals and more viewer-appealing devices
                  such as co-ed bathrooms or fantasy song sequences. How long will
                  it take for some of the characters to start sleeping with each
                  other? Stay tuned.<br>
