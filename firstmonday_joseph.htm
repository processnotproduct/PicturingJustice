                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Paul Joseph</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The dramatic potential of a
                  trial is obvious. The two sides do battle. Examination and cross-examination,
                  objections and motions and final argument give plenty of opportunities
                  for direct person-on-person conflict. That there are so many
                  trial-based lawyer shows may not only be because Americans are
                  fascinated by the legal system but also because getting drama
                  out of a court trial is so darned easy.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The creators of <i>First Monday</i>
                  deserve credit for attempting something arguably more difficult.
                  The Supreme Court is, of course, the site of momentous legal
                  decisions which have an impact on us all. The results are dramatic,
                  but the procedure often is not.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In an appellate court, there
                  are no witnesses breaking down on the stand. The parties may
                  not even attend the appellate arguments. Written briefs make
                  up the bulk of the legal presentations. Oral arguments are conducted
                  seriatim, one lawyer after another. There are no objections,
                  lawyers do not interrupt each other. Even with questions from
                  the bench, it's fair to say that the dramatic tools inherent
                  in the appellate setting are more limited than those in portrayals
                  of trials.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The challenge, then, is to
                  make not only the cases but the appellate process dramatic in
                  a way that will hold the interest of a mass television audience.
                  First Monday starts with an evenly balanced court. Four liberal
                  and four conservatives (including the Chief Justice, Thomas Brankin,
                  played by James Garner) are battling for the judicial soul of
                  new Justice Joseph Novelli (Joe Mantegna). Added conflict comes
                  from the battles between Novelli's three clerks, one of whom
                  is conservative generally in conflict with the other two, a liberal
                  and a moderate. Flashbacks to the cases get us out of the Supreme
                  Court and we are treated to the Justice and others watching &quot;point/counterpoint&quot;
                  type news shows with cameo appearances by real life issue celebs
                  such as Jerry Falwell and lawyer Gloria Allred.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Actually, these tools are good
                  ones and give promise that the show could be entertaining, exciting
                  and (oh no) educational too. Several of the cast members are
                  long-time favorites capable of turning in excellent performances.
                  So why were the first two shows so painful to watch? Why did
                  I find myself wincing? Why have the reviews, both in the professional
                  press and within the ranks of PJ reviews, been less than enthusiastic?
                  It's the writing, stupid. So far, it hasn't been very good.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It's possible to handle difficult
                  legal and political issues well and still make dramatic television.
                  The <i>West Wing</i> does it week after week. The show has become
                  expert in finding ways to explain complex and difficult issues
                  quickly but with depth, adroitly blending humor and drama while
                  developing rich characters.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So far, <i>First Monday</i>
                  hasn't found its way. The dialogue sounds stagy and cliched and
                  the characters are cartoonish caricatures of their political
                  labels. For some reason, the clerks seem to be playing their
                  parts young-almost like the high school students on Boston Public
                  rather than young lawyers in career-making positions.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I'm always leery about criticizing
                  popular television for taking liberties with the details of law
                  and legal practice. The goal isn't to create a documentary but
                  entertainment television. But an error in the first show bothered
                  me because it seemed unnecessary and because it suggested a failure
                  of the writer's imagination.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In a truly horrendous moment,
                  a Justice directs a question not to the lawyer but to the party,
                  a pre-op transgendered asylum seeker-and then proceeds to ridicule
                  the poor sod. Hearing the confusion of the client wasn't a bad
                  dramatic idea, but couldn't the writer have found a better way
                  to do it than the gross misrepresentation of appellate court
                  procedure for no better reason than to show us that the Justice
                  is a jerk.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It's too soon to write off
                  <i>First Monday</i>. The show may feel that it must establish
                  the broad outlines of character and setting before showing us
                  nuance and depth. But the public won't wait long. The writing
                  must improve or the epitaph of <i>First Monday</i> will not be
                  that the show is bad law, but that it is not very good television.<br>
