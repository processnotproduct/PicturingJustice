                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Judith Grant</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Since HBO's success with what
                  the &quot;Industry&quot; likes to call &quot;edgy&quot; original
                  TV shows like <i>The Sopranos</i> and <i>Sex and the City</i>,
                  network and cable television has had major sex and violence envy.
                  How could it compete with television shows that have no limits
                  on nudity and profanity? The FX network appears to have met that
                  challenge with its new police drama, <i>The Shield</i>. It is
                  already a success with viewers and critics. TV Guide called the
                  drama &quot;dramatically tantalizing and morally perilous,&quot;
                  and The Hollywood Reporter favorably compared it to <i>NYPD Blue</i>.
                  <i>The Shield</i>, whose promo proclaims, &quot;The road to justice
                  is twisted,&quot; presents an interesting case study in Hollywood's
                  ongoing fascination with antiheroes and their relationship to
                  the law.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The figure of the cop-as-antihero
                  has never had to stretch its parameters as much as it does in
                  this series. Comparisons that have been made between <i>The Shield</i>
                  and the Mafia drama <i>The Sopranos</i> are misplaced. Bernard
                  Weintraub wrote in the New York Times, Detective Vic Mackey,
                  &quot;seems to evoke the same ambiguity as Tony Soprano.&quot;
                  But is Vic really like Tony Soprano? I suspect that those who
                  have seen a common moral ambiguity see it in the fact that these
                  are both occasionally likeable characters that do bad things.
                  Both shows are also very well crafted using innovative topics
                  and flashy film techniques. However, in the case of Tony, we
                  have a hard-core criminal with a conscience. In the case of <i>The
                  Shield</i>'s Detective Vic Mackey, we have a police officer who
                  openly engages in criminal behavior. The two scenarios are not
                  the same. Vic is supposed to be protecting people from people
                  like Tony, not emulating them. Hollywood and many Americans have
                  been conned into accepting the kind of police hero whose propensity
                  for rule-breaking is the cost of keeping us safe from serious
                  criminals. This is a dubious trade-off. However, even if one
                  accepts this, it is very not clear that one ought to make the
                  same moral adjustment for a cop who breaks the law merely to
                  line his own pockets. In the second case, the police become identical
                  to the criminals they stalk.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Police antiheroes are usually
                  differentiated from criminal antiheroes by the fact that cops
                  break laws to serve some higher purpose. For example, Dirty Harry
                  is fun to watch to the extent that one can forgive his law-breaking--
                  insofar as it is portrayed as being a necessary evil used only
                  to lock up bad guys. In contrast, Tony Soprano of <i>The Sopranos</i>
                  is fun because he's a Mafia boss with a heart of gold. Yes, he
                  commits crimes to line his pockets, but that's his job. He is,
                  after all, in the Mob. Tony and Harry are true antiheroes. In
                  contrast, <i>The Shield</i> presents us with a lead character;
                  Detective Vic Mackey, who is a kind of Dirty Harry meets Tony
                  Soprano. That FX wants to treat him sympathetically and to link
                  him to vigilante pop culture cops rather than to criminals, is
                  evidenced by the way FX describes Vic on the show's elaborate
                  website. He is, they say, &quot;an effective cop who operates
                  under his own rules.&quot; FX's writers leave out the part about
                  him being a common criminal. Make that a common criminal with
                  a heart of gold. It was established within the first few episodes
                  that Vic can't stand to watch kiddie porn, and just hates it
                  when kids get killed in gang cross-fires. He also has an autistic
                  son. What a guy.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So far, we have seen Vic having
                  an affair with a co-worker, lying, stealing cocaine and re-selling
                  it, covering up a murder, beating up a suspect during interrogation,
                  and being responsible for a gang hit. In the latter case, there
                  is a clear link made between Vic and the gang activities he is
                  supposed to be curtailing. Intervening in a conflict between
                  two rappers, Kearn and T-Bone, who are connected to two rival
                  gang factions, Vic tries to arrange a truce. Failing in an attempt
                  to stop drug traffic until a flap about a homicide dies down,
                  Vic arranges a meeting between the two rappers at the station.
                  &quot;Give me the money, bitch,&quot; says one rapper to the
                  other. Vic comes up with a solution. &quot;Kearn,&quot; he says,
                  &quot;you take tonight and come up with a number.&quot; Turning
                  to T-Bone, &quot;You revise yours down a bit, then you bring
                  me the numbers and I decide what's fair.&quot; &quot;Yeah, who
                  are you supposed to be? Judge Judy?&quot; inquires a smirking
                  T-Bone.But this fails too, and Vic decides the best course of
                  action is to lock the two rivals in a truck overnight. The plan
                  goes awry, as when he arrives the next morning. Kearn has killed
                  T-Bone. &quot;Oh, shit,&quot; exclaims Vic. Indeed, he now cannot
                  arrest Kearn for the murder as he has basically arranged and
                  made possible. Moreover, at least in real life this would only
                  escalate the gang conflict. Vic's reaction is telling. After
                  his initial shock, he turns reflective, and looking admiringly
                  at Kearn he follows him slowly to the edge of the dock. The camera
                  shows the back of the two men in silhouette against the sunrise.
                  Vic looks at Kearn. &quot;You hungry?&quot; he asks. The end.
                  Vic and Kearn are linked, not in moral ambiguity, but in a macho
                  and violent street ethic.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">New York Times writer Weintraub
                  quotes Peter Liguori, chairman of FX, who affirmed the importance
                  of the recent film <i>Training Day</i> in pointing to a previously
                  unknown audience for a &quot;fully dimensionalized representation
                  of the police.&quot; Just as the parallels to <i>The Sopranos</i>
                  are problematic, so are the ones made to the film, <i>Training
                  Day</i>. True, like Vic Mackey, the lead character in <i>Training
                  Day</i> (played masterfully by Denzel Washington) is both a vigilante
                  and an outright criminal. However, he is not held up as the hero
                  (or even a true antihero) the way that Vic Mackey is on <i>The
                  Shield</i>. The hero in <i>Training Day</i> is an honest rookie
                  cop (played by Ethan Hawke) who upends Denzel's criminal career.
                  In fact, Denzel's character is so unsympathetic that even we
                  root for the gangbangers to help rid the neighborhood of his
                  bad influence in the film's penultimate scene. In contrast, the
                  honest rookie cop in <i>The Shield</i> is not the hero. He is
                  portrayed as an uptight bible-thumper who is also, by the way,
                  a closeted gay, black man. He has a conscience, but his own struggle
                  with being a gay, which he believes to be a sin, places him dramatically
                  as merely a different kind of hypocrite with a psychological
                  axe to grind.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It is undoubtedly the case
                  that a slew of police corruption scandals also helped to create
                  an audience for <i>The Shield</i>. People seem to have significantly
                  lowered their standards for law enforcement officers, and have
                  accepted these kinds of portrayals as entertainment. The connection
                  to the Los Angeles &quot;Rampart&quot; scandal, for example,
                  is indicated by the series of name changes undergone by <i>The
                  Shield</i>. It was originally called <i>The Barn</i> (an ironic
                  use of the name of the place where pigs live). The show's title
                  was then, quite remarkably, changed to <i>Rampart</i>. This was
                  an allusion to the 1998 Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)
                  corruption scandal of the same name. At that time an LAPD spokesperson
                  lamented to The LA Times that the show capitalizes on sensationalistic
                  headlines and &quot;negatively influences youth.&quot; FOX, the
                  parent company of FX, countered that the show was not intended
                  to be about the actual police department, citing the dubious
                  distinction that they were &quot;not setting the program at the
                  actual Rampart Station.&quot; Attempting to take a na&iuml;ve
                  high road, Lt. Horace Frank, LAPD's director of media relations,
                  said, &quot;I think it's very unfortunate that FOX would seek
                  to capitalize on such a disturbing and depressing part of our
                  history for money.&quot; It is, of course, quite a bit far from
                  unimaginable that a television corporation would try to capitalize
                  on something for money! Still, the LAPD complaints appear to
                  have prevailed, and FX ultimately chose a third name for the
                  show, settling on <i>The Shield</i>. They then set the show in
                  the fictitious town of Farmington. Farmington, of course, looks
                  a lot like the seedier sections of Los Angeles.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Despite FX's protestations
                  that <i>The Shield</i> had nothing to do with Rampart, the LAPD
                  Rampart District scandal, in fact, had a lot of cops who looked
                  a lot like Vic and his friends. Both have cops who stole cocaine
                  from the evidence room for later re-sale, were part of a high-
                  prestige, anti-gang task force with a great deal of autonomy,
                  hired themselves out as security to rap record labels, and ran
                  their own versions of street justice. These included physical
                  intimidation, covering up of criminal activity, murder, robbery,
                  and in the case of Rampart, framing innocent people. <i>The Shield</i>'s
                  website announces that the show takes place in a &quot;tough
                  morally ambiguous world.&quot; But seen in the context of its
                  distinct similarities to Rampart, <i>The Shield</i> is less &quot;morally
                  ambiguous&quot; than it is just morally irresponsible.<br>
