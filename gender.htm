    INTERPLAY OF RACE AND GENDER</strong></font></p>
    <font face="Verdana"><p align="center"><font color="#000000"><small>by Rob Waring</small></font></font><p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Women have made such
    substantial socioeconomic and political progress in the last thirty years that there isn't
    much talk these days about gender equality in the affirmative action debate. The victories
    of modern women against a male-dominated corporate structure have been portrayed on the
    screen in such films as <i>Norma Rae</i> and <i>Silkwood</i>. Less often seen on
    television and in films are examples of where the struggles for gender and racial equality
    have collided, resulting in either bitter conflict or hopeful cooperation. A recent tv
    documentary, <i>Not For Ourselves Alone, </i>and a long-forgotten film, <i>Salt of the
    Earth, </i>show how cooperation is the more fruitful option.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; What now seems forgotten,
    because women are significantly&#150;though not</small><img src="images/anthony.JPG" alt="anthony.JPG (25008 bytes)" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="192" height="246"><small>
    completely&#150;integrated into the power structure, is that the struggle for gender
    equality began in the United States more than one hundred and fifty years ago and took
    half of that time to accomplish its first major goal: women&#146;s suffrage. Ken Burns'
    recent PBS documentary, <i>Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton
    and Susan B. Anthony</i>, portrays their struggle for suffrage during the nineteenth
    century. It is a first-hand account of their efforts to change discriminatory laws, told
    via letters read as voice-overs accompanying a series of photographs of these great women
    and their times, interspersed with narration. A primary motivation of the film makers was
    the fact that most Americans have never heard of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the intellectual
    soul of the suffragist movement. This roughly four-hour program likely will be rebroadcast
    or released on video and is well-worth viewing.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll mention just two of the
    many fascinating things about this program: First, what drove Anthony and others to labor
    their entire adult lives, nearly sixty years, for a cause they correctly anticipated would
    not be achieved during their lifetimes? I won't attempt to explain their idealism here,
    you'll have to watch the documentary and draw your own conclusions. These women inspired
    those who worked with them to continue the fight for the vote until the Constitution was
    amended 1920. Surely their efforts deserve more national recognition than one side of a
    dollar coin that most people never use. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, a great moral conflict
    arose during the campaign. Early on, in the two decades preceding the Civil War,
    suffragists worked hand in hand with abolitionists to end slavery. When that struggle was
    vindicated at the end of the war, Congress debated the passage of the Fourteenth and
    Fifteenth Amendments&#150;intended to grant all the privileges of citizenship to blacks.
    Much to the frustration of the suffragists, these amendments did not extend privileges to
    women&#150;of any color. Splitting from the cause of the abolitionists, the suffragist
    movement opposed these amendments, preferring to hold out for including women in the
    change. In the end, women did not get the vote until more than sixty years later, and the
    documentary opines that this attempt to hold hostage rights for blacks cost the
    suffragists much needed political support.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example of racial and
    gender politics colliding is the 1954 black and white film, <i>Salt of the Earth</i>, just
    out on DVD. The film tells the true story of a zinc miners strike in New Mexico in the
    early 1950's. It lacks the polished character development and plot tension of more recent
    labor films such as John Sayles' <i>Matewan</i>&#150;dramatizing strikes and the unions'
    efforts to resolve racial conflicts leading up to the West Virginia coal mine wars of the
    1920's. However, the inspiring story of <i>Salt of the Earth</i> makes the film well worth
    renting.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The film begins (as does <i>Matewan</i>)
    by depicting the danger of miners' work. The miners' belief that the mining company is
    poorly protecting their safety leads to a flashpoint of anger about low wages. Racial
    discrimination is evident because miners at this mine, who are mostly Mexican-American,
    are paid less than those at neighboring mines where the miners are Anglos. A strike
    ensues, with all the violent and illegal attempts at strikebreaking that one could imagine
    would be perpetrated by an evil employer. The strikers do not have the discipline to avoid
    responding with violence of their own (one of several themes repeated in <i>Matewan</i>),
    but their wives intervene in a way that saves the day.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the film focuses on
    the home life of the miners' families. The wives are angry that their pitiful homes in the
    company town do not even have </small><img src="images/salt.JPG" alt="salt.JPG (20578 bytes)" width="166" height="203" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"><small>running
    water, while in the company towns of mines worked by Anglos, amenities and better
    sanitation make life significantly safer and easier. When the strike begins, the wives
    implore their husbands to make improved home sanitation a demand, but the men refuse. The
    men view pursuit of the women's needs as jeopardizing their goals of eliminating racial
    discrimination in mine safety and wages. It is not until the men stay home while their
    wives carry on the strike that the men are forced to confront the daily hardships endured
    by their wives, such as having to carry potable water and chop the wood needed for hot
    water and heat. When men and women unite in their struggle for racial equality, their
    combined efforts win both groups' goals. Perhaps Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.
    Anthony could have learned a lesson from this film.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some viewers will find the
    story of how <i>Salt of the Earth</i> was made to be even more noble than the labor
    struggle it chronicles. The story is told in considerable detail on the special features
    section of the DVD. The film was written, directed, scored and produced by film artists
    blacklisted during the McCarthy era. Government and the film industry continuously
    attempted to thwart the film, and those involved in its production were sometimes
    subjected to threats of violence and death. <i>Salt of the Earth</i> is a testament to the
    fragility of our First Amendment rights, which were of little help to alleged communists
    in 1954.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; All the extras and many of the
    principle actors were cast from the miners and their families who endured the actual
    events of the story. The only actor most viewers will recognize is Will Geer, who played
    the evil sheriff. He was not able to find work in films for a decade following <i>Salt of
    the Earth</i>, but later went on to portray Grandpa Walton on the long-running television
    series. The female lead, Rosaura Revueltas, a Mexican actress, was deported during
    shooting, and some of her scenes had to be secretly filmed in Mexico later. She was
    blacklisted in her homeland and never appeared in another film.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Editing took more than a year,
    because most labs would not process the film. Work was done in secret safe houses to hide
    from those who sought to destroy the prints they imagined were Communist propaganda. Only
    thirteen theaters in the United States showed the film in 1954, but it had greater
    distribution in Europe where it won awards. Most people who have seen the film in the
    United States saw it on college campuses in the 1960's, projected from 16mm stock.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; A simplistic, but
    important lesson from <i>Not for Ourselves Alone</i> and <i>Salt of the Earth</i> is that
    different groups working for social justice may achieve their goals more rapidly by
    working together instead of competing. This documentary and film also show how the road to
    achieving idealistic goals is paved with moral conflict and hardship aplenty.</small></font><p>
