                  that Bad?</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Taunya Lovell Banks</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Perhaps the only thing really
                  new in CBS's latest entry in the lawyer drama genre is its setting
                  twenty-five years in the future.  Some things have changed in
                  Los Angeles 25 years in the future, blurring legal boundaries
                  (who is human and who is not; what constitutes rape) - real futuristic
                  ethical issues.  Yet other things remain the same.  Law firms
                  function in essentially the same way and lawyer clothing seems
                  virtually unchanged. To remind us that we are in the future there
                  is the occasional high-resolution holographic projection, paper
                  thin computer screen and seedless fruit. Nevertheless, courtroom
                  tricks are what keep lawyer series popular, and which may ultimately
                  determine whether this series survives the season.  </font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Century City</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> is populated with many old lawyer
                  stereotypes, some in new clothing.  The law firm of Crane, Constable,
                  McNeil, &amp; Montero has a former prosecutor, Lukas Gold (played
                  by Ioan Gruffudd), who CBS describes as an &quot;earnest, self
                  critical&quot; associate trapped in an early marriage.  Next
                  there is the slimy sexual harassing but brilliant litigating
                  partner Darwin Mc Neill (played by Eric Schaeffer but not as
                  deliciously as James Spader in <i>The Practice</i>).  In a slight
                  twist, the intellectual blonde female first year associate, Lee
                  May Bristol (played by Kristen Lehman), is beautiful, genetically
                  enhanced and sterile, an interesting combination that also says
                  a lot about technological imperfections.  Evidentially Lee May
                  had a summer fling with Lukas leaving a lot of unresolved sexual
                  tension and a door open for in-house romance.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In an interesting bit of casting
                  Latino Hector Elizondo plays an Anglo lawyer, Marty Constable,
                  the grey-haired balding experienced partner brought back into
                  the fold after bouts with alcohol and too many young blonde wives.
                   Crane, Constable, McNeil, &amp; Montero also has two non-white
                  law partners.  Nestor Carbonell, whose father is Cuban, plays
                  the Mexican American partner Tom Montero.  Montero is no traditional
                  Mexican American stereotype.  He is an assimilated upper middle
                  class Ivy League educated Mexican American and a former congressman,
                  who is the firm's chief rainmaker.  There are people like Montero
                  in the real world, so it should be no surprise that they finally
                  appear on the television in the world of 2030.  More significantly,
                  Montero's Stanford Law School classmate, Hannah Crane (played
                  by Viola Davis), a black woman, is the founding partner.  Unlike
                  many non-whites portrayed on television today, Montero and Crane,
                  the daughter of an old civil rights lawyer, are well educated
                  children of professional parents - much like what we would expect
                  of Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable's adult grandchildren in 2030.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Unfortunately, Crane does not
                  see much real lawyer action in the first episode.  One hopes
                  that she is more than a mother figure.  All Crane seems to do
                  is look weary  like Eugene Young (Steve Harris) on <i>The Practice</i>
                  now that he is the senior partner. Also notable in the first
                  episode is the special guest appearance by <i>Law &amp; Order</i>:
                  Special Victims Unit's B.D. Wong.  Wong plays U.S. Attorney Matthew
                  Chin. Other than Lucy Liu on the now defunct <i>Ally McBeal</i>,
                  Asian lawyers are rarities on television lawyer shows.  Wong
                  represents the government in a case involving a confiscated &quot;pre&quot;
                  embryo.  The law firm represents the father (David Paymer), a
                  widower whose dying 7-year-old son was born with a defective
                  liver.  The father clones his son's cells to develop a baby who
                  could donate a portion of its liver to save the son.  We learn
                  that cloning now is illegal in the United States.  So the father
                  smuggles the cloned cells into the United States from Singapore,
                  where cloning is legal, but his future embryo is confiscated
                  at customs.  Now he is suing for its return.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">We later learn that the son
                  is a clone of the father - making the child and father brothers,
                  and the child's grandparents, his biological parents.  This plot
                  line sounds like something leftover from <i>Ally McBeal</i>.
                  The father's liver is not compatible because he contracted hepatitis
                  as a teen.  If this plot is suppose to be futuristic then the
                  creators of <i>Century City</i> need to get a new science advisor.
                   Given the work being done today on organ regeneration and growth,
                  it is highly unlikely that someone in 2030 would need to clone
                  a person to get a liver for transplantation.  But then the story
                  would be less compelling if the writers stuck closer to reality.
                   There were other misconceptions about the science of cloning
                  and stem cells, but they can be overlooked as artistic license,
                  after all, this is entertainment television. <br>

<br>
                  The other case in the first episode is also <i>Ally McBeal</i>
                  like.  It involves an old rocker (Anthony Zerbe) who refused
                  to undergo plastic surgery and take experimental drugs to stay
                  young.  He is suing other members of the rock band, all in the
                  60s and 70s, for refusing to let him join them on their road
                  show.  The Firm represents the band members.  When a youthful
                  looking 70ish band member dies of a stroke, the band ultimately
                  reunites at the funeral where the old rocker dances around like
                  a twenty-year-old, obviously the work of a body double.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At best <i>Century City</i>
                  is a less slick version of <i>L.A. Law</i> set twenty-five years
                  in the future.  At its worse, the show is a serious version of
                  A<i>lly McBeal</i> with some of its silliness.  If <i>Century
                  City</i> continues to rely more on futuristic technological gimmicks
                  rather than hard hitting story lines, I suggest you tune in to
                  <i>The D.A.</i> instead.  Although this show lacks <i>Century
                  City</i>'s racial and gender diversity, the story lines seems
                  to carry more punch.  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There may be hope, however.
                   The second episode of <i>Century City </i>involved what the
                  lawyers called a virtual rape.  The male partner of the woman
                  was given something that allowed a third-party to feel all the
                  sensations of the male partner during sexual intercourse with
                  the woman.  The third-party could replay this sensation over
                  and over.  The legal question raised was more challenging, was
                  the action a privacy issue, rape or neither, especially if the
                  male partner consented?  This plotline seemed a more realistic
                  example of the kinds of legal problems future technological advances
                  might present.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In a later unaired episode
                  parents choose to have the &quot;gay gene&quot; removed from
                  their child, thus eliminating homosexuals.  This action raises
                  many interesting questions. If parents chose to make their children
                  heterosexuals to make life easier, would parents do the same
                  for race?  The same consequences would occur if the genes that
                  control race are modified.  Thus one wonders whether racial differences
                  would persist in the near future.  After all, the parents in
                  film Gattaca chose &quot;white&quot; as the racial designation
                  for their genetically enhanced embryo.  It will be interesting
                  to see how <i>Century City</i> handles this issue.<br>
