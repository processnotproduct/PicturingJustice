            I very much enjoyed Suggs' comparison of <i>Adam's Rib </i>with
            <i>A Time to Kill</i> but would like to set out another way to
            look at Hepburn's performance in <i>Adam's Rib</i>. I think we
            can see Hepburn as portraying the lawyer as &quot;trickster.&quot;
            &quot;Trickster&quot; figures in mythology as folks like Hermes
            and Mercuy or the Coyote or Raven in Native American folklore.
            Lewis Hyde tells us in &quot;The Trickster Makes this World&quot;
            that tricksters are people who intervene when conventional society
            comes to gridlock; their intervention is to break up the ossified
            status quo to allow a &quot;new world&quot; to emerge, and their
            tactics tend to be amoral&#151;or at least not bounded by conventional
            morality.<br>
            Isn't that just what Hepburn does. She finds a very solemn legal
            system quite self-satisfied with itself by unable to accept the
            humanity of women and uses all sorts of &quot;unprofessional&quot;
            tactics to humiliate the law (and her spouse) towards the end
            of opening the system up to justice.<br>
            This might be a much better way for us to view lawyers (like
            Johnny Cochran)--people who use unusual tactics to awaken us
            to realities we would rather ignore.</font></p>

            I agree that the lawyer films are not necessarily anti-lawyer.
            Making a character a lawyer aids the story because it sends certain
            signals to the audience, i.e. this character is intelligent,
            this character has a lot of money (rarely is the lawyer who struggles
            beneath his/her shingle portrayed), and this character holds
            someone's life in his/her hands. Lawyers make for good drama
            because, even though the bulk of the job (research, interviews,
            drafting motions) is usually not portrayed, the law will always
            be there to provide that climatic battle. Because a film is a
            story, it must have a perspective. This in turn divides the law
            into two sides&#151;good and evil (although I realize that I
            am way over simplifying things, you can see my point). Films
            take on that anti-lawyer feel because we leave the theater hating
            one of the lawyers. As time goes by, we tend to hold on to those
            feelings of hatred much longer than we do any feelings connected
            with the triumph of good. But it is not the fault of the genre
            that the evil lawyer stands out. All through literature (see
            Paradise Lost), authors have fought with this problem: Evil is
            just more interesting than Good.</font></p>

            of Law<br>
            I saw the <i>Last Wave</i> when it first came out. After reading
            John Denvir's comments I was drawn to comment and also I will
            see the film again. The conflict between Aboriginal law and Western
            (Australian law) is frequently in the news. Recently an Aboriginal
            elder assaulted a photographer who was taking photos against
            his wishes on Aboriginal land. The photographer complained and
            criminal assault charges were brought. The case was dismissed
            by the Magistrate in the Northern Territory on the basis of Aboriginal
            law. This has caused a political storm in the Territory with
            the Chief Minister (head of that Government) stating the decision
            is wrong and that it shows discrimination in favour of Aboriginals.<br>
            In Darwin a constitutional convention is atempting to establish
            the Territory as a State. One of the issues that is causing problems
            is that the whites are seeking to have a provision included that
            will make sure Aboriginals are no different than anyone else.
            There appears to be, at least among conservative politicians,
            little unstanding of the complexity and relevance of Aboriginal
            law.<br>
            A recent Australian novel, Al Turello's <i>Wild Justice</i> (Arrow
            Press, 1995) involves some interesting legal probems concerning
            the death by clubbing of an Aboriginal lawyer. It appears to
            be a tribal killing, but there is much more involved. Aboriginal
            custom has an important role in achieving a just solution to
            various murders.<br>
            There is also a distinct possibility that the Australian government
            is preparing to run an early election on the 'race issue'&#151;the
            right of Aboriginals to have access to land held under long term
            leases by graziers, farmers and mining companies. If the present
            conservative government prevails the role of Aboriginal customary
            law will be greatly diminished.<br>
            Postscript by Stan Ross on The Last Wave: added September 9,
            1998<br>
            There have been further developments in the confrontation between
            Aboriginal law and 'white man law'. On September 1, 1998 a senior
            Aboriginal traditional owner of the Jabiluka uranium mine site
            was found guilty of criminal trespass on her own land. Yvonne
            Margarula had argued that she was exercising her rights as part
            of Aboriginal tradition when she was demonstrating against mining
            uranium on her land. The magistrate held that he was 'satisfied
            beyond reasonable doubt that the use and occupation the accused
            put the land was not in accordance with Aboriginal tradition....
            Even if one could form the view that the very use and occupation
            was in accordance with Aboriginal tradition, the magistrate was
            satisfied those actions would still interfere with the use of
            enjoyment of Energy Resources Australia's (the mining company)
            interest in the land. Yvonne Margarula is now seeking legal advice
            as to a possibly appealing the decision.</font></p>

            I find it difficult to see why John Denvir takes Polanski's <i>Chinatown</i>
            to be an indictment of capitalism. Throughout the film, it is
            not the free market which subverts the public good; rather, it
            is the manipulation of political institutions by persons like
            Cross which leads to the exploitation of the many to serve the
            interests of the few.<br>
            But this is something that advocates of laissez-faire have realized
            for years. It has been expressed by persons like William Legget
            who, in the Jacksonian era, couched plea for economic liberty
            in very populist terms, and it is still being expressed by modern
            libertarians, such as Murray Rothbard and others in the Austrian
            school of economics. Indeed, much of the insights of public choice
            theory are little more than elaborations on the way in which
            the government power is manipulated by private interests.<br>
            Where those in the classical liberal tradition differ from those
            such as Professor Denvir is not in their diagnosis of the problem,
            then, but in their perscribed solution. While those in the welfare-statist
            wing of the liberal tradition argue that such corruption is best
            dealt with by political oversight, classical liberals have long
            argued that the only way to limit the abuse of government is
            to limit the scope of government. By barring the use of political
            coercion as a legitimate means of economic advancement, we pave
            the way for a truly &quot;populist&quot; system in which each
            person is free to seek her own good in the free and voluntary
            exchange of the market.</font></p>

            I'm just plain bothered by a film that:<br>
            1) portrays people as using the legal system as a salve for their
            own spiritual yearnings (the film is about more than particular
            loss, it is about the loss of meaning and significance that has
            occurred in all areas of modern life), <br>
            2) suggests that it is our lack of community that ails us, <br>
            3) hints at the role that the modern consumer economy plays in
            undermining our humanity (Lawyers comment to father about how
            all our kids are dead wandering comatose through shopping malls)
            and <br>
            4) then actually makes a great case for the pro-corporate mantra
            that what we need is tort reform?<br>
            Political Message: If only people couldn't sue (corporations)
            to ease their pain, they would be forced to turn back to one
            another and re-build their communities. (Conservative version
            of deTocqueville)<br>
            Why not? If only corporations and the growth of the modern industrial
            economy hadn't elevated selfishness and the private family above
            community, we would be able to both avoid the emptiness of modern
            life AND the callousness of corporate cost-benefit analyses that
            make litigation justifiable. (Liberal version of deTocqueville)</font>.

            I really liked the movie <i>Election</i> and Denvir's review,
            but I was especially fascinated by his view of &quot;Mr. M&quot;
            as the only character with the capacity for change, growth, and
            self-awareness. Is it possible, I wondered, whether, presumably
            a &quot;popular&quot; professor, identified just a bit with Mr.
            M? <br>
            While Denvir says that the other characters are not mere cartoons,
            he implies that he agrees with Tracy's view [wasn't Reese Witherspoon
            terrific?] that Mr. M should never have bothered to play around
            with Destiny. The rest of them are doomed to repeat their neurotic
            patterns, but somehow Mr. M is exempt? I certainly agree that
            just about anything would be better than repeating the neurotic
            pattern of &quot;making love&quot; to Mrs. M as she demandingly
            cries out &quot;fill me up! fill me up!&quot;, but I'm not as
            sanguine as Denvir that he might have really learned something
            from his experiences. To me, Tammy is the one who managed to
            manipulate the situation for her own benefit. She got to go where
            the girls are. Why are is Denvir so sure that she won't find
            her true soulmate? <br>
            And I don't necessarily agree that &quot;dumb as a stick&quot;
            Paul was too nice to be successful in politics. Certainly, the
            Nixon type can't afford to be nice, but how about Reagan? He
            was Mr. Affable, letting his henchman do the nasty stuff. If
            you're dumb enough, you can be oblivious to what your underlings
            are doing in your name. <br>
            These disagreements aside, it's clear that Denvir is one of the
            most insightful critics of his generation. <br>

            As an interesting comparison to <i>Liar Liar</i>, how about <i>All
            Of Me</i> (1984) with Steve Martin?</font> <font size="-1" face="Verdana">Besides
            <i>Liar Liar</i>, <i>AOM</i> is the only magical-intervention-causes-usually-lying-lawyer-to-tell-the-truth
            movie I know of.<br>
            Premise: Rich Lily Tomlin wants to have her soul placed into
            young woman's body when she (Tomlin) dies but the soul is put
            into Steve Martin's body by mistake. Martin is introduced as
            a PI specialist who will bend the truth to get a favorable settlement
            for clients. One of the high points in <i>AOM</i> is a courtroom
            scene: wife seeking large amount in divorce settlement from husband,
            whose extramarital affairs figure importantly into the alimony
            settlement. Steve Martin's character, exhausted from all the
            preparation he's been doing on the case, falls asleep and the
            &quot;other half&quot; of his body (Lily Tomlin's character)
            takes over and tells the truth to the court. (the husband in
            the divorce case was Tomlin's own lawyer when he was alive so
            she knows him quite well). It's a great scene---- Martin playing
            Tomlin inside his own body. Inspiration/borrowing for <i>Liar
            Liar</i>? Not sure, but I can't watch one without thinking of
            the other.<br>
            Trivia: Jason Bernard, who played the judge in <i>LL</i>, was
            Steve Martin's best friend in <i>AOM</i>!<br>

            Last summer I studied at China with a Duquesne Univ. Program
            abroad. I'm a law student at P.R. (both civil and common law
            traditions) I went to a criminal case trial. The atmosphere was
            just the same I saw at <i>Red Corner</i>. No jury, no visitors,
            just us with special permission. The trial was really fast, I
            mean 2-3 hours. Three judges, two prosecutors and a legal representant
            provided by the PRC which probably was not even a lawyer (some
            judges even now with the new lawyers' law have never been at
            college or studied law). This woman was old and did not say a
            word through the process. The poor man was incarcerated. The
            conviction...7 years for stealing a bicycle and a cellular phone.(The
            translator told us that the real conviction should have been
            10 years but they gave him 7 because he had some Americans watching.
            Anyway I'm doing research for a paper I'm writing here on the
            accuracy of the movie and the law in China. I'll let you now
            the details when I'm done. Thanks for your page, Arlyn</font></p>

            Dear Mr. Asimow, It was a pleasure to speak with you last night
            at the CLE meeting. I have looked at your site and it is great.
            Your article on <i>Dangerous Beauty</i> is excellent. I definitely
            would like to link from teachwithmovies.org to articles on your
            site. Even if we don't recommend the film as suitable for parents
            or teachers to show to children because of violence or sex or
            historical inaccuracy, we like to provide information on the
            films. Your article on <i>Dangerous Beauty</i> is perfect. I
            don't think people need permission to link to other sites, but
            if you have a problem with it, please e-mail me. We are always
            trying to generate more traffic and would be pleased for you
            to place any of our Learning Guides on your site or to link to
            them. I am thinking particularly of the Learning Guides to <i>Inherit
            the Wind</i> and <i>Judgment at Nuremberg</i> both of which have
            a lot of substance to them. Sincerely yours, James Frieden<br>

            We viewed it as a meaningful comment on how undergraduates tend

            Paul, nice job here. I would add only a few things: 1. It was
            Cyndi Lauper, not the immaterial girl, who did the Girls Just
            Wanna Have Fun number. Persnickety, eh? 2. As pernicious as the
            notion that being smart gets you farther than learning something
            is the film's characterization of &quot;high-brow&quot; people
            as discriminatory snobs. My experience is that intelligent people
            who have actually studied something are a good deal more open
            to a variety of folk than the socially adept members of the popular
            crowd, who were deeply exclusionary. Bullies, anyone? Now they
            blame their limited adult success on the people they picked on
            in the first place-sweet.<br>

            As a previous blonde law student often compared to Marilyn Monroe,
            I was prepared to point out the inaccuracies of your review of
            Legally Blonde. A fellow writer at Picturing Justice - John Owens
            - does an ample job of explaining that this movie is based on
            reality. <br>
            See: <a href="blonde_owens.htm">/pj/blonde_owens.htm</a><br>
            The 179 LSAT score and representing a criminal defendant in court
            may not be realistic...but it allowed a plot and a lot of humor.
            This is a comedy after all...things are exaggerated. My Civil
            Procedure teacher looked and acted exactly like the one in the
            movie-even though I never saw her hit anyone on the head with
            a pencil. (Probably only because she was afraid of a battery
            charge). The essence of law school - the competition, the holier-than-thou
            attitude, the feigned serious personalities, the belittling professors,
            etc...ALL REAL.<br>
            Most importantly, what someone that looks like &quot;Barbie&quot;
            but has an IQ of 160 goes through is real. The challenges from
            their inner self and others is real. <br>
            When Callahan hit on Elle in the movie, I bawled. I lived those
            moments of self-doubt when accomplishments were invalidated by
            males. Reality is that if you are a woman with a certain look,
            especially blonde, no matter what your grades, intelligence,
            or accomplishments, people will attribute your success to being
            wanted (or sleeping) with a man. <br>
            I get a double whammy - blonde jokes and lawyer jokes. The movie
            was a refreshing reminder to me that I'm not the only person
            who goes through what Elle did. You are a man..you just couldn't
            possibly understand. Law students need all the laughs they have
            time for. Your female students could benefit from this movie
            and in particular, your blonde students.<hr align="LEFT"><b>From:

            I am a senior at Georgetown University, currently studying for
            my Constitutional Law midterm (tomorrow). In desperate need of
            a study break, I thought it would be amusing to type in &quot;The
            Law is reason free from passion&quot; - a quote from Aristotle,
            but more importantly, from my favorite movie, Legally Blonde.
            I must politely disagree with the author's conclusion - that
            she is not &quot;hip&quot; to popular culture. Had I been in
            her first year torts class, I would have been rolling on the
            ground with laughter and relief, knowing that one of my professor's
            has at least a decent sense of humor. I saw Legally Blonde for
            the first time with a 2nd year Catholic U. law student. Then
            I saw it with my father, a lawyer. I have since seen it with
            many aspiring law students and I must say, I have no idea who
            the young people were in your class, but they must lead awfully
            boring lives. I hope you get an Elle Woods in your class one
            day - near-perfect LSAT score and all.<br>

            I had the opportunity to view the film yesterday. After reading
            both movies reviews on this site, it seems to me that both authors
            acknowledge the presence of the stereotypical defense attorney
            (the best that money can buy), but neither address the probate
            and real estate attorney who is a blatant alcoholic. His life
            is pathetic: he barely pays attention to his talented daughter,
            tells his friend Crane not to have faith in the government system
            (public defender), and believes that you &quot;pay lawyers to
            mess things up and then pay them to un-mess things up.&quot;
            His character, his behaviors, and his beliefs about a failing
            justice system, where only money and lies can set you free, all
            contribute to society's increasing disbelief in our judicial
            system and<br>
            attorneys. I fully understand that this was a satirical, noir
            film and that one should not take all the characters seriously.
            However, how many people, including those who find company with
            Jerry Springer, will realize that this film attempts to portray
            lawyers with a sense of humor, instead of a sense of truth? After
            viewing the O.J. Simpson trial (and not through personal experience),
            much of society may unfortunately relate to the theory that money
            is the key to success in the courtroom and that lawyers are shysters
            that are paid to &quot;mess and un-mess&quot; things.</font></p>

            It's too bad that you raise a question without attempting to
            provide the answer, which is relatively simple. Settlement proceeds
            are to be placed in an attorney's client trust account and disbursed
            from there. Any interest made on the funds are required to be
            paid at the end of the year to the State Bar Association. These
            client trust accounts are very closely monitored and misuse of
            funds or settlement proceeds can be a basis for sanction, discipline
            or even disbarment. <br>

            Excellent article-I liked the way the other movies were brought
            up as a tie-in from big screen to small screen, then from real-life
            news to the Bartlet White House. I found one mistake-&quot;President
            Bartlet doesn't hold grudges-that's what he pays me for&quot;
            was said by Josh, not Leo. I assume this was a typo, as the next
            line begins with &quot;Josh also...&quot; I just thought I'd
            mention it. All in all, it's very well-written. I enjoyed reading
            an article that deals with the show not as something people watch
            for brain-candy during Wednesday prime-time, but as the artistic
            program it is-full of symbolism, parallels, and just plain artistic
            writing!</font></p>

            The page presented a very good review with many interesting facts
            and commentary. Is RW English? The vocabulary and composition
            felt far more English than American. So then I wondered round

            </b>Thank you for your kind words. The sun is shining in San
            Francisco, too. I am English, in that all my ancestors came from
            England, but I was born and raised in America. My maternal grandparents
            immigrated just before the Great War. My father's family came
            over about 1660, to Virginia. I sometimes feel more English than
            American, and I enjoyed the film because it portrayed a time
            when my grandmother, a suffragist, was politically active in
            England. There are several other articles about The Winslow Boy
            on the PJ site; it apparently struck a cord with our contributors.
