                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There is a fine line between
                  comedy and tragedy.  And nowhere can we see this fine line than
                  in the corporate scandals and &quot;creative accounting&quot;
                  that have been in the news, from the recent Tyco mistrial to
                  WorldCom to all the way back to the Enron debacle that is still
                  with us today.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Tyco trial certainly had
                  its moments.  These range from the allegations that a juror gave
                  an &quot;OK&quot; sign to the defense to the videotapes of Dennis
                  Kozlowski's excesses at a $2 Million party complete with male
                  and female models running about dressed as ancient Romans and
                  liquor flowing from the ice sculpted private parts of Michelangelo's
                  David.  It was definitely in bad taste and like something created
                  by Mel Brooks' - something like Brooks' <i>The Producers.</i>
                  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/Producers4.gif" width="120" height="175" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The
                  recent Broadway musical is based on Brooks' 1968 movie of the
                  same name and co-stars Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane.  It
                  is the story of Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel in the movie, Lane
                  on Broadway) who once ruled Broadway with a string of hits but
                  now who has fallen on hard times. When his accountant Leo Bloom
                  (Gene Wilder in the movie, Broderick on Broadway) arrives to
                  audit his books, Max sees the road coming to an end.  But Leo
                  discovers a loophole - a little academic accounting theory. 
                  Hypothetically speaking, a producer could make more money off
                  a flop than he ever could off a hit, but only if it was a flop.
                   If the pair can mount a show so bad that it closes on opening
                  night, they can pay off the initial costs and run off with the
                  remaining funds. They find a musical called &quot;Springtime
                  for Hitler&quot; which is &quot;guaranteed to offend everyone&quot;
                  and hence guaranteed to be a flop.  But, to their amazement and
                  eventual ruin, the show is a surprise hit!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  This is hardly a time
                  for levity.  I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts
                  of your last play.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  Where? What?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  According to the backer's
                  list you raised $60,000. But the show you produced only cost
                  fifty-eight thousand. There's two thousand dollars unaccounted
                  for.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  I went to a Turkish
                  bath, who cares?  The show was a flop. What difference does it
                  make?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  It makes a great deal
                  of difference.  That's fraud. If they found out, you could go
                  to prison.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  Why should they
                  find out? It's only two thousand dollars, Bloom, do me a favor,
                  move a few decimal points around. You can do it. You're an accountant.
                  The word 'count' is part of your title.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  But that's cheating!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  It's not cheating...
                  It's charity.  Bloom, look at me... look at me!  I'm drowning.
                  Other men sail through life. Bialystock has struck a reef. Bloom,
                  I'm going under. I am being sunk by a society that demands success,
                  when all I can offer is you. Don't send me to jail. Help! Help!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Oh dear, oh dear, oh
                  dear, oh dear.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  Help!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  All right. I'll do
                  it. I'll do it.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  Thank you, Bloom.
                  I knew I could con you.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Oh, it's all right...
                  wha?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  Nothing. Nothing.
                  Do it. Do it.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Now let's see, two
                  thousand dollars.  That isn't much. I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.
                  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested
                  in a show that flopped.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  Yes. Right. Good
                  thinking. You figure it out. I'm tired. I'm gonna take a little
                  nap. Wake me if there's a fire.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Now let' see, if we
                  add these figures, we get...</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Heh, heh, heh, amazing.
                  It's absolutely amazing. But under the right circumstances, a
                  producer could make more money with a flop than he could with
                  a hit.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Yes. Yes. It's quite
                  possible. If he were certain the show would fail, a man could
                  make a fortune.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/Producers2.jpg" width="201" height="132" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Bialystock:
                   Yes???</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Yes, what?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:   What you were
                  saying. Keep talking.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  What was I saying?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  You were saying
                  that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more
                  money with a flop than he could with a hit.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Yes, it's quite possible.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  You keep saying
                  that, but you don't tell me how. How could a producer make more
                  money with a flop than with a hit?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  It's simply a matter
                  of creative accounting. Let us assume, just for the moment, that
                  you are a dishonest man.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  Assume away!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Well, it's very easy.
                  You simply raise more money than you really need.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  What do you mean?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  You've done it yourself,
                  only you did it on a very small scale.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  What did I do?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  You raised two thousand
                  more than you needed to produce your last play.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  So what? What
                  did it get me? I'm wearing a cardboard belt.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Ahhhhhh! But that's
                  where you made your error. You didn't go all the way. You see,
                  if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  But the play only
                  cost $60,000 to produce.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Exactly. And how long
                  did it run?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  One night.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  See? You could have
                  raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop
                  and kept the rest.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  But what if the
                  play was a hit?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Oh, you'd go to jail.
                  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and
                  with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go
                  around, get it?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  Aha, aha, aha,
                  aha, aha, aha!! So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have
                  to find a sure fire flop.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  What scheme?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  What scheme? Your
                  scheme, you bloody little genius.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Oh, no. No. No. I meant
                  no scheme. I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.
                  It's just a thought.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  Bloom, worlds
                  are turned on such thoughts!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  Don't you see,
                  Bloom. Darling, Bloom, glorious Bloom, it's so simple. Step one:
                  We find the worst play in the world - a sure flop. Step two:
                  I raise a million dollars - there's a lot of little old ladies
                  in this world. Step three: You go back to work on the books.
                  Phoney lists of backers - one for the government, one for us.
                  You can do it, Bloom, you're a wizard. Step four: We open on
                  Broadway and before you can say 'step five' we close on Broadway.
                  Step six: We take our million dollars and fly to Rio de Janiero.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  But if we're caught,
                  we'll go to prison.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  You think you're
                  not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey
                  little job. Leading a grey little life.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  You're right. You're
                  absolutely right. I'm a nothing. I spend my life counting other
                  people's money - people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's
                  my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want,
                  I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Hey, we're going up.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  You bet your boots,
                  Leo. It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise.  Upward and onward.
                  Say, you'll join me. Nothing can stop us.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  I'll do it! By God,
                  I'll do it!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  This is where
                  we belong, Leo. On top of the world. Top of the world!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  Max, as I was saying,
                  maybe we should go easy on the spending. I mean these offices
                  and everything.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bialystock:  Why? Take it when
                  you can get it.  Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Bloom:  But if something should...
                  God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their
                  money back.  It would look better in court.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As with all the recent corporate
                  scandals there is a lot of money, flaunting, creative accounting
                  and most of the time investors don't get their money back.  We
                  are all familiar with the disastrous collapse of Enron, mostly
                  tragedy - part comedy - all accounting and law.  Former CEO Kenneth
                  Lay, in an August 20, 2001 interview with Business Week said,
                  &quot;There are no accounting issues, no trading issues, no reserve
                  issues, no previously unknown problem issues. The company is
                  probably in the strongest and best shape that it has ever been
                  in.  There are no surprises. We did file our 10-Q (with the Securities
                  &amp; Exchange Commission) a few days ago (Aug. 14). And, if
                  there were any serious problems, they would be in there. If there's
                  anything material and we're not reporting it, we'd be breaking
                  the law. We don't break the law.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In his Aug. 14, 2001 Lay stated
                  in E-mail to Enron employees, &quot;I have never felt better
                  about the prospects for the company... Our performance has never
                  been stronger; our business model has never been more robust;
                  our growth has never been more certain.&quot;  And in an Enron
                  press release on October 16, 2001 &quot;Our 26 percent increase
                  in [profits] shows the very strong results of our core wholesale
                  and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.&quot;
                   Three weeks later, Enron admitted that it had overstated earnings
                  by $586 million since 1997.   </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Former Enron CEO Jeff Skilling
                  talked about Enron's management with Larry King, &quot;The entire
                  management and board of Enron has been labeled everything from
                  hucksters to criminals with a complete disregard for the facts
                  and evidence assembled. These untruths shatter lives and do nothing
                  to the public understanding of what happened at Enron.&quot;
                   And in Business Week Skilling stated, &quot;We're on the side
                  of angels.&quot;  And finally he was quoted in the New York Times
                  as &quot;We're all trying to figure out what happened&#133;This
                  was a tragedy. I had no idea the company was in anything but
                  excellent shape.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In hearings before the United
                  States Senate Skilling was repeatedly criticized by Sen. Barbara
                  Boxer, who held up a placard with the joke that Skilling has
                  made during the energy crisis in California, &quot;You know what
                  the difference is between the state of California and the Titanic?
                  At least when the Titanic went down, the lights were on.&quot;
                   Boxer told Skilling,  &quot;That comment does not sit well with
                  the people of California&#133; And clearly, the Titanic was not
                  California. It turned out to be your company.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In another corporate scandal
                  former WorldCom CFO Scott Sullivan initially talked about his
                  work at WorldCom, &quot;Every time there is another move, another
                  merger, I ask myself, 'How can you top this?' and every time,
                  there has been something new to come along to offer that challenge
                  that makes this life so interesting.&quot;  When the scandal
                  was first reported Sullivan acknowledged that, &quot;This whole
                  financial story has gotten a little out of hand.&quot;  A short
                  time later WorldCom disclosed nearly $4 billion in accounting
                  irregularities - a little out of hand.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It is easy to reduce these
                  corporate problems to comedy and tragedy; the bottom line is
                  the responsibilities of corporate governors.  And we get that
                  from Dennis Kozlowski.  In May 2002, just before his indictment
                  that would end his tenure at Tyco Kozlowski gave the commencement
                  address to the graduates of St. Anselm's College in Manchester,
                  N.H.  Kozlowski told the graduates, &quot;As you go forward in
                  life, you will become leaders of families, communities and even
                  companies.  You will be confronted with questions every day that
                  test your morals. The questions will get tougher and the consequences
                  will become more severe. Think carefully, and for your sake,
                  do the right thing, not the easy thing.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">These are just a few examples
                  of &quot;the creative accounting&quot; of Leo Bloom in <i>The
                  Producers</i>.  Who knew that Mel Brooks was such a soothsayer?
                   Who knew that a 1968 movie could come back to be the hit of
                  Broadway!</font></p>
