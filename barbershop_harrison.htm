<br>
                  For African-Americans raised in the inner city and for those
                  who have escaped it for suburbia, <i>Barbershop</i> evokes images
                  and memories that are familiar and endearing. Driven by an ensemble
                  that features the big screen debut of Eve, the comic Cedric the
                  Entertainer, and screen veteran Ice Cube, plus an excellent supporting
                  cast, <i>Barbershop</i> hits all the right notes in its effort
                  to genuinely portray black America's Barnes and Noble: the barber
                  shop. Here, you can find all makes and models of the black man.
                  In fact, this movie contains about every specimen imaginable
                  and adds to it.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/barbershop.jpg" width="196" height="148" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The
                  film evolves around the character Calvin Palmer, played by rapper-actor
                  Ice Cube, as the owner of Calvin's Barbershop. The barbershop
                  was inherited by Calvin from his father, but Calvin is feeling
                  the financial pressure of operating the shop and he has his own
                  dreams of making it big through other schemes, all legitimate
                  but unfulfilled. Calvin has exhausted his bank resources because
                  he has borrowed against the business in order to finance a variety
                  of the dreams he has unsuccessfully chased.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But more burdensome than his
                  financial woes, Calvin is suffering from a lack of vision. Standing
                  behind a barber's chair every day, looking only at the customers
                  who wander into the barbershop, he loses his purpose for being
                  there. He can no longer see the value of struggling to maintain
                  this black-owned business in this bleak environment when doing
                  so requires that he constantly size up his customers only for
                  their monetary value. He refuses to be like his father, who worked
                  every day only to die broke. With his first child on the way,
                  Calvin wants desperately to provide more for his family than
                  his father could provide for him. It's this crisis that propels
                  him to do something that his father would never do: sell the
                  business.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There are other characters
                  that make this movie an instant classic. There's Ricky, the two-strikes
                  ex-con who is working in the shop and trying to keep his nose
                  clean. A young, intelligent, sensitive black man, portrayed by
                  handsome Michael Ealy, he is a reminder that in the United States,
                  1 black man in every 7 is in prison, and no matter how bright
                  you are or how hard you try, sometimes trouble finds you. Contrast
                  him to Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), the college student know-it-all
                  who is just cutting hair until he can start his life. No one
                  challenges him when he corrects them with his &quot;facts&quot;
                  (some of which turn out to be wrong), but it's clear that they
                  think less of him because he thinks less of them. You can picture
                  him in 10 years driving by the barbershop in his &quot;beemer&quot;
                  (BMW), pointing it out to his wife and kids as if it's an amusement
                  ride that he survived, totally disconnected. His appearances
                  in the neighborhood, if any, will consist of a weekday ribbon-cutting
                  ceremony commemorating a feel-good &quot;giving back to the community&quot;
                  effort he helps orchestrate. He has already sold out.<br>
<br>
                  Cedric the Entertainer plays Eddie, Calvin's connection to his
                  past and to his father. Eddie has all the history, knows all
                  about what the barbershop meant to Calvin Sr., and all about
                  the way things used to be. Although he has no customers now,
                  he is at his best when recounting the events in history that
                  had significance to black America and to the barbershop. Not
                  shy about speaking his mind, Eddie holds court on just about
                  any topic. When challenged about some of his opinions, he is
                  quick to point out that the barbershop is where any black person
                  can say anything, no matter how ridiculous. From putting Rosa
                  Parks in her place to expressing his opinion on Rodney King and
                  O.J. Simpson, Eddie churns the debate and keeps everyone honest.
                  This is truest when addressing Calvin, who at times becomes a
                  churly character who is cracking under the stress of having to
                  pay the bills.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Terri (Eve) and Isaac (Troy
                  Garity) are the objects of different elements that are present
                  in the black community: the female victim of a cheating, sweet-talking
                  man who she lets run all over her, and the white man who really
                  believes he is black because he has acquired the trappings of
                  blackness...the phat (fine) black girlfriend, the escalade (Cadillac),
                  the bling-bling (jewelry), the vernacular (&quot;yee-ah&quot;,
                  &quot;whasup&quot;, &quot;homie&quot;), and the &quot;keeping
                  it real&quot; attitude (&quot;dis is me, deal wit it&quot;).
                  While women are a relative staple in the barbershop, the white
                  man is an uncommon one (women are there largely to braid men's
                  hair; white men are there...well...why?). However, they round
                  out the personality of the surroundings, which is an important
                  statement in this film. As important is the presence of Dinka
                  (Leonard Earl Howze), an African who is fighting to understand
                  a culture that differs greatly from his, but with which he's
                  associated because of the color of his skin. Additionally, there
                  is an East Indian shop owner in Calvin's neighborhood who is
                  supported by Calvin and told to &quot;stay strong&quot; originally
                  because he sympathizes with him as a victim of the robbery around
                  which the film's story evolves. His ATM machine is stolen by
                  Ricky's cousin JD (Anthony Anderson) and his sidekick Billy (Lahmard
                  Tate). The East Indian shopkeeper later gains Calvin's respect
                  when, on a visit to his store, he learns that he has a black
                  wife and intends to remain in the neighborhood and rebuild his
                  store because of the inspiration he took from Calvin's words
                  to him. While this acceptance by a black shop owner of a East
                  Indian competitor is the biggest stretch the filmmakers ask the
                  audience to make, it's consistent with Calvin's personality and
                  thus, easier to swallow.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The antagonists round out the
                  ensemble of <i>Barbershop</i>. JD and Billy are the buffoons
                  who, after stealing the ATM machine, cart it all over town trying
                  to break into it (unaware that it is empty). JD is willing to
                  let Ricky take his third strike for his crime, by using Ricky's
                  truck and leaving the license plate behind. Lester (Keith David)
                  is Calvin's savior-turned-swindler. He offers Calvin more money
                  than he could turn down to sell him his barbershop with the promise
                  of keeping the &quot;name on the door&quot; only to find out
                  that he intended to make it a &quot;gentlemen's club&quot; called
                  The Barbershop. The remainder of the story revolves around Calvin
                  trying to give Lester his money back after Calvin changes his
                  mind about the value of the barbershop not only to him, but to
                  all his patrons who rely on it as part of their lives.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This movie could have been
                  among the genre of film that portray an inner city black man
                  as violent and criminal. While violence and crime were still
                  there, the movie had a kindlier, gentler approach to presenting
                  them. <i>Barbershop</i> expressed the tolerant atmosphere of
                  the typical neighborhood barbershop as cultural institution.<br>
<br>
                  But this movie takes an interesting look at several cultural
                  forces currently present in black America, some new, some old.
                  Of course, black women have always been present in the barbershop,
                  sometimes because their beauty shops were appendages, or because
                  they offered other services within, such as relaxers or manicures.
                  To some extent, black foreigners have been present, either from
                  the Caribbean or Africa, so that theme is also recurrent.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Newer, however, are the presence
                  of the East Indian and the assimilating white man. Both of these
                  are presented in interesting ways. The East Indian, a natural
                  enemy (or so the media would have us believe) of the traditional
                  inner city black-owned business, seems to be supported by Calvin.
                  His motivation is unclear, though. It could be because Calvin
                  sympathizes with him as a victim of common prey (the criminal),
                  or because he presents himself with common traits (a black woman),
                  or because he connects with Calvin personally by revealing to
                  Calvin what his words of support meant to him. In any event,
                  all this is going on while the other members of the barbershop
                  continue to confuse his national origin and disparage him in
                  other ways.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Isaac, however, is more complicated
                  because he is presented as the real deal. He is a white man whose
                  identity as a white person is forged with his identity as an
                  inner city resident. The tension in the movie is between him
                  and Jimmy, the black college student. In many ways, Isaac beats
                  Jimmy out on the black scale. He eventually wins respect from
                  Jimmy and everyone else at the shop, but only after he does the
                  only black thing he has left to do...give Jimmy a haircut that
                  passes the test. (Jimmy has already failed at that in a scene
                  where he gouges a hole in the hair of a young teenager because
                  of his inattentiveness.) Isaac has Jimmy pegged as a sellout
                  and offers that when Jimmy is long gone, he will still be there
                  and still be &quot;real&quot;. Now that's an interesting concept
                  to ponder. Blacks are selling out and whites are hanging behind
                  and keeping it real. Once Isaac passes the test, it's unclear
                  what effect that has on Jimmy. In a sense, it appears as if Jimmy
                  approves of Isaac as someone who can maintain the traditions
                  of the barbershop. It's not clear whether Jimmy has made that
                  decision for himself; the movie ends there. I guess Barbershop
                  II will reveal who's left to keep the tradition alive.<br>
