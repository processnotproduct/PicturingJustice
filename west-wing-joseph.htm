    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>For me as for millions of others, Wednesday nights have
    become sacrosanct. My wife and I do not go out. We do not answer the phone. Instead, we
    watch <i>The West Wing</i>. Of course, we tell each other, it&#146;s just a good show. We
    are wowed by the quality of the writing and the structure of the plots. The characters, at
    once hard-boiled and innocent, practical and idealistic, professional and yet slightly out
    of their depth, touches us. The plots, with the aid of Aaron Sorkin&#146;s keen eye and
    Dee Dee Myers&#146; insider knowledge as the show&#146;s</small><img src="images/westwing.JPG" width="320" height="228" alt="westwing.JPG (35212 bytes)" align="right" hspace="12" vspace="12"><small> consultant,
    blend fact and fiction in a way which makes us feel we are learning something real or at
    least something fundamentally true about the way in which the inner circle of the White
    House actually works.</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">But now, it is confession time. <i>The West Wing</i> is
    more than a great show. For me, an aging boomer, as for many others, the show is a
    yearning cry and a fantasy of desire fulfilled. Its President Bartlet is more than a great
    character, artfully played by Martin Sheen; he is the President Clinton who could have
    been&#150;the full expression of the intelligent, perceptive, good-hearted, visionary
    agenda-setter and change agent that Clinton can be, but without Monica Lewinsky. Bartlet
    is Clinton without Clinton&#146;s weaknesses, weaknesses that blunted his drive and
    occupied all too much of his eight years in office. Bartlet, is, in essence, the vision of
    the perfected Clinton. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Not that Bartlet doesn&#146;t have his failings too. During
    the first season we became aware that Bartlet and those around him have a tendency toward
    timidity at times and it&#146;s clear that the staff is just learning the ropes. Yet, as
    we heard towards the end of the season, the new motto is &quot;Let Bartlet be
    Bartlet,&quot; and we have no doubt that a Bartlet unleashed will be unstoppable. And with
    Mendoza on the Court, all things seem possible.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">The yearning for Bartlet is understandable. Those of us who
    think Clinton was a good President who led the country during a remarkably extended
    economic boom and showed the way during a time of fundamental technological change and
    international dislocation and reorganization, those of us who admire many of the
    President&#146;s foreign policy initiatives and domestic policies, wonder how much more
    could have been accomplished if only . . . if only.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Yet, for those too ready to sink into a reverie of Bartlet
    and the vision of the second Camelot that might have been, it&#146;s helpful, every once
    in a while, to get a dose of reality to remind us that Clinton has ways and means beyond
    those of a mere Bartlet. Don&#146;t count the President out yet.</font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><img src="images/west-wing2.jpg" width="200" height="220" alt="west-wing2.jpg (12572 bytes)" align="left" hspace="12" vspace="12"><small>Recently, <i>The West Wing</i> featured a show on the death penalty. On
    the show, as in real life, various federal death penalty provisions, enacted as parts of
    &quot;get tough on drugs&quot; initiatives, have finally resulted in the real likelihood
    that the federal government will shortly execute a federal prisoner for the first time in
    over thirty years. This puts the President directly in the cross-hairs of the death
    penalty debate. The President has pardon powers under the Constitution. Will he commute
    the sentence or will he allow the condemned to be killed?</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana"><i>The West Wing&#146;</i>s take on the matter, which was
    re-run recently, was a deeply moving mixture of morality and politics. First-term
    President Bartlet, who personally opposes the death penalty but worries both about the
    polls and about the effect of his actions on future Presidents&#146;, struggles to find
    some way to delay the execution and fails. The episode ends with Bartlet, a Catholic,
    making his confession. &quot;Bless me father, for I have sinned.&quot; We all know what
    Bartlet is thinking.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Back in real life, President Clinton faces the same issue.
    Juan Raul Garza is scheduled to be put to death on August 5, 2000. Considering the frenzy
    of the death penalty debate, the pressures on Clinton, from all sides, must be enormous.
    Clinton has his own moral views on the matter. He&#146;s also a second-term President with
    a legacy to protect and a Vice President to elect. The mix of forces, then, may not be so
    different from those working on Bartlet. Except, that, in real life, Clinton found a

    way&#150;or at least a possible path.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">On July 7, 2000, the New York Times reported that the
    administration planned to delay the Garza execution because it needs time to construct a
    set of clemency procedures to be used by federal death-row inmates and because it wants to
    review an expected Justice Department report on the issue of whether the death penalty is
    being applied in a racially neutral manner.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">The second rationale for delay is the potential hot potato
    but it comes at a time when an increasing number of Americans, even those in favor of the
    death penalty, are becoming concerned about both the accuracy of the guilt-finding process
    and the fairness of the administration of the death/life imprisonment choice. Following
    closely on the Illinois Governor&#146;s moratorium on executions and the work of the
    Innocence Project, which has, with alarming frequency, been proving convicted condemned
    inmates innocent using DNA evidence, it sometimes seems that the only person wholly
    comfortable with the present death penalty system is George W. Bush, who is apparently
    still convinced that only the guilty die in Texas.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Whether the administration of the death penalty becomes a
    meaningful political issue for the Democrats in the 2000 campaign remains to be seen. But
    even without a final resolution of this troubling issue, delay has its own rewards. Delay
    gives time to look even more carefully at the system and how it&#146;s run. If real
    problems are manifest, corrective action can be taken. From the political perspective,
    delay allows the Democrats to avoid taking a clear position (either by commuting the
    sentence or by allowing it to be carried out). The opportunity remains to keep the issue
    before the public if that seems to be working in the Democrats&#146; favor. It also allows
    the issue to be put off until after the election if that seems the better course.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Clinton is a lawyer who understands the importance of
    procedure and procedural arguments. Our system of justice demands not only that the right
    thing be done but that it be done in the right way. The country is currently beginning a
    debate on the administration of the death penalty. It needs time to jell. Delay is in
    order, but delay, with all of its virtues, is only made possible by the first
    rationale&#150;the need for clear procedures. It has been so long since the President has
    had to face a clemency decision that nobody can fault him for wanting a set of fair and
    uniform procedures in place&#150;not just for this condemned man but for all who will
    follow. Even those in favor of the death penalty can probably agree with that. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">It might be easy to be cynical about Clinton&#146;s
    actions. It&#146;s true that, without truly deciding the issue, the President has bought
    himself and his party time to do whatever they want to do in a way that will benefit them
    the most (or hurt them the least). But, whatever the device, the result is that we all
    have more time to think this issue through and to ask ourselves the hard
    questions&#150;both moral and practical&#150;that we need to ask before proceeding. In
    this real less-than-perfect world, Clinton has found a way to do what Bartlet could not. </font></small></p>

    racial and geographic disparities in the federal death penalty system.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    For Immediate Release<br>
    December 7, 2000<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I have decided to stay the execution of Juan
    Raul Garza, an<br>
    inmate on federal death row, for six months, until June, 2001, to allow the<br>
    Justice Department time to gather and properly analyze more information<br>
    about racial and geographic disparities in the federal death penalty<br>
    system.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that the death penalty is appropriate for
    the most heinous<br>
    crimes.&nbsp; As President, I have signed federal legislation that
    authorizes it<br>
    under certain circumstances.&nbsp; It is clearly, however, an issue of the
    most<br>
    serious weight.&nbsp; The penalty of death, as Justice Potter Stewart and<br>
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor have reminded us, is &quot;qualitatively
    different&quot;<br>
    from other punishments we impose.&nbsp; Whether one supports the death
    penalty<br>
    or opposes it, there should be no question that the gravity and finality of<br>
    the penalty demand that we be certain that when it is imposed, it is<br>
    imposed fairly.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have said before, supporters of capital
    punishment bear a special<br>
    responsibility to ensure the fairness of this irreversible punishment.<br>
    Further, Article II of the Constitution vests in the President the sole<br>
    authority to grant pardons and reprieves for federal crimes.&nbsp;
    Therefore, I<br>
    have approached this matter with great deliberation.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Fall, the Department of Justice released the
    results of a<br>
    statistical survey of the federal death penalty.&nbsp; It found that
    minority<br>
    defendants, and certain geographic districts, are disproportionately<br>
    represented in federal death penalty prosecutions.&nbsp; As the Deputy
    Attorney<br>
    General said at the time the survey was released, no one confronted with<br>
    those statistics can help but be troubled by those disparities.&nbsp; We do
    not,<br>
    however, fully understand what lies behind those statistics.&nbsp; The
    Attorney<br>
    General has said that more information and a broader analysis are needed to<br>
    better interpret the data we now have and to determine whether the<br>
    disparities that are evident reflect any bias in our system.&nbsp; She has<br>
    undertaken an effort to gather and analyze the relevant information, so<br>
    than an appropriate decision can be made on the question of bias.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a close and careful review of this issue, and
    after conferring<br>
    with the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General, I am not<br>
    satisfied that, given the uncertainty that exists, it is appropriate to go<br>
    forward with an execution in a case that may implicate the very issues at<br>
    the center of that uncertainty.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In issuing this stay, I have not decided that the
    death penalty should<br>
    not be imposed in this case, in which heinous crimes were proved.&nbsp; Nor
    have<br>
    I decided to halt all executions in the federal system.&nbsp; I have simply<br>
    concluded that the examination of possible racial and regional bias should<br>
    be completed before the United States goes forward with an execution in a<br>
    case that may implicate the very questions raised by the Justice<br>
    Department's continuing study.&nbsp; In this area there is no room for
    error.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have asked that the Attorney General report to
    the President by the<br>
    end of April 2001 on the Justice Department's analysis of the racial and<br>
    geographic disparities in federal death penalty prosecutions.<br>
