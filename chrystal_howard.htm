                  </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The independent film <i>Chrystal</i>
                  begins with the return of Joe (Billy Bob Thornton) to his rural
                  Arkansas home after a long stretch in prison for drug charges.
                  He returns carrying some dark baggage: we learn he was arrested
                  sixteen years ago after he wrecked his car during a police chase
                  (&quot;if he hadn't been drunk, it would've killed him&quot;,
                  says Joe's cousin and friend, Larry). His wife Chrystal (Lisa
                  Blount) and boy were passengers and the crash left her with a
                  broken neck and their boy dead, thrown through the windshield
                  into the dark woods and never found. Larry (Walton Goggins) theorizes
                  that wild animals must have dragged the body away (&quot;You
                  would of thought they would of found something, a leg bone or
                  shoe or something,&quot; he says). Chrystal is left with constant,
                  relentless physical and emotional pain and finds temporary amnesia
                  in impersonal, random sexual encounters. A local fortune teller
                  (Kathryn Howell) tells her, &quot;You've got that child in your
                  neck. You can take that metaphorically or literally. But you
                  got to get that child out of your neck.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/chrystal.jpg" width="99" height="140" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Chrystal's
                  desperate efforts to do just that, interwoven with Joe's search
                  for redemption, are the backbone of the story.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After Joe returns home he and
                  Chrystal make halting, unsure attempts to reach out to each other
                  and possibly move on (Joe gets a job as a welder and at one point,
                  in a bizarre scene, even suggests they have another child). However,
                  a big space of nothingness between them and other events conspire
                  to prevent anything close to a seamless &quot;happily-ever-after&quot;
                  story from unfolding.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Joe is encouraged by Larry
                  to get back into the marijuana growing business (the only work
                  available, and the only work that pays well, Larry points out).
                  Larry reminds Joe he was renowned for the kick-ass weed he used
                  to cultivate. &quot;I have a green thumb,&quot; Joe matter-of-factly
                  responds. The very rumor that Joe is back in the pot business
                  brings in, almost simultaneously, the local law, the DEA, and
                  an old nemesis, Snake (writer-director Ray McKinnon), an always
                  hyped-up, crank-snorting back-woods drug dealer. McKinnon plays
                  such a high-wire paranoid character that every time he appeared
                  on screen I automatically leaned back far into my seat. Snake
                  exudes danger and unpredictable violence and he's the perfect
                  foil for the low-key, introverted Joe. Billy Bob Thornton and
                  Ray McKinnon are superb and eat up every scene they're in, separately,
                  or especially, together.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Against this backdrop some
                  remarkable characters are introduced: Charlie Cato (James Intveld),
                  a kindly, sensitive, nuanced sheriff who falls in love with Chrystal;
                  Pa Da (in a wonderful cameo by Harry Dean Stanton) provides some
                  Ozark front-porch philosophy and bluegrass music; Chrystal's
                  tough/tender mother, Gladys (Grace Zabriskie), who obviously
                  holds no great affection for Joe and attempts to provide a modicum
                  of emotional stability for her daughter; and the aforementioned
                  cousin, Larry (Walton Goggins) who boasts of his fantastic connections
                  with the local drug culture. There are many other great characters,
                  but one stands out: Kalid (Harry Lennix), a blind musicologist
                  from Chicago who is writing a book on indigenous mountain music.
                  It is Kalid, as you might suspect, who can see things more clearly
                  than anyone. And it is Kalid who helps Chrystal replenish her
                  mountain roots and reconnect with the mystery, mythology, poetry,
                  music, and her love of the Arkansas Ozarks. The scene in which
                  Chrystal sings an old time mountain ballad (and it really is
                  Lisa Blount singing) on Pa Da's front porch is touching and brilliant.
                  Lisa Blount, like Billy Bob Thornton an Arkansas native, is brilliant
                  in her role as Chrystal, a woman on the brink of madness, overwhelmed
                  with pain and grief, and alternating between bottomless depression
                  and outraged anger.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The movie was filmed around
                  Eureka Springs, Arkansas. But to those hoping to see some picturesque
                  sites of this beautiful bed &amp; breakfast mountain village,
                  you won't. Although some truly magnificent outdoor mountain scenes
                  are shown, this film mostly stays rooted in the dark shady lurking
                  hollows and inside the dilapidated shacks and word-of-mouth fried
                  catfish joints. Indeed &quot;the setting is one of the main characters&quot;
                  McKinnon points out in an interview on the film's <a href="http://www.chrystalthemovie.com/">web
                  page</a>. Fittingly many of the scenes in <i>Chrystal</i> are
                  long, contemplative, and slow. We are drawn into a narrative
                  where things quietly unravel and the very locale invites us to
                  linger and sit on the porch for a spell. But, ironically, through
                  this quiet unraveling we become active participants in the film,
                  not passive observers waiting for something to be done to and
                  for us.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This is not to say there is
                  no &quot;action&quot; in <i>Chrystal</i>. There is, but even
                  this takes on a quite different meaning than the usual hero-centered
                  slam-bam action of mainstream movies (the fight scene between
                  Snake and Joe is quite unique). And the film is laced with humor,
                  some dark and surprising humor, and some hillbilly-based humor
                  (in the fight scene Joe taunts Snake by accusing him of marrying
                  one of his own sisters: &quot;Well,&quot; Joe says, &quot;at
                  least you don't have to worry about looking too far outside your
                  family for a date on Saturday night&quot;). Snake comes closest
                  to a hillbilly stereotype (although Ray McKinnon has said &quot;Our
                  characters are archetypes not stereotypes&quot;), but McKinnon
                  is too skillful an actor to go over the top. Snake is indeed
                  a character you could plop, albeit with different lingo, dress,
                  mannerisms, into, say, the drug-dealing inner-city streets of
                  any major city where devastating unemployment and hopelessness
                  has been part of the atmosphere for decades.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Given the culture of the region
                  and a do-it-yourself tradition of justice we can see how Joe's
                  search for redemption leads to its logical, tragic conclusion.
                  Ending with, well, not to give too much away, a form of victim-precipitated
                  homicide. In a film dealing with outsiders (by choice or circumstance),
                  strange as it may sound, I saw Joe's final desperate act coming,
                  but I was still surprised.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Movies, of course, can have
                  quite an impact on viewers' perceptions of law and justice, and
                  <i>Chrystal</i>'s story of an ex-con attempting to readjust to
                  life after prison is no exception. However, writer/director McKinnon
                  does not present a dichotomized world of good guys versus bad
                  guys, although the struggle of good vs. evil does exist (Snake
                  takes the prize for evil). Much to McKinnon's credit in between
                  these two extremes he portrays characters experiencing a great
                  deal of very human pain and confusion, groping and uncertainty.
                  In addition, McKinnon could have easily presented Sheriff Charlie
                  Cato (James Intveld) as a caricature in the tradition of redneck
                  &quot;moonshine&quot; movies. But interestingly the sheriff comes
                  across as a &quot;good&quot; guy. He's presented as a kindly,
                  caring center of stability, decency, and common sense (demonstrating
                  downright &quot;soft&quot; skills) who balances out the story's
                  structure.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">On the other hand, the &quot;feds,&quot;
                  the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officials, although
                  they don't come off as exactly &quot;bad&quot; guys, do fit nicely
                  into images of law enforcement represented by some segments of
                  the general public and popular culture. The DEA is portrayed
                  as an intrusive force who overreach and spend considerable time
                  (and, the implication is, taxpayers' money) going after the &quot;little&quot;
                  guys. After a massive busting-down-the-door DEA raid on Joe's
                  shack of a house (and finding no drugs) Sheriff Cato sarcastically
                  asks one of the DEA officers, &quot;Well, did you break the big
                  drug Cartel tonight?&quot; Isn't this typical of the red-state
                  political climate of the time, the local &quot;good guys&quot;
                  versus the distant, cut-off-from-the-mainstream bumbling &quot;bad
                  guys&quot;?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The final scene of <i>Chrystal
                  </i>is even more emblematic given the structure of the story.
                  The final shot shows the sheriff's young daughter (named Ophelia)
                  climbing up a strange yard sculpture Joe welded together out
                  of scrap metal, pipes and chains, car and machinery parts, and
                  other discarded objects he had collected during yard clean-up
                  after his return home. On the very top sits a tricycle (his boy's),
                  jutting out like the beak of a strange bird in flight, welded
                  to the bizarre sculpture. The girl climbs to the top and mounts
                  the tricycle and pedals furiously into the setting sun, wheels
                  spinning in the air, going nowhere.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Ray McKinnon and his team (Ginny
                  Mule Pictures, which consists of Lisa Blount, his wife, and Walton
                  Goggins; winners, by the way, of an 2002 Academy Award for best
                  live action short film, <i>The Accountant</i>) have put together
                  a film that borrows from many southern literary traditions (Horton
                  Foote's <i>Tender Mercies</i> meets <i>Thunder Road</i> comes
                  to mind) and archetypical motifs right out of Joseph Campbell.
                  But comparisons do this film a disservice. <i>Chrystal</i> is
                  firmly in the tradition of independent film making and provides
                  us with a thought-provoking, conversation-generating movie experience.
                  That itself makes <i>Chrystal</i> truly unique.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Sundance Film Festival
                  premiered <i>Chrystal</i> in 2004 and the film is now hitting
                  the theaters for limited release. I saw it with a very appreciative
                  audience at a theater in Fayetteville, Arkansas. What happens
                  next to Chrystal is up to First Look Media, who own the distribution
                  rights, and the moving-going public. I would urge the public,
                  movie-going or not, to see this gem of a picture.<hr align="LEFT"></font></p>
