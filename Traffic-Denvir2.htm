    &nbsp;&nbsp; Stephen Soderbergh's hit &quot;Traffic&quot; illustrates a
    dilemma which confronts all of us at one time or another. Where does
    commendable loyalty to the group end and disloyalty to your own ideals
    begin? &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <spacer size="36" type="HORIZONTAL">
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp; There are four protagonists in &quot;Traffic.&quot; First,
    Robert Wakefield <img border="0" src="toro.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="229" height="187">(Michael
    Douglas), the federal judge who is appointed to be the national &quot;drug
    czar. The second is Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), who is a
    Mexican cop in Tijuana fighting the drug cartels. The third is Helen Ayala
    (Catherine Zeta- Jones), who starts the movie as a La Jolla housewife. And
    finally there is Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle), who is an agent in the U.S.
    Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Each is faced with facts which show that his
    or her group is at worst corrupt, or at least ineffective in achieving its
    designated goal. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    </font>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><spacer size="36" type="HORIZONTAL">
    
    Wakefield slowly discovers from personal experience that the much-publicized
    &quot;war on drugs&quot; is not being won. His own daughter becomes an
    addict and his dealings with her problem finally convince him that the whole
    &quot;war&quot; metaphor is misplaced when you are talking about your own
    child. She doesn't need a warrior; she needs a father. Wakefield resolves
    the tension between the policies promoted by his organization and his own
    analysis of what drug addicts need by resigning his prestigious position to
    return home to help his daughter. It's not an easy decision because he has
    up till then been an outspoken supporter of the old policy; also one
    suspects he will pay a political price for his change of heart. Soderbergh
    portrays Wakefield as a hero.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    </font>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><spacer size="36" type="HORIZONTAL">
    
    Rodriguez faces an even more difficult dilemma. Everywhere he looks he finds
    corruption. At first, he and his partner sign up with the forces of the
    Mexican drug czar to help him shut down the Tijuana drug cartel. He is a
    zealous employee until he discovers that the Mexican drug czar himself is in
    the employ of a rival drug cartel. Furthermore, his partner has sold
    information to the American DEA, an act which culminates in the partner's
    death. How do you reconcile loyalty and ideals in a pervasively corrupt
    institutional culture? Forced to make up his own rules, Rodriguez finally
    decides to sell the information on the whereabouts of the corrupt Mexican
    drug czar to the DEA, but for a price--that the DEA build a new baseball
    field for the kids in Tijuana. Still, he feels like a traitor betraying an
    employer who has always treated him well. But in the morally compromised
    world in which he lives, he's a hero and Soderbergh shows him as such..
    &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    </font>&nbsp; <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><img border="0" src="zita.JPG" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="230" height="190"><spacer size="36" type="HORIZONTAL">
    
    Helen Ayala is the pregnant wife of a successful La Jolla business man who
    finds out that the husband is a major drug lord. She discovers the truth
    when federal agents pull her husband from their home. Her group is the
    family, and she has to face the fact that the family is firmly connected
    with large-scale criminal activity. She decides to accept the corruption and
    fight for her husband's release, even if that requires conspiring to murder
    a key witness. Ayala is hardly a hero, but Soderbergh does permit us to
    understand her dilemma and her attempt to choose between unpalatable
    alternatives. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    </font>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><spacer size="36" type="HORIZONTAL">
    
    </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">My problem is with
    Soderbergh's portrayal of Montel Gordon. He portrays Gordon as a hero even
    though the logic of the movie shows him to be a fool. Unlike the other
    protagonists he has no sense of the morally ambiguous climate in which he
    operates. The film time and time again insists on the ineffectiveness of the
    War on Drugs. Gordon himself is reminded at least twice that any supply he
    confiscates is quickly replaced by other smugglers and that this war can't
    be won. Still Gordon chooses the path of denial and continues the game of
    cops and robbers even after it has resulted in his partner's death. The last
    scene of the movie shows Gordon smiling to himself as he leaves the home of
    the drug dealer who ordered his partner's death, having planted a bug. The
    audience is invited to share in Gordon's anticipation of revenge for his
    partner's death, even though his obsessive pursuit of &quot;bad guys&quot;
    will certainly do damage to the Fourth Amendment and might well end with
    Gordon's own death. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    </font>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><spacer size="36" type="HORIZONTAL">
    
    Why does Soderbergh paste on the &quot;smiley face&quot; ending? One
    possible is that he shares Gordon's satisfaction that the bug has been
    planted and that the War on Drugs will continue, but, as I have indicated,
    this is very hard to believe within the structure of the rest of the movie
    ,which shows that the War on Drugs cannot be won. Another possibility is
    that Soderbergh is playing with the audience, allowing us to see through his
    happy ending to the film's darker implications. Good art sometimes makes you
    work to understand it. I hope that is true, but still cannot dismiss the
    possibility of a more cynical explanation. Soderbergh has shown Gordon and
    his partner as classic Hollywood &quot;buddies.&quot; Audiences expect one
    buddy to revenge the death of another. Soderbergh decided to satisfy this
    audience expectation, even if it undercut the message of his film. &nbsp;</font><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><spacer size="36" type="HORIZONTAL">
    
    If the third explanation is the correct one, we must admit that Soderbergh
    would not be the first artist to dampen his message to improve his profits.
    Preston Sturges did the same thing in the ending of &quot;Sullivan's
    Travels&quot; and Shakespeare tacked on an incomprehensible happy ending to
    &quot;Measure for Measure.&quot; Still it seems a shame. As the
    &quot;Traffic&quot; advertisements say, &quot; No one comes out clean.&quot;
    Least of all the director.</font></p>
