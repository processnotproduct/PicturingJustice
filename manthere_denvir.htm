                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Coen brothers have created
                  another entry in the Hollywood Sleazy Lawyers Hall of Fame. His
                  name is Freddie Reidenschnieder (Tony Shaloub) and he proudly
                  stands against almost every ethical precept the legal profession
                  cherishes. He's avaricious, has little respect for facts, and
                  thinks his client's guilt or innocence irrelevant. The audience
                  loves him-and so do lawyers.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/manthere2.jpg" width="222" height="148" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">That
                  the general public should enjoy Freddie is no surprise, since
                  we are told that the public dislikes lawyers. But that lawyers
                  also should find Freddie somehow attractive is more surprising.
                  Yet no less an authority than PJ's own Michael Asimow refers
                  to Freddie as a &quot;loveable sleaze.&quot; Why might that be?<br>
<br>
                  First, I think Freddie catches a truth about the self-image of
                  lawyers, which is often ignored. Good lawyers know that they
                  aren't selfless pilgrims on a quest for objective truth; they
                  know themselves to be Tricksters, putting out whatever version
                  of the truth that best serves their clients' interests. Freddie
                  says out loud what the profession only admits by indirection-the
                  spin is the thing. Therefore, &quot;truth&quot; is always a product
                  to be constructed, not a fact to be discovered. Even the facts
                  are constructed.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Law schools tell us that law
                  requires certainty, but lawyers know that the practice of law
                  thrives on uncertainty. Lawyers revel in ambiguity because it
                  gives license to their creativity. Old Christopher Columbus Langdell
                  tried to convince us that law is a science with its own rigorous
                  methodology. Freddie knows it's a narrative art, more like that
                  of a screenwriter than a natural scientist.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Another reason lawyers might
                  admire Freddie is that he's having such a good time practicing
                  his profession. He knows he's a performer and he can't wait for
                  show time. For him law is more an aesthetic endeavor than a moral
                  or ethical one. Regardless of the innocence or guilt of the defendant,
                  it's the performance that counts. From an aesthetic viewpoint,
                  there's greater joy in freeing a guilty man than an innocent
                  one. Anyone can do the latter, but getting a &quot;not guilty&quot;
                  for a guilty client is law's version of a 360-degree under-the-basket
                  slam-dunk.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The third reason why lawyers
                  love Freddie is because they know he's really only a fictional
                  character; he doesn't exist is real life. Little of what is really
                  important in law takes place in the courtroom before the jury.
                  Most law, including criminal trials, is one long negotiation
                  that seldom ends up before the jury. And even the mythical Freddie-like
                  performance of O.J. Simpson's dream team turns out in reality
                  to have more to do with the fact-driven science of jury selection
                  than high flights of rhetoric. Most lawyers, good lawyers, spend
                  their days ferreting out facts through endless interrogatories
                  rather than destroying witnesses with withering cross-examinations.
                  Let's face it: &quot;bureaucratic&quot; is probably a more apt
                  term than &quot;aesthetic&quot; to describe the daily routine
                  of the legal profession.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">And, of course, there are always
                  the moral quandaries that Freddie ignores, but which real lawyers
                  have to face. Freddie doesn't care about ethics, but real-life
                  lawyers do. They don't really like it when good people go to
                  jail or bad people go free.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">&quot;Punching cows&quot; is
                  hard, dirty, low-paying work. Still, I'll bet that doesn't stop
                  &quot;real&quot; cowboys from enjoying a John Wayne movie once
                  in a while.<br>
