                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Paul Bergman<br>
<br>
                  <i>The Jury</i> is an hour-long TV drama that debuted in June
                  2004.  Its interesting premise is to focus on jury deliberations
                  and flash back to events and bits of testimony as jurors refer
                  to them.  The opening episode did not stay entirely true to its
                  premise.  For example, we see the lawyers plea bargaining even
                  though this of course occurs outside the jurors' presence.  And
                  in what to me was the biggest copout, after the verdict is in
                  we see what really happened.  Nevertheless, the show is a creative
                  effort to make viewers feel a part of a jury, and it backs the
                  effort up by inviting viewers to cast votes by phone (and perhaps
                  website) before the show ends.    </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/jury.jpg" width="145" height="150" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">I'll
                  first focus on a couple of the dramatic elements.  I was bothered,
                  as I usually am, by the rapid cuts from one juror to another
                  and from a juror to testimony or to a quick glimpse of events.
                   As a result, for me the deliberations consisted too often of
                  exchanges of sound bites and not real opinions.  Also, while
                  the judge, court personnel and attorneys will apparently carry
                  over from one episode to the next, I understand that each episode
                  will focus on a different group of jurors.  As I watched, it
                  occurred to me that it might be interesting to see how the same
                  jurors would react to entirely different sets of facts.  That
                  would enable us as viewers to identify more strongly with particular
                  characters and to see how jurors' experiences and philosophies
                  react in a variety of factual settings.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The case about which the jurors
                  deliberated was carefully constructed so that almost any inference
                  one juror put forward could be countered by an equal and opposite
                  inference.  For example, one juror mentions that an argument
                  between the defendant and the shooting victim during a pickup
                  basketball game furnished a motive for the defendant to deliberately
                  shoot the victim.  Another juror's quick riposte to the comment
                  is along the lines of &quot;I'd argue all the time when playing
                  sports- that doesn't mean I was going to kill anyone.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The result for me was that
                  the show had a checklist feel to it.  Need a motive-- check.
                   Need to be able to undermine the motive-- check.  Need the defendant's
                  fingerprints on the gun-- check.  Need to show that it was possible
                  that the defendant's two friends might have fired the fatal shot--
                  check.  What this checklist approach eliminated almost entirely
                  was the &quot;value added&quot; of the lawyers.  Any decent trial
                  attorney would package the disparate factual elements into a
                  narrative structure that explained what happened, why it happened
                  and how it happened.  For example, I don't recall any juror mentioning
                  how long before the shooting the pickup game argument took place,
                  and without that information the jurors cannot formulate or accept
                  a story about the pickup game argument providing a motive for
                  the shooting.  This episode of <i>The Jury</i>, perhaps owing
                  to its format, is almost entirely narrative-free.  Indeed it's
                  an anti-story, with pieces of testimony and glimpses of events
                  present only to offset each other.    </font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I also don't recall any juror
                  saying the words &quot;reasonable doubt.&quot;  Can the defense
                  lawyer have done such a bad job during the trial that none of
                  the jurors talked about reasonable doubt during the deliberations?
                   Maybe.  The defendant was shown testifying, and given the weaknesses
                  in the prosecution's case I would think any defense attorney
                  would have walked over hot coals in an effort to persuade the
                  defendant not to testify.  But this was a reasonable doubt case
                  from the get-go, and the lack of attention to it during the deliberations
                  reflects the anti-narrative weakness of the episode.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Jury</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> has potential and I wish it well.
                   Let's hope the network doesn't file a Motion to Dismiss. <br>
