                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Current legislation dealing
                  with genetics revolves around privacy issues and discrimination
                  associated with the information that can be collected from ones
                  genetic makeup. The legislature has decided to address this issue
                  even though genetic research is still in its infancy and little
                  is known about how predictable ones genetics are to the outcome
                  of one's life. I believe that the legislature could stand to
                  learn a lot from two movies that delve into the possible outcomes
                  of genetic research. These movies are the 90's sci-fi drama <i>Gattaca</i>
                  and the late 80's comedy <i>Twins</i>. On the surface, these
                  movies may seem very random to be comparing, but I believe that
                  by comparing the different ways in which the characters deal
                  with their genetic inferiority, these movies can offer us insight
                  into the future of genetics (A notable similarity that lends
                  these movies to comparison is that Danny DeVito produced <i>Gattaca</i>
                  and stared in <i>Twins</i>. Furthermore, DeVito's character in
                  <i>Twins</i> is genetically inferior and shares the same name
                  as the genetically inferior character in <i>Gattaca</i>. Therefore,
                  Danny DeVito may very well have wanted us to compare these two
                  movies.).<br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/gattaca.jpg" width="98" height="140" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"><i>Gattaca</i> is set in a not
                  so distant future where the majority of babies are produced in
                  test tubes to insure genetic perfection. The story centers on
                  a natural birth baby (who is referred to as &quot;de-gene-erates&quot;)
                  named Vincent. At Vincent's birth the doctors inform his parents
                  that he will die at the age of 30 due to having a gene for a
                  heart defect. Vincent's parents' next child, Antoine, is genetically
                  engineered and the doctor informs his parents when they are purchasing
                  him, &quot;The child is still you - just the best of you.&quot;
                  Antoine quickly becomes his father's favorite. The two children
                  often pit themselves against each other in a game of chicken,
                  in which they swim as far away from the shore as possible until
                  one of them turns around and comes back. As the genetics have
                  predicted, the weaker Vincent always turns around first. When
                  not playing chicken Vincent obsesses about becoming an astronaut;
                  his dreams are crushed by his father who tells him that with
                  his heart the only way he is ever getting on a rocket is to clean
                  it. That night Vincent and Antoine play chicken again; however,
                  this time Vincent wins. <br>
<br>
                  The rest of the story revolves around Vincent assuming the identity
                  of Jerome (who is genetic perfection, but was paralyzed in an
                  accident). Vincent works his way to the top of the space program
                  (which is named Gattaca); one week before he is scheduled to
                  go into space a murder takes place at Gattaca. Detectives, known
                  as &quot;Hoovers&quot; or &quot;J. Edgars,&quot; (Had the movie
                  been made post 9/11 a better name for the intrusive detectives
                  may have been &quot;homeland security.&quot;) find an eyelash
                  of Vincent's and throughout the rest of the movie he struggles
                  to evade and outsmart their attempts at genetic testing.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Gattaca</i> addresses many of the issues raised by the Code
                  of Georgia and California Civil Code, most notably privacy of
                  genetic testing. In <i>Gattaca</i> it is illegal for companies
                  to hire based on genetics, but it is widely accepted that the
                  practice goes on anyway. Vincent puts it best when he says that
                  in the future they have &quot;discrimination down to a science.&quot;
                  Vincent's interview with the company consists of a pin prick
                  to his thumb. With one drop of blood Vincent is hired, or more
                  accurately Jerome is hired. <i>Gattaca</i> makes it clear that
                  even if it is against the law to discriminate because of genetics,
                  people will still find a way to do so. This is an easy premise
                  to accept since in today's world programs like affirmative action
                  are needed to keep people from discriminating, and even then
                  they are inadequate. Perhaps one day affirmative action will
                  not depend on the color of one's skin but instead on one's genetics.<br>
<br>
                  Vincent comes from a Benjamin Franklin/Rocky Balboa school of
                  thought and with good ole' fashioned American hard work and ingenuity
                  he is able to prove that there is no gene for the human spirit.
                  In one of the final scenes Vincent confronts his brother, Antoine,
                  who is now a detective working on the Gattaca murder. Antoine
                  still does not respect his brother and the two have one last
                  sibling &quot;pissing contest&quot; by playing a game of chicken.
                  After the two have swam so far out that they can not see the
                  shore Antoine begins to get worried and asks Vincent how he did
                  it, how he beat him when they were kids. Vincent replies, &quot;I
                  never saved anything for the way back.&quot; Eventually, Vincent
                  beats his brother once again and finally earns his respect. The
                  drive behind Vincent's intestinal fortitude is further explained
                  when he tells his love interest (who is genetically engineered
                  but suffers a minor heart problem that will not allow her to
                  go to space) that &quot;they have you looking so hard for any
                  flaw; that after awhile that is all that you see.&quot; Vincent
                  however, does not dwell on his flaw, he is fixated on his dream
                  of making it to space. In the end Vincent's drive for his dream
                  inspires many others, including Jerome who thanks Vincent for
                  sharing it with him.<br>
<br>
                  The plight of Jerome is symbolic in that no matter how genetically
                  perfect we are designed to be, we can never escape fate. After
                  winning a silver medal in swimming Jerome attempts to kill himself
                  but instead he becomes paralyzed. Jerome refers to his life as
                  &quot;the burden of perfection.&quot; In his final scene he commits
                  suicide in an incinerator while wearing the silver medal. Interestingly,
                  Jerome is arguably one of the more human characters in the movie
                  - he drinks too much, smokes too much, is moody and in the end
                  he destroys himself. Jerome was programmed to handle everything
                  except for failure and when he fails, he reverts to a life that
                  more closely resembles humanity. He becomes obsessed with helping
                  Vincent reach his dream and through watching Vincent overcome
                  his failures, Jerome finds a purpose in what he views as his
                  failed life. Yet, in the end he kills himself and serves as one
                  of the more disturbing aspects of this movie. He does not find
                  the strength to live through Vincent; he only finds strength
                  to finish what he had failed at previously - suicide. (Thus Jerome
                  comes from the Sylvia Plath school of thought - substitute an
                  incinerator for an oven.) I believe that Jerome's suicide shows
                  that behind perfect genetics will always lie an imperfect human,
                  ready to surface as soon as the fa&ccedil;ade of perfection cracks.
                  Sadly no act except suicide could show how human Jerome is -
                  it is an act that only humanity is capable of performing.<br>
<br>
                  Much like Vincent's world, our society may soon be told of our
                  genetic pre-dispositions and what we can and cannot accomplish.
                  If we dwell on this, as many of the characters in the film do,
                  then we will lose what is truly most human about us, our ability
                  to rise above what we are capable of accomplishing.<br>
<br>
                  While less intellectual on the surface, <i>Twins</i> still raises
                  some important issues on topic of genetic discrimination. The
                  story revolves around a genetic superman (a Nietzschian Zarathustra
                  if you will) Julius, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger and his
                  twin brother Vincent, played by Danny DeVito. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/twins.jpg" width="92" height="140" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">DeVito's Vincent is horny, deceitful,
                  cynical, weak, unintelligent, and his life is controlled by the
                  quest for money. Meanwhile, Julius is innocent, strong, intelligent,
                  not driven by money and not as preoccupied with sex. (Although
                  this may be because he is a virgin for 4/5 of the movie and is
                  unaware of what he is missing out on). While both characters
                  are technically &quot;genetically engineered&quot; it is clear
                  through Julius's isolated upbringing and Vincent's big city life
                  that Vincent is the personification of humanity, while Julius
                  is separate from humanity.<br>
<br>
                  The doctor who was behind the experiment that produced Vincent
                  and Julius informs Vincent that he is the &quot;crap left over&quot;
                  from Julius and berates him about his inferiority. It is a sad
                  and telling moment in the movie as Vincent realizes that he is
                  a collection of what the doctor felt were the most undesirable
                  characteristics a human could have. Nevertheless, when Julius
                  confesses that his life is &quot;all theory - no practice&quot;
                  we see that humanity still has something to offer the world that
                  genetic perfection cannot provide. Vincent is able to overcome
                  his &quot;weaknesses&quot; with his life experiences. If Vincent
                  had not been forced to struggle throughout his life he never
                  would have been able to survive. Vincent's strength is reminiscent
                  of Charles Bukowski, who once wrote that the worse thing that
                  could happen to a young poet would be &quot;a rich father, an
                  early marriage, an early success or the ability to do anything
                  well.&quot; Bukowski recognized that without pain and failure
                  one would have nothing to offer to the world of poetry. Likewise,
                  it is clear that Vincent would have nothing to offer to the world
                  if he had not endured such a tumultuous life. <br>
<br>
                  Throughout <i>Twins</i>, Julius and Vincent are shown having
                  the same idiosyncratic habits (i.e. scratching their butts in
                  unison). This shows the inescapability of not only ones family
                  but of ones humanity. No matter how &quot;perfect&quot; of an
                  upbringing Julius has had, he still has an indefinable similarity
                  to Vincent. Both characters can sense when the other is in trouble;
                  it is not just the more intelligent Julius who is capable of
                  this sixth sense but Vincent as well. The two are tied together
                  no matter how separate people have tried to keep them. The movie
                  ends with the Twins' mother saying, &quot;I just can't get over
                  how alike they are.&quot; Thus in the end despite all the genetic
                  engineering, the &quot;worst&quot; of humanity is no different
                  than the &quot;best&quot; of it. Science is unable to separate
                  the two into separate spheres.<br>
<br>
                  <i>Gattaca</i>'s Vincent and <i>Twins</i>' Vincent offer two
                  different views of how humanity will be able to survive the advancement
                  of genetics. <i>Gattaca</i>'s Vincent offers an American in the
                  truest sense of the word; cut from the same stone as Fredrick
                  Douglass, Rudy and Oprah. He shows us that there is no gene for
                  the human spirit and that with enough heart we can reach the
                  loftiest of goals. <i>Twins</i>' Vincent is in stark contrast
                  in that he does not compete with the genetically perfected, he
                  merely has different strengths. <i>Twins</i>' Vincent is a product
                  of the Beat generation. He does not deny what makes him human
                  and he does not suppress his lusts for women, money and booze.
                  Instead, he embraces them and teaches us that experience can
                  never be genetically engineered. <br>
<br>
                  As genetic engineering progresses and humanity is forced to look
                  at what defines us, these movies show that we are much more than
                  a collection of genes. We are an imperfect, indefinable life
                  form who without faults and shortcomings would cease to be human.
                  The more conscious of this we are as a society, the more apt
                  we will be in deciding how to use the powers of genetics. <br>
<br>
                  Author's Note: If you still doubt the possible influence of these
                  movies, it is important to consider that Arnold Schwarzenegger's
                  involvement in <i>Twins</i> coupled with his current position
