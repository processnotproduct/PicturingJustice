            that lawyers are all slimebags, we instead see in movies like
            <i>Young Mr. Lincoln</i> a more favorable image of the lawyer
            and a less favorable image of the law. Usually we have a noble
            lawyer fighting to find justice within a corrupt system of law.</font></center>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As Presidents' day approaches,
                  maybe we can use film to get a new perspective on Abraham Lincoln's
                  view of law. We all know that Nixon earned his nickname &quot;Tricky
                  Dick,&quot; but maybe the same adjective could be applied to
                  another lawyer president, Abraham Lincoln, at least as he is
                  portrayed in John Ford's classic <i>Young Mr. Lincoln</i>.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/lincoln.jpg" width="120" height="212" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Ford's
                  movie portrays a Lincoln ambivalent towards law, sometimes almost
                  contemptuous of its sonorous banalities. For instance, our first
                  sight of him practicing law involves dispute about a small amount
                  of money. Abe first structures a settlement that would not require
                  litigation and then playfully, but meaningfully, threatens both
                  parties with physical violence if they do not agree to the deal.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">We next see him as the judge
                  of the pie contest at the county fair. Here Ford allows Lincoln
                  to put on a burlesque of judging. First, he tastes the peach
                  pie and likes it; then he tastes the apple pie and thinks he
                  likes that even more, but then he feels it his duty as judge
                  to give the peach pie one more taste, and on it goes. I think
                  here we can see three messages. First, the judge doesn't want
                  the contest to end before he's had his fill of the evidence.
                  Secondly, the whole idea of judging as choosing one side of the
                  argument as totally &quot;right&quot; is silly. And Ford is also
                  showing us that the law often forces citizens to make impossible
                  decisions. In the movie, for instance, the mother of Lincoln's
                  clients is required by the law to choose which of her two sons
                  she will see executed.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Soon thereafter, we see Lincoln
                  once again impishly fiddling with the rules. Here he is on the
                  weaker side of a &quot;tug 'o war&quot; at the fair; he cleverly
                  rescues victory from defeat by hitching his side's end of the
                  rope to a passing wagon heading in the opposite direction.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Of course, the central scene
                  in the movie is Lincoln's famous cross-examination of a hostile
                  witness in which he uses the Farmer's Almanac to show that moon
                  was dark at the time the witness said its brightness allowed
                  him to identify Lincoln's client. This, of course, is an example
                  of admirable lawyerly trickery. But once he has destroyed the
                  credibility of the witness, Lincoln goes on to bully him in the
                  best Perry Mason fashion to confess to the murder. Substantive
                  justice is done, but little attention is paid to the niceties
                  of legal procedure.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Within the structure of <i>Young
                  Mr. Lincol</i>n it turns out that the hero must save society
                  from two evils. One is the evil of mob violence that presents
                  itself in the form of a lynch mob screaming for blood. This scene,
                  which anticipates the stand against the mob of another lawyer,
                  Atticus Finch in <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, is usually interpreted
                  as a paean to the rule of law, but actually, it's not law, but
                  the Abe's courage to face down the mob which is the operative
                  moral force. The second evil is the law of homicide that requires
                  the execution of both sons with little concern that at best only
                  one of them committed the murder. Once again it's the lawyer
                  who saves the day for justice.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Of course, it's not too surprising
                  that Ford should show Abraham Lincoln as a hero, lawyer or not.
                  But when we think about it, the structure of <i>Young Mr. Lincoln</i>
                  is the structure of most trial movies. Instead of the conventional
                  idea that lawyers are all slimebags, we instead see in movies
                  like <i>Young Mr. Lincoln</i> a more favorable image of the lawyer
                  and a less favorable image of the law. Usually we have a noble
                  lawyer fighting to find justice within a corrupt system of law.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Maybe the layman movie audience
                  sees a social reality that lawyers themselves too often miss.
                  Most people don't experience law as a rational system of rules
                  aiming towards justice, but as the unpredictable exercise of
                  arbitrary state power. They like lawyers best when we stand with
                  them against the law in hope of justice.<br>
