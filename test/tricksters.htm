    <i><b><p align="JUSTIFY">by John Denvir, USF Law School </b></i>(December 1998)&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was considering applying to law school in the
    1960's, the most popular &quot;lawyer&quot; show on television was &quot;The
    Defenders&quot; starring E.G.Marshall and Robert Reed as a father-son law firm
    specializing in defending righteous causes. (See David Papke&#146;s excellent essay on
    &quot;The Defenders&quot; in Jarvis and Joseph&#146;s<i> Prime Time Law</i>.) Now the most
    popular &quot;lawyer show&quot; is &quot;Ally McBeal,&quot; a weekly hour-long
    &quot;lawyer joke.&quot; Come to think of it, there was no such thing as a &quot;lawyer
    joke&quot; in the 60's. Times have changed, as they say.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the negative image of lawyers which we see in all
    the media can be traced to a basic misunderstanding in the public mind about the role
    lawyers play in American society. Unfortunately, it is a misunderstanding that too many
    lawyers share.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/Copy_of_980921clinton_video2.jpg" alt="Copy of 980921clinton_video2.jpg (10848 bytes)" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="252" height="189">Every culture needs what anthropologists call &quot;the
    trickster,&quot; the person who is able to challenge the legitimacy of conventional wisdom
    and traditional pieties. He was called Hermes in Greece, Mercury in Rome; Native Americans
    called this mythic personage &quot;coyote&quot; and he appears as &quot;Brer Rabbit&quot;
    in African-American folk tales. The trickster, unlike a magician, cannot change physical
    reality, but he can change our perceptions of it. Often that&#146;s more important.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; I think lawyers play the &quot;trickster&quot; role in
    American culture. Let me give two examples. One illustration comes from my own field of
    constitutional law where there is currently a debate going on over what constitutes an
    &quot;impeachable&quot; offense. More specifically, does perjury or lying under oath by
    the president constitute an impeachable offense? </p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; Defenders of President Clinton have had a hard time with
    this issue. First, the text doesn&#146;t help. It speaks of &quot;reason, bribery, and
    other high crimes and misdemeanors.&quot; Perjury bears a strong resemblance to treason
    and bribery, all three being crimes against the public order. Even worse for Clinton is
    the historical fact that federal judges have actually been successfully impeached for the
    crime of lying to a grand jury. If lying to a grand jury is an impeachable offense for a
    judge, so too it must be for a president. That seems as clear as two plus two equals four.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#146;s here where &quot;trickster&quot; Washington
    lawyer Lloyd Cutler enters the fray. (See his op-ed in the November 9th New York Times).
    Cutler points out three distinctions between impeaching a president and impeaching a
    federal judge. First, since judges serve for life, it&#146;s either impeachment or
    allowing the evil-doer life tenure. A President only serves four years. Secondly, <img src="images/Copy_of_clinton.jpg" alt="Copy of clinton.jpg (10727 bytes)" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="190" height="225">a judge&#146;s main work is overseeing trials in which witnesses testify
    under oath. A conviction of perjury undermines his or her ability to perform this
    function. But a President has a different job description, one in which deception
    sometimes may be necessary. Finally, since a judge&#146;s duties are fairly
    noncontroversial, we don&#146;t worry about impeachment being used to settle what is
    really a policy dispute. We very much worry about political enemies misusing impeachment
    to punish a president whose policies they abhor. </p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, we start to see that two plus two does not
    always equal four. Maybe perjury should be a &quot; high crime&quot; for a judge but not
    for a president.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; My second example is better known. It involves the
    prosecution of a famous ex-athlete for the murder of his wife. At first, the case seemed
    open and shut. Not only was there a history of marital violence and clear evidence of the
    defendant&#146;s blood at the murder scene, but also the whole nation had witnessed a
    bizarre motor cavalcade while the defendant considered whether or not to kill himself,
    hardly the actions of an innocent man.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp; The prosecution had every reason for confidence until they ran
    into a trickster named Johnny Cochran. They discovered too late that the case was not
    about wife-beating or the infallibility of DNA testing, but about racist cops and poorly
    trained lab assistants. The result was a quick &quot;Not Guilty.&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; In both examples, we see a lawyer using his professional
    skills to change perceptions. That&#146;s the trickster&#146;s trade.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let&#146;s admit at the outset that the trickster is
    not a moral person in any conventional sense of the word; his loyalty is to his client,
    not the community. I have little doubt that Cutler would sing a different song were his
    client a federal judge. So too, whether or not O.J. Simpson actually committed the murder
    was probably of limited interest to Cochran. He had a case to try.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/cochran1.gif" alt="cochran1.gif (23679 bytes)" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="216" height="145">But let&#146;s also be clear that the community gains from the
    trickster&#146;s labors. The trickster expands reality, allowing us to see imaginative
    potential which conventional wisdom ignores. We can still impeach Clinton or convict
    Simpson; that&#146;s our decision, not the lawyer&#146;s. The lawyer just allows us to
    envision some alternative endings. And even if we rule against their client, Cutler
    enriches our understanding of the Constitution and Cochran forces us to confront problems
    too long ignored. </p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; But while the trickster may not always be moral, he does
    have an ethic. He must live a paradox, stretching language without destroying it. Language
    and rational argument are the tools of his trade. To make a mockery of them is a
    self-destructive act. Here I think lawyer Bill Clinton serves as a powerful negative
    example.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#146;s pretty well assumed now that Clinton lied under
    oath when he was asked about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. People do lie; people
    do lie under oath. But Clinton has gone even further, claiming that his lies were
    &quot;legally accurate.&quot; Now the trickster starts to chew on his own tale.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; How will legal discourse continue under the Clinton
    concept of &quot;legal accuracy&quot;? Let me give you an example from history. You will
    remember there was another lawyer trickster named Nixon<img src="images/Copy_of_nixon.jpg" alt="Copy of nixon.jpg (10427 bytes)" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="229" height="208"> who once made a clear statement: &quot;I am not a crook!&quot; Of course,
    that statement also turned out to be a lie, but at least it had the virtue of being able
    to be proved true or false. Under the Clinton definition of &quot;legally accurate,&quot;
    we will have an infinite regress of questions. &quot;Mr. President, when you say
    &#145;I&#146; are you referring to yourself or the person you would like to be?&quot;
    &quot;Could you be more precise in your definition of &quot;crook&quot;? Should we
    understand that to mean only that you have never actually been convicted of a
    felony?&quot; And President Clinton has already instructed us on all the possible meanings
    that can be silently ascribed to a simple word like &quot;am.&quot;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp; So for me, Clinton&#146;s crime is much worse than
    perjury: he has tried to kill the possibility of human communication, the very medium in
    which lawyers work. It&#146;s not an impeachable offense, but neither is it lawyering in
    any acceptable sense of the word. </p>
