            is that it highlighted some real issues about juries. It was
            very good in underlining how wretchedly unpleasant it can be
            for jurors to be cooped up in jury rooms wrangling for days with
            obnoxious people they can't stand and who seem to be completely
            irrational. The episode raises serious questions about whether
            our commitment to juries in civil cases makes any sense.</font></center>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Let's face it. The life of
                  judges is really boring. Trial judges just sit up there on the
                  bench, hammer their gavel, rule on motions, sustain or overrule
                  evidentiary objections, instruct the jury, and go to lunch. They
                  are almost completely passive, not active like the lawyers. By
                  comparison, the life of appellate judges is even more boring.
                  They spend their day reading briefs, listening to oral argument,
                  and writing opinions. As a result, a TV series based on the life
                  of trial or appellate judges is likely to be a real snoozer.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/queens4.jpg" width="112" height="181" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">The
                  fate of the two Supreme Court series that debuted last year (<i>First
                  Monday</i> and <i>The Court</i>) was a bad omen. They were killed
                  after a few episodes. The writers tried to liven them up with
                  sex among the clerks and bickering among the justices, but it
                  just didn't work. On the other hand, <i>Judging Amy</i> has been
                  a modest success. The shows do a decent job of exploring real
                  issues in juvenile and family law. People seem interested in
                  the life of judge Amy Gray (and her children, ex-husband, boyfriends
                  and her gay court clerk). In my opinion, the key to the show's
                  success is Amy's mother Maxine Gray (played by Tyne Daly). Maxine
                  is a social worker and each week's show juxtaposes the social
                  work angle and the legal angle. To me, at least, the social work
                  segment is more interesting and carries the show. <i>Judging
                  Amy</i> thus resembles <i>Law &amp; Order</i> which somehow hit
                  on a winning combination by combining police work and prosecution
                  work in each episode.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">And then there are the daytime
                  judge shows, led by <i>Judge Judy</i> and her numerous clones.
                  These shows are a phenomenal ratings success, with <i>Judge Judy</i>
                  often pulling the highest ratings on daytime TV. The reasons
                  for this success are somewhat obscure. Evidently the daytime
                  TV audience enjoys a voyeuristic look into the tacky problems
                  of the real litigants who duke it out on the show. They seem
                  to welcome receiving bite-size lessons in legal rules. More important,
                  the audience seems to get off on the highly injudicious behavior
                  of the daytime TV judges. Judy Scheindlin berates the litigants
                  for their stupidity and bad manners. Meanwhile, she unashamedly
                  articulates her own moral values and those of her audience (&quot;how
                  come you keep getting pregnant when you can't support the kids
                  you already have?&quot;) But the bottom line is that the audience
                  seems to like watching these judges at work.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So, there's hope for a new
                  TV series about the life of trial judges, right? <i>Queens Supreme</i>
                  is CBS' bet that people care about what judges do. Personally,
                  I don't think so and predict a quick death for the new show,
                  but what do I know? Even network executives have a terrible record
                  in predicting whether particular pop culture products will find
                  a market--so people like us in the peanut gallery aren't likely
                  to do any better.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The fundamental problem in
                  writing a show about trial judges is to avoid dwelling on the
                  unspeakably tedious work that judges actually do and instead
                  find some way to inject sex and violence into each episode. The
                  debut of <i>Queens Supreme</i> did that capably and, I grudgingly
                  admit, I kind of enjoyed it. The episode focuses on Judge Jack
                  Moran, played by Oliver Platt. I have always enjoyed Platt's
                  work and I thought he did a bangup job in the debut episode.
<br>
                  Judge Moran is trying a tort case arising out of a death at a
                  quit-smoking clinic. The jury is hopelessly hung. The jurors
                  really hate each other, particularly one particularly obnoxious
                  juror who is holding out for the plaintiff. He argues that the
                  cold-turkey therapy at the clinic caused a fatal heart attack.
                  Needless to say, that juror is himself a heavy smoker who is
                  having withdrawal symptoms since he can't smoke in the jury room.
                  Jurors who are voting for the defense seem almost equally obnoxious
                  including a preachy high school teacher.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">While Judge Moran administers
                  the &quot;Allen charge&quot; (designed to get the jurors to compromise
                  and come up with a unanimous verdict), the obnoxious juror goes
                  berserk, grabs the bailiff's gun, and holds the judge, jurors
                  and court personnel hostage. Although the hostage-taker never
                  figures out what he is trying to do, the episode generates some
                  real suspense. Judge Moran is packing his own heat and a lot
                  of tension arises from whether he's going to go for his gun and
                  shoot it out with the juror.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A back story during this episode
                  concerns Judge Moran's pending divorce. The show opens with his
                  wife trying to get the judge to sign the final divorce papers
                  which he doesn't want to do. And the episode ends with them going
                  to dinner. Left open is whether they're going to give their marriage
                  one more try. So--episode one managed to inject both sex and
                  violence into the humdrum life of big city trial judges. But,
                  to be honest, the funny parts weren't really very funny and the
                  drama parts weren't all that dramatic.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">One thing I liked about the
                  show is that it highlighted some real issues about juries. It
                  was very good in underlining how wretchedly unpleasant it can
                  be for jurors to be cooped up in jury rooms wrangling for days
                  with obnoxious people they can't stand and who seem to be completely
                  irrational. The episode raises serious questions about whether
                  our commitment to juries in civil cases makes any sense. Just
                  about nobody else in the world uses juries for cases of this
                  kind. Juries are inefficient, expensive, irrational, and vastly
                  slow up the civil litigation process. They are also a huge intrusion
                  on the lives of ordinary people. We no longer conscript soldiers
                  and we don't force you to vote. Why, exactly, are we still forcing
                  people to serve on civil juries (aside from the fact that civil
                  juries are protected by the Seventh Amendment)?</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So, good luck to <i>Queens
                  Supreme</i>. I suggest you catch it before it's cancelled.</font></p>
