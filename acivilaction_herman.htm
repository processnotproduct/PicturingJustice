                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Justyna Herman</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After practicing law as a civil
                  trial lawyer for twenty years, Lee Taft, the former dean of the
                  Harvard Divinity School, came to the conclusion that something
                  must be missing in our system of law because even after successful
                  settlements, the wronged clients are not satisfied with the outcome.
                  In his essay entitled &quot;Apology Subverted: The Commodification
                  of Apology,&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">1</a>) he states that
                  what he realised after all his years in practice in the field
                  of injury law is that people need meaningful apology from the
                  wrongdoers in order to fully recover from the inflicted wrongs.
                  This realisation came to him after he handled a medical malpractice
                  case. A young widow was left with small children and scarce resources
                  because of the negligence of doctors in handing her husband's
                  illness. This widow was extremely disappointed that none of the
                  doctors that contributed to the agonizing death of her husband
                  came forward with an apology. To her, this was a moral harm,
                  another injury that was added to the malpractice. <br>
<br>
                  <img src="images/acivilaction.jpg" width="166" height="110" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">A similar thought
                  is presented in the 1998 movie <i>A Civil Action</i>, directed
                  by Stephen Zailian and based on a best-selling book by Jonathan
                  Harr under the same title. The portrayal of justice that the
                  movie conveys is not just the stereotypical or deformed depiction
                  of the legal profession and the legal system that Hollywood movies
                  tend to portray. Instead, the movie seems to suggest that in
                  our adversary system of law, where two opposing sides fight with
                  the sole intention to win, there is no place for apology. This
                  contention has a strong resonance not only in legal philosophy
                  but also among lawyers. <br>
<br>
                  <i>A Civil Action</i> depicts a civil lawsuit that takes place
                  in the United States. The lawsuit is filed by residents of a
                  small town, Woburn, in Massachusetts, against two powerful corporations,
                  Beatrice Foods and W.R. Grace, for polluting the water in the
                  local river and causing the deaths of many children. The plaintiffs'
                  legal representation is a small law firm specializing in personal
                  injury law. On the opposite side, two big and powerful Boston
                  law firms employing Harvard graduates and professors represent
                  equally powerful and rich defendant corporations. <br>
<br>
                  Not surprisingly, the small law firm runs out of resources and
                  puts its partners and employees on the verge of bankruptcy. The
                  Woburn case proves to be extremely expensive; it gets out of
                  hand and has to enter the court system because the parties can't
                  agree on a settlement and their negotiations prior to trial are
                  highly unsuccessful. The goal of the small law firm and Jan Schlichtmann,
                  who is actively defending the interests of his clients, is to
                  reach settlement and avoid trial. Schlichtmann's tactic - to
                  extract as much money as possible from the big corporations before
                  the trial - is simple in that he believed that the big corporations
                  would want to settle the issue quickly and without much attention
                  because of the fear that a trial would attract too many litigants.
                  Another reason for Schlichtmann's tactic is that he thought that
                  the corporations would want to avoid the trial because they wouldn't
                  want the jury to be able to hear emotional testimony from the
                  plaintiffs whose children died because of the polluted water.
<br>
<br>
                  Unfortunately for Schlichtmann, his law firm and his clients,
                  the corporations' counsel don't take Schlichtmann's bait. Instead,
                  they decide to go to trial with the intention of never having
                  to listen to the testimony of the parents about the agonizing
                  deaths of their children, which could potentially cost them a
                  lot of money. The big corporations win on this issue and the
                  judge decides to put to the jury three questions of a complicated,
                  technical nature in order to resolve the case. The jury finds
                  in favour of Beatrice Foods, but finds W.R. Grace guilty. <br>
<br>
                  The methods that the defendants resort to in running this trial,
                  including their mischievous defence tactics and manipulations
                  of the judge, show that the adversary system is an enemy of truth
                  finding. One of the reasons that Schlichtmann loses the trial
                  and fails at the negotiations with W.R. Grace after the trial
                  is that he underestimates the intellect and cunningness of the
                  opposing counsel. What this movie seems to be saying, however,
                  is that the most important reason that Schlichtmann loses is
                  because he doesn't listen to his clients. From the beginning
                  of the movie it is clear that all that the plaintiffs want is
                  an apology from the big corporations. Schlichtmann either doesn't
                  seem to listen, because he is putting his sights on the big compensation
                  that he wants for his clients and for himself, or he simply disregards
                  the wishes of his clients because he knows that there is absolutely
                  no room for apology in the adversary system. Possibly, the concept
                  of apology in the adversary system is either beyond grasp or
                  just doesn't exist. <br>
<br>
                  Carl Schneider writes (<a href="#footnotes">2</a>) that there
                  are three elements of apology: acknowledgement, assent, and vulnerability.
                  Without any of those elements, there is no true apology. Similarly,
                  Nicholas Tavuchis outlines (<a href="#footnotes">3</a>) the foundation
                  for a true apology as consisting of three steps: the offender
                  must be able to name the offence, then the offender has to admit
                  fault and, finally, express remorse for the result of his or
                  her act and the harm it caused. The remorse and regret necessarily
                  include willingness to change on the part of the offender and
                  agreement to accept all consequences. By looking at all the requirements
                  of apology, it becomes obvious that there is an important moral
                  quality in apology. Taft says that &quot;[a]pology is moral because
                  it acknowledges the existence of right and wrong and confirms
                  that a norm of right behaviour has been broken. It is moral (&#133;)
                  because the person who apologises also exposes himself to the
                  consequences of his wrongful act.&quot; (<a href="#footnotes">4</a>)<br>
<br>
                  Seeing as apology is such an onerous course of action, it is
                  of no surprise that apology is avoided in the adversary system.
                  Lazare says (<a href="#footnotes">5</a>) that &quot;the greatest
                  impediment to apology is a pervasive cultural attitude that views
                  apology as a weakness, an emotional expression antithetical to
                  traditional American values of autonomy and independence.&quot;
                  Another impediment that is especially significant in a litigation
                  context is the perception that apology is, as a matter of fact,
                  an admission of guilt. This is critical in litigation, as admission
                  of guilt can jeopardise defence in a court case. Defendants are
                  discouraged from apologising because if they do, they automatically
                  put the blame on themselves and, as a consequence, they close
                  the door to a fair trial or fair sentencing by an objective (in
                  theory) trier of fact because, by apologising, the defendants
                  convict themselves and let the plaintiffs sentence them. Moreover,
                  apologising before trial can potentially open the door to an
                  unlimited number of litigants claiming the same harm as was inflicted
                  upon the plaintiffs. <br>
<br>
                  Some lawyers (<a href="#footnotes">6</a>) admit that apology
                  is important and should be encouraged. However, what they often
                  advocate is a modified apology, such that it avoids the admission
                  of wrongdoing. An infamous example of this type of apology is
                  one made by President Nixon, who said: &quot;I regret deeply
                  any injuries that may have been done in the course of events
                  that have led to this decision. I would say only that if some
                  of my judgments were wrong, they were made in what I believed
                  at the time to be in the best interest of the nation.&quot;(<a href="#footnotes">7</a>) What makes this apology unsuccessful
                  is that it doesn't include the important elements of apology
                  such as acknowledgement of wrongdoing. What aggravates the situation
                  even more is that Nixon asserted that the wrong was done for
                  a greater good. Even though this type of apology is widely practiced
                  every day, it is by no means a successful apology. Therefore,
                  the existence of two types of apology, one true one and one that
                  is missing the central element of acknowledgement, poses a difficult
                  dilemma for the adversary system. Accepting the former type means
                  foregoing the court system. Deciding to settle for the second,
                  defective one may result in a successful court action, but it
                  will never satisfy the harmed plaintiffs. This dilemma is portrayed
                  in <i>A Civil Action</i>. The defendants do not want to apologise
                  or even settle the case out of court by paying out compensation
                  to the harmed parents because of the fear of opening the floodgates
                  of litigation. <br>
<br>
                  Anne Anderson, the spokeperson for the plaintiffs, tells Jan
                  Schlichtmann that she only wants an apology from the defendants.
                  In response to that, Jan says that corporations apologise with
                  money. To Anne, this is simply not enough. She wants somebody
                  to acknowledge the harm that was done to her family and to other
                  families in Woburn. Unfortunately, there is no one forthcoming
                  with an apology but Jan. However, Jan doesn't seem to understand
                  Anne's desire for an apology. His apology to her is not only
                  unsuccessful, but adds further insult to Anne's injury. What
                  this illustrates is that for Jan, a lawyer, apology is not natural
                  in litigation. What is natural for Jan is that defendants have
                  the right not to incriminate themselves and to defend themselves
                  as best as they can. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, have the
                  right to pursue compensation, which is the most prevalent method
                  of reimbursement for the suffered wrongs. <br>
<br>
                  While Anne's quest for apology can be perceived as a tactic to
                  avoid having to put a price on the lives of children in her community,
                  it is a perfectly good response for somebody who is not money-oriented
                  and refuses to acknowledge and agree with the compensatory aspect
                  of law. It could be argued that she is forced to enter the court
                  system because this is the only way that big corporations will
                  notice a claimant. Therefore, even though the plaintiffs decide
                  to go to court, apology might really be what the plaintiffs want.
                  A recent newspaper article confirms this proposition: <br>
                  &quot;[apology is] a surprisingly powerful way to soothe patients
                  and head off malpractice lawsuits. The hospitals in the University
                  of Michigan Health System have been encouraging doctors since
                  2002 to apologize for mistakes. This system's annual attorney
                  fees have dropped from $3 million (U.S.) to $1 million, and malpractice
                  lawsuits and notices of intent to sue have fallen from 262 filed
                  in 2001 to about 130 per year&quot;.(<a href="#footnotes">8</a>)</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In spite of all this, Anne's
                  extraordinary request for apology may seem daunting, especially
                  in the face of the enormous amounts of money in legal bills that
                  she and other families owe to Jan for taking on the case. Because
                  Jan's firm practiced collecting on the payment from successful
                  settlements or rewards, surely it was impossible for Jan to pay
                  off the debts that his firm incurred with an apology from the
                  defendants.<br>
<br>
                  A scenario like that would only be possible if Jan's firm had
                  plenty of resources and took the case pro bono, thereby not expecting
                  compensation. This is not to say, however, that apology is only
                  possible in the case of wealthy law firms who take on cases pro
                  bono. Rather, it is to show that while it is a recognized practice
                  in our legal system that people are to be compensated with money
                  for deaths, misfortunes and harms, it is a legitimate expectation
                  on their part to also expect that the party who harmed them acknowledges
                  the harm. Whether the harmed party wants monetary compensation
                  or not, apart from wanting apology, <i>A Civil Action</i> seems
                  to be saying that apology is not possible in the adversary system.
<br>
<br>
                  What <i>A Civil Action</i> is saying, however, might not be correct
                  in all situations. Even though the situation shown in the film
                  is not likely to yield an apology, in some situations, such as
                  medical malpractice, there would appear to be a place in the
                  legal system for an apology. In other situations, as in the corporate
                  case depicted in the film, which involves a corporation and not
                  one individual who has committed the wrong, a faceless company
                  in other words, a meaningful apology may not be very likely to
                  take place or be very feasible. After all, the heads of a corporation
                  have a responsibility to their stockholders to guard the financial
                  well-being of the company and should try to protect those interests
                  whether they are right or wrong, lest the stockholders have to
                  pay the financial price for their mistakes. Moreover, apology
                  in the cases of medical malpractice, like the one described by
                  Lee Taft or The Globe and Mail piece might not pose the issue
                  of opening the floodgates because a negligent doctor usually
                  harms only one person, the patient.<br>
<br>
                  Court processes don't encourage meaningful apologies. Rather,
                  it is clear that there is little room in the court system for
                  apologizing because it may be treated as an admission of guilt
                  which, in turn, may easily lead to a finding of liability. This
                  is very unfortunate, because it is natural for people to expect
                  an apology for the inflicted harm. Inasmuch as this can be achieved
                  in out-of-court reconciliation processes, such as mediation,
                  it cannot be done in the adversary system because of the risk
                  of creating prejudice against the defendants and thus denying
                  them the right to a fair trial. While defendants can be encouraged
                  to apologise for wrongs as a means for avoiding trial altogether,
                  as the above The Globe and Mail article suggests, the defendants
                  are placing themselves in a vulnerable position. <i>A Civil Action</i>
                  illustrates this problem all too well. <hr align="LEFT"></font><br>
