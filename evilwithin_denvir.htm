            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by John Denvir</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The New York Times reported
            recently that the interim government in Afghanistan recently
            released more than 320 Taliban fighters. Hamid Kazhai, the leader
            of the government, dismissed his former enemies with the statement,
            &quot;Go home, and lead peaceful lives.&quot; I am struck by
            the strong contrast between Mr. Kazhai's actions and those of
            the American government towards John Walker Lindh, the Marin
            teen-ager who went to Afghanistan and eventually fought with
            the Taliban. While the Afghanistan government is wishing its
            former enemies good luck, we are hoping to imprison young Mr.Lindh
            for what might be 60 or 70 years.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/searchers.jpg" width="132" height="182" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">I
            think John Ford's great Western <i>The Searchers</i> can shed
            some light on America's harsh treatment of young Mr. Lindh. The
            movie centers around the charismatic but troubled character of
            Ethan Edwards, played by that American icon of maleness, John
            Wayne.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Ethan is a loner who returns
            to his family in Texas after serving as an officer in the confederate
            army. We are immediately drawn to Ethan because he embodies many
            of the virtues we value in the American character. He is smart,
            tough, and loyal. He's more a man of action than words, but we
            sense that he dearly loves his family.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Shortly after Ethan's return
            to Texas, his family is killed by a Commanche war party. The

            only survivor appears to be his little niece Debbie who the Commanches
            take with them. Accompanied only by the family's adopted part-Indian
            son Martin Pawley, Ethan begins the long search to save Debbie
            and take revenge on the savages who killed his family.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">We learn a good deal about
            Ethan during the search, which goes on over five years. We see
            that he is the epitome of the resourceful American frontier hero,
            relentless in pursuit of his goal. He's convinced he will succeed
            because while Commanches will eventually stop, he never will.
<br>
<br>
            But slowly our respect for his perseverance starts to diminish.
            His need for revenge seems more and more an obsession like that
            of the mad Captain Ahab with his whale. Once it becomes clear
            that Debbie has become a wife to a Commanche chief, the goal
            of rescue mutates into the need to kill her. Martin, who started
            the trek to save Debbie from the Commanches, ends it by saving
            her from her uncle's fury.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I think we can see some parallels
            between Mr. Walker's plight and that of Debbie. It's true that
            Walker was not abducted; he went to Afghanistan of his own will.
            But he went on a religious quest to study Islam, not to attack
            America. He had no connection to Osama bin Laden or the September
            11 bombings. It was America's bombing which precipitated his
            involvement in the war. He saw the Taliban as victims of American
            aggression. Like Debbie, he found himself in the wrong place
            at the wrong time.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I think the character of Ethan
            has relevance to our government's treatment of Mr. Walker. Something
            went wrong in Ethan when he found out that Debbie was not just
            a captive, but she was a squaw. A man who started out on a courageous
            quest to save a little girl finished it trying to kill her. Ethan
            felt that Debbie's cohabiting with a Native American infected
            her with evil. Ethan thinks that he can eradicate the evil by
            killing Debbie, but the viewer recognizes that the evil against
            which Ethan fights lies partly within his own tortured mind.</font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">I should point out that at
            the end of the movie Ford has Ethan relent and even finally save
            Debbie. It's not a very satisfactory ending, probably motivated
            more by John Wayne's star image than the logic of the plot. But
            we can always hope. <br>
