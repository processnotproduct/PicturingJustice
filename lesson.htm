    <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some goals are
    so worthy that it is glorious even to fail. Atticus Finch may have failed to achieve
    justice for Tom Robinson, but he helped change the society that wrongfully convicted Tom. <em>To
    Kill a Mockingbird</em> is set in Georgia during the Depression, a time and place in which
    racism was so rampant that it destroyed any chance for African-Americans to obtain a fair
    trial. Even though the rule of law stated that blacks had rights and were entitled to due<img src="images/mockingbird1.JPG" alt="mockingbird1.JPG (28584 bytes)" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="216" height="201"> process, the social code
    of the South said that blacks were second class citizens. Atticus Finch refused to play by
    the social rules, and in doing so changed the minds of the community and gave life to the
    rule of law.</small></font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Social rules
    had greater force than the rule of law in the Jim Crow South, even when the social rule
    came in direct conflict with the rule of law. A true-life example is the manner in which
    Southerners, even Southern governors, adhered to the social rule that blacks and whites
    should not go to school together after the passage of the <i>Brown</i> decisions and the
    subsequent deployment of the National Guard. </small></font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The same
    defiance of the law in favor of supporting social rules is ever present in <em>To Kill a
    Mockingbird</em>. The plot of the movie hinges on the consequences stemming from Mayella
    Ewell&#146;s violation of the stringent sexual code of the South. Mayella breaks the
    sexual code by being attracted to and, more importantly, coming on to a black man, Tom
    Robinson. Mayella knew that if the public learned of her actions, the community to which
    she and her family already only marginally belonged would ostracize her. When caught, the
    only way for her to avoid the shame that will surely envelop her and her family was to lie
    and accuse Tom of rape. Her father, Bob Ewell, either conceived of or condoned the rape
    accusation because he too feared the inevitable public chastisement. The Ewell family thus
    falsely accuses an innocent man and commits perjury simply because the rule that is most
    relevant to their lives is not the rule of law, but rather the social rules of their
    society. In short, to them it didn&#146;t matter that they were breaking the law because
    to break the social code of the time would bring about much harsher consequences.</small></font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mayella and
    her father were able to perpetuate this fraud because they knew that the community, like
    them, would ignore the law and remain faithful to the Southern social code. Tom
    Robinson&#146;s trial is merely an extension of <img src="images/mockingbird2.JPG" alt="mockingbird2.JPG (48177 bytes)" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="299" height="167">the Ewells&#146; fraud. From
    the very beginning the trial is a sham; no reasonable man who witnessed Atticus
    Finch&#146;s near-perfect defense could have believed beyond a reasonable doubt that Tom
    attempted to rape Mayella. The jury knew Tom was innocent, but under the social rules of
    the South, it was less of a sin to convict an innocent (black) man than to publicly
    believe a black man&#146;s story over a white man&#146;s. It is worthy of note that this
    is a society whose not too distant past outlawed blacks from ever testifying in court.
    Thus, even though the rule of law had changed, the practical effect remained the same
    because the social rules hadn&#146;t changed. From this we see that the law is lifeless
    unless supported by social rules. Therefore, the only way for the rule of law to reign
    supreme is for racist temperaments to be completely eradicated from our belief system.</small></font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Removing
    racist sentiments from our social beliefs is a daunting but necessary task, for the rule
    of law is only effective when it can be objective, and it can only be objective when a the
    minds and hearts of the community have been changed. Atticus&#146; actions are an example
    of a man who tried to change the minds of his society by refusing to accede to its racist
    rules. Atticus provided Tom with laudable representation in court, a task that ran
    contrary to the dominant social rules of the time, and hoped to obtain a just result on
    appeal. Even though he lost at the trial level, this approach allowed Atticus to retain
    his reputation as a just and reasonable man. </small></font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reviews of
    Atticus&#146; legal strategy have criticized Atticus&#146; failure to do exactly what was
    needed to win, such as petitioning for a removal to federal court or filing a writ to
    challenge the all-white jury. Such critiques are mistaken, for Atticus knew the ultimate
    goal was not just to acquit Tom but rather to free the society from the racism that
    imprisoned all African-Americans. Atticus knew that the best way to change society was
    from within. Had Atticus chosen a more aggressive approach to the Robinson case, his
    society would have seen him as too radical and rejected both him and the beliefs he
    advocated. Atticus, as an outcast, would thus be unable to change society and, in turn,
    unable to create an effective and impartial justice system. Viewed from this perspective,
    Atticus&#146; strategy was not a legal misstep but rather an example of effective
    advocacy. </small></font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; However wise
    Atticus&#146; tactics may have been, his actions would have been done in vain if he failed
    to change people&#146;s attitudes. Through his conduct, Atticus prevents his children from
    adopting the racist beliefs of their society. This is exemplified by an exchange between
    Jem and Tom Robinson&#146;s son. Tom&#146;s son approaches Jem, who is waiting in
    Atticus&#146; car as Atticus discusses Tom&#146;s case with Mrs. Robinson inside her
    house. The two boys lock eyes, and Jem gently raises his hand in a wave. This simple yet
    poetic gesture communicates Jem&#146;s realization that he and Tom&#146;s son are alike,
    are equals. This realization is clearly influenced by Atticus&#146; representation of Tom
    as well as by Atticus&#146; continual exhortation to &quot;not judge a man until you have
    walked a day in his shoes.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; Atticus was
    not only able to prevent his children from assenting to the racist social code, but he was
    also able to change the beliefs of Maycomb&#146;s sheriff. At the beginning of the film,
    the sheriff is a willing player in the racist system. He accepts Bob Ewell&#146;s story of
    rape without hesitation, fails to investigate the crime, and fails to put a stop to the
    subsequent trial. In contrast, the sheriff at the end of the film has realized the
    injustice that was done to Tom, as well as the injustice of the entire social structure,
    as shown by his refusal to prosecute Boo Radley for Bob Ewell&#146;s murder. The sheriff
    tells Atticus, &quot;An innocent man is dead, and the man responsible for his death now is
    lying under a tree with a knife in his side.&quot; His rejection of the racist system
    wouldn&#146;t have occurred if not for Atticus&#146; willingness to break the stringent
    social code of the south by defending Tom.</small></font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; The true
    beauty of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> lies in Atticus&#146; soft-spoken model of
    advocacy. By working within the society rather than against it, Atticus is able to change
    the hearts and minds of his children, the sheriff, and possibly countless others within
    the community. His seemingly innocuous actions actually serve as a catalyst for changing
    the entire social code of the South, for true social change occurs one person at a time.
    Atticus did what he could to rid his society of racism because he knew that the rule of
    law could be truly impartial and just only after a society had been completely stripped of
    racism.</small></font></p>
