            <p><i><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">All the
            Pretty Horses</font></i><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">,
            now out on video, is a film that may achieve minor cult status,
            as the comments of many who have seen it often include praise
            for its cinematography and editing, summed up as beautifully
            made. Not having read the novel on which it is based, I don't
            know the extent to which its underlying commentary on the criminal
            justice systems in Texas and Mexico is the work of the novel's
            author, Cormac McCarthy, screenwriter Ted Tally, or director
            Billy Bob Thornton. That may be difficult for anyone to determine,
            as the studio is reported to have chopped the director's cut
            from 220 minutes down to 116.</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">The film stars
            Matt Damon and his timid sidekick, played by Henry Thomas, formerly
            the kid sidekick of <i>E.T. - The Extra Terrestrial</i>. Damon's
            character loses the family farm upon the death of his grandfather,
            and the family lawyer, played by Sam Shepard, tells him there
            is no hope of recovery. Facing limited prospects in West Texas
            in 1949 and fleeing the injustices of Texas probate law, the
            duo head south to seek their fortunes in Mexico. There, they
            immediately find themselves caught up in the misfortunes of a
            juvenile runaway, who<img src="images/4-3horse.jpg" border="0" usemap="#4-3horse" height="198" width="300" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="RIGHT" alt="three horsemen" naturalsizeflag="0">
            may have stolen his horse and gun North of the Border.Their first
            mistake is to get drunk with him. (Had this been a more stereotypical
            western, their encounter with Mexican moonshine would have been
            set in a whorehouse, but here it is good clean fun with a peasant
            family and their cute kids.) After a nearly electrifying scene,
            this possible reincarnation of Billy the Kid loses his purloined
            horse and gun, and then steals them back from a Mexican who assumed
            possession of what he may have thought was lost property. Regrettably,
            the Mexican pays for this mistake with his life. (The killer
            kid is played by Lucas Black, the kid who befriended killer Billy
            Bob Thornton in <i>Sling Blade</i> .)</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">I omit subsequent
            romantic plot details as irrelevant to this article (but spoiling
            other plot information for those who have yet to see the film),and
            noting that some of the romantic themes center on loyalty to
            one's <img src="images/2dcdance.jpg" alt="dance" width="204" height="300" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="LEFT" naturalsizeflag="0"> family and friends - a subject
            recently explored in John Denvir's recent PJ article: </font><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><a href="Traffic-Denvir2.htm">No
            One Comes Out Clean in Traffic</a></font><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">.&nbsp; (And, also noting that the
            well publicized comments of <i>Tomb Raider's</i> Angela Jolie
            about the erotic imagination of her husband, Billy Bob Thornton,
            are only weakly validated in <i>Pretty Horses (</i>PG rated sex
            scenes between Damon and Penelope Cruz. But I digress.)</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">Damon, his
            sidekick and the killer kid all end up in a Mexican hoosegow,
            with no trial. Damon reassures the kid that he will be alright
            because Mexico does not have the death penalty. Minutes later,
            in screen time, the kid is dead, having been shot by the local
            police captain at the behest of the vengeful family of the deceased
            Mexican. The two Texans then end up in a Mexican prison,where
            both are nearly killed in separate knifings by a ruthless prison
            gang. Minutes later, in screen time, they are free men, their
            liberty having been purchased by a rich benefactor. Damon's character
            vows to seek extrajudicial restitution for the injustices endured
            by him and his friends. (The film subsequently makes one wonder
            if Robert Redford and Paul Newman had had hostages, whether <i>Butch
            Cassidy and the Sundance Kid </i>would have had a different,
            happier ending.)</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">Damon eventually
            returns to his beloved Texas, immediately kissing the ground,
            now presumably free of the hazards of the Mexican justice system.
            Not in Texas more than two minutes, in screen time, he is arrested
            for suspected horse stealing.</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">Fortunately
            the judge at his arraignment is either kindly or bored or both.
            Played by Bruce Dern, he is so intrigued by the story of Damon's
            exploits that after seeing proof via scars from the bullet wound
            inflicted by Mexican sharpshooters, he dismisses the case. Never
            being the sort to miss an opportunity to say thank you for an
            act of kindness, Damon later goes to the judge's home to say
            howdy. The judge invites him in for philosophical chat (giving
            the plot some closure), harkening back to a simpler time when
            judges could do that sort of thing and not risk violating ethics
            canons.</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Verdana">The film begs
            the question: if you were going to commit murder in 1949 and
            wanted to avoid capital punishment, were you better off doing
            the deed in Texas or Mexico? (I don't mean to assume that any
            but a tiny fraction of murderers engage in this sort of calculus.)
            The answer could depend on who you were planning to kill. Statistics
            show that murderers in death penalty states in the United States
            receive the death penalty at least four times more frequently
            for killing a white person than for the killing of a member of
            a racial minority. Presumably this was even a higher ratio fifty
            years ago. On the other hand, in Mexico the lack of a death penalty
            apparently did not stop honor killings. (Today, there are approximately
            nine vigilante justice killings annually in Mexico). Perhaps
            the answer is that to avoid capital punishment in either country,
            one should avoid killing a person whose family or friends have
            political influence in the community. As noted above, the film
            also suggests that one might receive an acquittal in Texas if
            a plea for mercy is accompanied by a really entertaining explanation.</font></p>
