<br>
                  by Howard M. Wasserman</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The television program <i>The
                  West Wing</i> followed the staff and administration of President
                  Josiah Bartlet, a popular two-term liberal-Democratic president
                  that real Democrats only dream about-imagine a President with
                  Bill Clinton's political skills, Michael Dukakis' policy goals,
                  Jimmy Carter's commitment to monogamy, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan's
                  intellect. The show ended its seven-year run in May 2006 with
                  the close of the Bartlet Administration and the start of the
                  succeeding administration of Democrat Matthew Santos.</font></p>

                  <p><i><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The West Wing</font></i><font size="-1" face="Verdana"> had a long-standing constitutional
                  interest, for no apparent reason, with the rules and procedures
                  for presidential selection and succession. Over seven seasons
                  depicting one two-term presidency (and the start of the succeeding
                  administration), the show presented to a popular audience many
                  of the obvious (and not-so-obvious) contingencies of succession
                  at the top of the executive branch. Consider the following.</font></p>

                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Temporary Presidential Disability</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the cliffhanger from the
                  first to the second season, President Bartlet is wounded in an
                  assassination attempt and is rushed into surgery and placed under
                  general anesthesia. At that moment, the expectation (as has occurred
                  on several real-life occasions) is that the Vice President becomes
                  &quot;acting president&quot; and temporarily assumes the powers
                  and duties of the presidency until the President awakens and
                  is able to discharge his office.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/westwing3.jpg" width="96" height="118" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">Unfortunately,
                  that formal transfer never occurred. Under &sect; 3 of the Twenty-fifth
                  Amendment, the President must transmit a written declaration
                  to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President
                  pro tempore of the Senate stating that he is unable to discharge
                  his powers. But Bartlet never signed any letter prior to being
                  placed under anesthesia. This is understandable, perhaps, as
                  he had just been shot and was being rushed into emergency surgery
                  - it does not leave time (or inclination) to draft a letter to
                  Congress, a point Bartlet's staffers make.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Thus, as a constitutional matter,
                  the executive power never transferred to Vice President John
                  Hoynes. There was a constitutional power vacuum - the executive
                  power remained vested in a wounded and unconscious person. Vice
                  President Hoynes was nominally and presumptively in charge, although
                  he had no actual authority. There also was talk of the unique
                  role that the Secretary of Defense as the &quot;principle assistant&quot;
                  to the President on matters of national security, with the suggestion
                  that the Secretary should wield increased power in the vacuum.
                  Ultimately, everyone - the VP, the National Security Adviser,
                  the Joint Chiefs - looked for guidance to Chief of Staff Leo
                  McGarry, who, it was pointed out, no one voted for.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The power vacuum and who was
                  in charge or not in charge became a subject of continued controversy
                  in later episodes. And it reflected the genuine confusion that
                  surrounded actual assassination attempts, such as the 1981 shooting
                  of President Reagan. But that vacuum was not inevitable (or even
                  likely) under the circumstances. Under &sect; 4 of the Twenty-fifth
                  Amendment, the Vice President and a majority of the cabinet may
                  provide that written notice of the President's temporary disability,
                  devolving power to the Vice President. Once President Bartlet
                  was under anesthesia and his staff had recognized that a proper
                  &sect; 3 transfer had not occurred, Vice President Hoynes and
                  the cabinet would have met and declared Bartlet unable to discharge
                  his duties because under anesthesia, allowing Hoynes formally
                  to assume the executive power.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Of course, that creates less
                  compelling drama than a power vacuum.</font></p>

                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Vice Presidential Resignation</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Toward the end of season four,
                  soon after Bartlet's re-election to a second term, Vice President
                  Hoynes resigned amid revelations of an extra-marital affair and
                  his paramour's plan to write a book revealing confidential information
                  that Hoynes shared as pillow talk. The primary purpose of the
                  Twenty-fifth Amendment, enacted just a few years after the assassination
                  of President Kennedy, was to address the real (and historically
                  regular) occurrence of vice-presidential vacancies. Section Two
                  gives the President the power to nominate a new Vice President,
                  with confirmation by a majority of both houses of Congress.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">President Bartlet wanted to
                  nominate his Secretary of State, but faced opposition from Republican
                  House leadership (Bartlet confronted a Republican-controlled
                  Congress throughout his presidency), which threatened a confirmation
                  fight against the Secretary and several other of Bartlet's preferred
                  choices for the position. The Speaker pushed Bartlet to name
                  a Vice President who was more politically acceptable to House
                  Republications - a conservative Democrat named &quot;Bingo&quot;
                  Bob Russell, who had a reputation for being very cozy with big
                  industry, not very bright or experienced, and more conservative
                  than Bartlet. Bartlet accepted Russell in order to avoid a fight;
                  Russell was confirmed easily. But being out of step with (and
                  not respected by) the administration politically, he was isolated
                  and ignored. Indeed, Bartlet refused to endorse or support Russell
                  when the latter used his new position to launch a bid for the
                  Democratic presidential nomination during the show's sixth season.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It is not clear how realistic
                  such political bargaining would be over a vice presidential nominee.
                  Obviously our actual experience with vice-presidential appointments
                  is limited to President Nixon's appointment of Gerald Ford in
                  1973 and Ford's appointment of Nelson Rockefeller in 1974. Congressional
                  Democrats did not attempt to affect either choice, perhaps recognizing
                  that the President must have the leeway to select a Vice President
                  with whom he is personally and/or politically comfortable. We
                  would hope that the legislative opposition would not demand that
                  its preference supersede the President's. The vice presidency
                  remains a unique constitutional position, both because of the
                  Vice President's role as adviser (particularly more recently)
                  and immediate executive successor. We should hope that Congress
                  does not attempt to create a situation in which politics or policy
                  would change in the event the President dies or becomes disabled.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But political gamesmanship
                  with a vice presidential nominee is not out of the question,
                  just of a different form. House Democrats delayed Rockefeller's
                  confirmation for five months, not hoping to affect the choice,
                  but simply to keep the vice presidency vacant and thus to keep
                  Democratic Speaker Carl Albert next in the line of statutory
                  succession (see below). One also might expect congressional leaders
                  of one party to resist a nominee who could be a serious future
                  presidential candidate-knowing that candidate would have an advantage
                  running four years hence as a sitting Vice President.</font></p>

                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Temporary Disability and
                  Statutory Succession</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Immediately after Vice President
                  Hoynes resigned (but before Bartlet could nominate a replacement),
                  terrorists kidnapped Zoe Bartlet, the President's youngest daughter.
                  Feeling more panicked father than leader of the free world, Bartlet
                  invoked the Twenty-fifth Amendment and again declared himself
                  temporarily unable to discharge his duties. This time, he was
                  able to write and sign the &sect; 3 letter to the Speaker and
                  President pro tem.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Unfortunately, there was no
                  Vice President to act as president under the Twenty-fifth Amendment.
                  Bartlet's action thus triggered not constitutional succession,
                  but the statutory provisions of 3 U.S.C &sect; 19 for succession
                  below the Vice President. Under the current statute, the executive
                  power devolved to Speaker of the House Glenallen Walken, a hawkish
                  conservative Southern Republican.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The drama then focused on how
                  Walken would wield his temporary powers and how a White House
                  staff of Democrats loyal to Bartlet would interact with the new
                  man in the Oval Office. Leo McGarry sat in on Walken's policy
                  and strategy meetings, but found his counsel far less welcome
                  or followed. Walken also began talking about implementing substantive
                  policies-military and domestic-at odds with the agenda of Bartlet
                  and his administration. This led to a confrontation between Josh
                  Lyman, Bartlet's Deputy Chief of Staff, and a Walken staffer
                  about Walken using the situation for political and partisan advantage,
                  with the Walken staffer accusing Lyman of holding a &quot;craven&quot;
                  view of politics.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Zoe Bartlet was found after
                  72 hours, after which the President unilaterally reassumed the
                  executive power by sending a second letter to the Speaker and
                  President pro tem declaring that he was once again able to discharge
                  his duties.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Many legal commentators, including
                  me, have argued that having legislative leaders at the head of
                  the statutory line of executive succession is unconstitutional,
                  unwise, or both. The scenario depicted on <i>The West Wing</i>
                  demonstrates why.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Because members of Congress
                  are prohibited from serving in the Executive Branch, Walken resigned
                  the Speakership and his House seat in order to become acting
                  president for a brief period. After three days of minding the
                  store, Walken did not return to Congress. He became a private
                  citizen, out of public service - the reward for his stepping
                  into the breach in a national emergency.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">On the other hand, the President
                  was replaced (however briefly) by his chief political rival,
                  with a different agenda and the opportunity (and perhaps desire)
                  to pursue that agenda for political advantage. If nothing else,
                  the show depicted the strange and unworkable situation created
                  by an acting president in the Oval Office surrounded by West
                  Wing staff not inclined to help him carry out any agenda and
                  on whom he is not inclined to depend. And there is the genuine
                  risk that someone would use the opportunity for partisan gain,
                  especially if in office longer than 72 hours. Perhaps this fear
                  is craven - but politics occasionally are.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The myriad problems with legislative
                  succession contrast with the relative smoothness of the alternative-succession
                  by the cabinet officers who already were helping the President
                  wield executive power, historically beginning with the Secretary
                  of State. On <i>The West Wing</i>, that means the acting president
                  would have been the very person Bartlet was hoping to make Vice
                  President.</font></p>

                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Replacing a Vice President-&quot;Elect&quot;</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Appropriately, the series ended
                  with one final foray into executive succession - replacing a
                  candidate for executive office who dies prior to Inauguration.
                  The dramatic move became necessary with the December 2005 death
                  of actor John Spencer, who played Leo McGarry.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">During the final season, McGarry
                  was the Democratic nominee for Vice President, the experienced
                  veteran providing the younger Santos with gravitas. McGarry suffered
                  a heart attack and dies on Election Night, several hours before
                  polls close on the West Coast and ten hours before Santos was
                  declared the winner of the popular votes in states totaling 272
                  electoral votes, enough to give him the presidency.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Of course, formally it is the
                  votes of electors in the Electoral College and the acceptance
                  of those College votes by Congress that chooses the President
                  and Vice President. That process takes approximately two months
                  beyond Election Day.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The question was how Santos
                  and the Democratic Party would and should select McGarry's replacement
                  as Vice President. The procedure for doing this in fact involves
                  a complex and uncertain interaction of several federal constitutional
                  provisions, federal statutes, and state laws, and independent
                  actions by the states, the two major political parties, the Electoral
                  College, and Congress. As recently as 1994, the Senate Judiciary
                  Committee held hearings to clarify how the law should handle
                  the death of a presidential (or vice presidential) candidate
                  prior to Inauguration.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Santos argued that it would
                  be patently undemocratic for him or the Democratic Party to instruct
                  Democratic electors to vote for a new candidate or to have unnamed
                  and unknown electors select a Vice President who never stood
                  before the American people for democratic consideration. This
                  reflects a very modern view of the Electoral College-its original
                  design entailed independent electors with discretion to select
                  the best people for the jobs of President and Vice President,
                  without regard to the public will.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Instead, Santos waited until
                  after Inauguration to do anything. On January 20, McGarry would
                  not &quot;qualify&quot; for his vice presidential office under
                  the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, because of death,
                  creating a vacancy in the Vice Presidency. Santos then would
                  nominate a replacement under the Twenty-fifth Amendment, who
                  would be subject to approval by both houses of Congress.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This is one (the writers suggest
                  only) democratically legitimate way to find a new Vice President.
                  The series ended following the inauguration ceremony with the
                  understanding that this is what would happen.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But, in truth, a great deal
                  must have occurred (or not occur) behind the scenes under federal
                  and state law to allow the process to play out this way. Any
                  change in the underlying process might produce a very different
                  outcome - Democratic President Santos with Republican Vice President
                  Ray Sullivan, who had been the GOP candidate for Vice President.
                  Sullivan was a conservative Republican and darling of the religious
                  right.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">First, Santos and the Democratic
                  Party must have declined to place a new vice presidential candidate
                  to replace McGarry before the Electoral College, which they did
                  on the stated belief that naming a substitute would be undemocratic.
                  But, in fact, both national parties retain the power to name
                  a new nominee in this circumstance and to instruct or urge electors
                  committed to their ticket to cast votes for the substitute. This
                  happened in 1912, when James Sherman, President William Howard
                  Taft's running mate, died just before Election Day and the Republican
                  Party urged its electors to vote for Nicholas Butler (of course,
                  the Republicans received only eight electoral votes in that year's
                  three-way race, thus the electors were not choosing the person
                  who would become Vice President).</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Such a switch may have been
                  impossible, however, for electors from states with &quot;faithless
                  elector laws,&quot; laws purporting to bind presidential electors
                  to vote a certain way in the College. Some laws require an elector
                  to vote either for the winner of the state's popular election
                  or for the person named as the party's candidate in the general
                  election. Either type would compel those electors to vote for
                  McGarry.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The problem arises if those
                  bound electors still cast votes for McGarry, but other Democratic-committed
                  electors vote for the DNC's new choice. This would deprive any
                  candidate of a majority in the Electoral College. The vice presidential
                  election would be thrown into the Republican-controlled Senate,
                  which, under the Twelfth Amendment, would choose between the
                  two top vote-getters in the Electoral College (likely Republican
                  Sullivan and the DNC's substitute). The Senate majority may have
                  been tempted to select Sullivan simply because it had the votes.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Second, in the absence of a
                  DNC-designated replacement, Democrat-committed electors all must
                  have cast their College votes for McGarry, even though he was
                  dead, rather than for some other candidate. If, in the confusion,
                  as few as three electors failed to vote for McGarry, denying
                  him a majority, the election again would have been thrown to
                  the Senate, with the same possible outcome.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Third, if all Democratic electors
                  voted for McGarry, Congress must have accepted and counted those
                  votes even though he was dead. There is precedent for Congress
                  not recognizing such votes-in 1872, Congress declined to accept
                  three electoral votes cast for presidential candidate Horace
                  Greeley, who had died between Election Day and the meeting of
                  the Electoral College. Had a majority in Congress disregarded
                  McGarry votes, the VP election again would have gone to the Senate.
                  Moreover, in this circumstance, the Senate's only choice would
                  have been the Republican, Sullivan; because he was the only candidate
                  to receive valid votes in the Electoral College (McGarry's votes
                  having been rejected by Congress), his would be the only name
                  submitted to the Senate contingency election.</font></p>

                  <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A Final Note</font></b></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">For seven years, <i>The West
                  Wing</i> successfully dramatized, for popular consumption, the
                  vagaries and defects in our structural constitutional schemes,
                  defects that otherwise come to light only amid real-life tragedy.
                  Beyond the quality of the show (it earned four Emmy Awards for
                  Best Drama and 25 Emmies in all), it will be missed as a vehicle
                  for popular understanding of, and perhaps real political change
                  in, the uncertain and problematic processes of presidential selection
                  and succession.</font></p>
