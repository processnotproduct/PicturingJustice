                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In this age of terrorism and
                  uncertainty, we surely must rely more than ever on our neighbors,
                  yet we are more than ever unlikely to know them, or know much
                  about them. The fear of the stranger is never more potent than
                  when that stranger is someone in one's own home town, someone
                  who should share one's values and dreams, on whom one should
                  be able to rely in times of need and whom one should also expect
                  to assist when necessary. We expect to know our neighbors if
                  we live in small towns or intimate communities in large cities,
                  but we expect not to know them if we live in anonymous high-rises.
                  Indeed, we so prize our privacy that we resist those who attempt
                  to make friends. They could be well meaning but nosy, but they
                  could also be serial killers. People disappear daily, and their
                  neighbors tell police, &quot;We didn't know much about her. She
                  kept to herself. One day we just didn't see her anymore.&quot;
                  Kitty Genovese's lonely, terrifying death on a New York street
                  in 1964, within earshot of neighbors who did nothing, not even
                  call the police, and dramatized in the 1975 film <i>Death Scream</i>,
                  symbolized our turn toward willful ignorance. Someone we thought
                  we knew is taken away in handcuffs, and the obligatory interviews
                  on the six o'clock news reveal, &quot;He was such a good boy!
                  Always went to church! Always visited his mother!&quot;<br>
<br>
                  Not surprisingly, Hollywood has explored our strange relationship
                  with our neighbors in numerous films and television shows, to
                  the point that certain neighbor personas are now archetypal,
                  if not clich&eacute;d, as are the legal issues that involve neighbors.
                  The phrase &quot;good fences make good neighbors&quot; has a
                  great deal of truth, and not just because those fences protect
                  our children from falling into our neighbors' pools. From the
                  classic fifties comedy <i>Dennis the Menace</i> to the nineties
                  hit <i>Family Matters</i> television series highlight the long-suffering
                  neighbor who must deal with a destructive and nosy child. <i>I
                  Love Lucy</i> had faithful neighbors who were also close friends,
                  as did the Jackie Gleason vehicle <i>The Honeymooners</i>. The
                  popular sitcom <i>Home Improvement</i> features a neighbor with
                  all the answers. Comedies about neighborhoods are perennially
                  popular with viewers. They create a friendly, reliable world
                  that does not necessarily reflect our own, but that we yearn
                  for, a world that seems secure, and predictable, and to a great
                  extent desirable.<br>
<br>
                  Series like <i>American Gothic</i>, on the other hand, remind
                  us that the smallest, friendliest seeming town hides secrets.
                  Like Shirley Jackson's short story &quot;<i>The Lottery</i>&quot;,
                  shows like <i>American Gothic</i> give us the permanent creeps:
                  we suspect that somewhere in this country, there really is a
                  town where evil has overtaken good. Isn't that what Stephen King
                  keeps telling us? In particular, the small Southern or mid-Western
                  town comes in for its share of suspicion. <i>My Cousin Vinny</i>
                  (1992) derived much of its humor from the juxtaposition of New
                  York and Southern culture, and New York didn't always win out.
                  Fred Gwynne's bewilderment at Joe Pesci's pronunciation of &quot;two
                  youths&quot; is worth the price of the film. And as Judge Haller,
                  Gwynne teaches Lawyer Gambini (Pesci) some rules about courtroom
                  decorum he'll never forget. But Southern towns aren't always
                  so amusing: <i>In the Heat of the Night</i> (1967) is the archetypal
                  example of the clash between prejudice and honor, a story in
                  which a local policeman must decide to arrest his neighbor, a
                  fellow officer, in the interests of justice.<br>
<br>
                  The notion that our neighbors have things to hide is a popular
                  theme in Hollywood. <i>In Fright Night</i>, a teenager begins
                  to believe that his new neighbors are vampires and he carries
                  out numerous investigations (also known as trespasses) in order
                  to prove himself right. Teenagers with time on their hands, usually
                  during summer vacation, are notorious for investigating empty
                  houses and bothering retired people, the local &quot;witch&quot;
                  and anybody who doesn't fit in. For years, movies had obligatory
                  scenes in which children bothered the town eccentrics, sometimes
                  played for laughs as in <i>Meet Me in St. Louis</i> (1944), and
                  sometimes not, as in <i>To Kill a Mockingbird </i>(1962).<br>
<br>
                  In some movies, the adults take matters into their own hands
                  once they take the children seriously as in the Tom Hanks comedy
                  <i>The 'Burbs</i>, when they begin to suspect that their new
                  neighbors are up to no good, especially since the former occupants
                  of the house vanished without a trace, as does one of their present
                  neighbors. The vigilante justice that is a major part of these
                  &quot;Neighborhood Watch&quot; investigations indicates that
                  we have little faith in the ability of the police to investigate
                  our suspicions, even if we can convince the folks in blue to
                  take them at face value. We know from countless courtroom dramas
                  that the police cannot intervene until a crime has been committed,
                  by which time it is normally too late. Indeed, the theme of many
                  movies of the week as well as Hollywood blockbusters such as
                  <i>What Lies Beneath</i> (2000), is precisely that the police
                  are legally impotent, and that we must protect ourselves, because
                  the people we expect to protect us (the police, the district
                  attorneys, and the judges) simply cannot do so. That's what the
                  NRA keeps telling us, anyway. In the Dan Ackroyd black comedy
                  <i>Getting Away With Murder </i>(1996), Jack Lambert (Ackroyd)
                  believes he is living next door to a Nazi war criminal (Jack
                  Lemmon). Because he cannot convince the authorities that this
                  is so, he decides to deal with the man himself, a theme that
                  we see taken seriously in such films as <i>Death and the Maiden</i>
                  (1994) and <i>The Execution </i>(1985). In <i>Rear Window</i>
                  (1954), the granddaddy of all nosy neighbor flicks, the immobilized
                  James Stewart details the cool and beautiful Grace Kelly to do
                  his leg work (literally) when he suspects his neighbor of a murder.
                  If only Hitchcock had known how often his theme was to be reused
                  over the next decades (&quot;But, Mom, I know our new neighbors
                  are up to something!&quot; &quot;Now, mind your own business,
                  Timmy, and do your homework.&quot; Organ music swelling up in
                  the background. Ominous sounds of digging. Weird laughter. Small
                  pets disappearing suddenly in the night.)<br>
<br>
                  Hollywood particularly loves the Nazis Among Us theme, and not
                  just because it may actually be true. The movies that gave us
                  Nazis in patrician New England in <i>The Stranger</i> (1946)
                  also gave us Nazis in Manhattan in <i>Marathon Man</i> (1976),
                  <i>Music Box</i> (1989), <i>Descending Angel </i>(1990), <i>Death
                  and the Maiden</i> and <i>The Execution</i>, all war crimes films
                  made more believable because of the real life trials of John
                  Demjanjuk, Adolph Eichmann, and Klaus Barbie. Except for <i>Music
                  Box</i>, all of these films require the intervention of laypersons
                  to bring the wrongdoer to justice, or to make a decision not
                  to do so. Although lawyers play parts in some of these films,
                  most notably <i>Death and the Maiden</i> and <i>The Execution</i>,
                  in few do they have the heroic role. Indeed, the lawyers in the
                  latter three films seem to most non-lawyers to act in contravention
                  of justice, to prevent evildoers from being brought to account,
                  to protect the evil neighbors, rather than to root them out.<br>
<br>
                  Nazis (and later Communists) are only one of the hidden threats
                  that may face us in our neighborhoods. The neighbor as serial
                  killer threat has recently emerged as a favorite, particularly
                  since FBI profilers have impressed upon us that serial killers
                  are not easily recognizable loonies. In fact, they are usually
                  the boy (or girl) next door. Mark Harmon was cast against type
                  as Ted Bundy in <i>The Deliberate Stranger</i> (1986), perhaps
                  the U. S.'s most notorious serial killer, but Bundy himself was
                  a handsome, charming man. Harmon also played a serial killer
                  in the 1991 remake of the Hitchcock thriller <i>Shadow of a Doubt</i>,
                  in which he is arguably even more creepy than Joseph Cotton in
                  the original (1943) version. The very neighborliness of the serial
                  killer is what allows many of them to blend into the ordinariness
                  of everyday life, coupled with our increasing unwillingness to
                  get involved, our genuine lack of knowledge about those around
                  us, indeed our very uncertainty about what constitutes &quot;normality.&quot;
                  In these days of unusual religious views, differing dress codes,
                  a reluctance to exchange even the most perfunctory greetings
                  on the street, is it any wonder that many of us refuse to ask
                  the most basic questions about our neighbors' daily or nocturnal
                  habits? Innocent questions might be seen as harassment. Who needs
                  confrontation? Anyone might have a concealed weapon, and might
                  be willing to use it. And fear breeds more fear.<br>
<br>
                  Meanwhile, &quot;normal&quot; people go unchallenged, even when
                  we have some sneaking doubts about whether their behavior is
                  in fact entirely normal, until one day, we hear that the nice
                  man next door, the deacon of the church, has been arrested for
                  possession of child pornography, or the vice president of the
                  bank has been hauled in for sexual harassment, or the helpful
                  home economics teacher has been convicted of raping a fourteen
                  year old boy. These people live in our neighborhood? Yes, and
                  they've begun to reproduce-cineamatically speaking. After a rash
                  of serial killer movies-<i>The Killer Next Door</i> (2001); <i>Through
                  the Eyes of a Killer</i> (1992)(Richard Dean Anderson is a carpenter
                  who builds himself a secret passageway so he can spy on his client/victim),
                  we had a rash of female sexual predator conspiracy to murder
                  movies (<i>Stay the Night</i> (1992); <i>To Die For</i> (1995);
                  <i>Murder in New Hampshire</i> (1991); <i>Seduced By Madness</i>
                  (1996)). We've had female serial killer movies (<i>Black Widow
                  Murders</i> (1993); <i>Wife, Mother, Murderer</i> (1991); <i>Overkill</i>
                  (1992) and <i>Monster</i> (2003), both about Aileen Wuornos).
                  With the possible exception of Wuornos, none of the real life
                  people depicted was necessarily identifiable as dangerous to
                  the average person. Just your average normal, daily dog walking,
                  Saturday night beer drinking, Sunday church going, weekly lawn
                  cutting, annual Girl Scout cookie-buying serial killer. <br>
<br>
                  In some cases, fictional neighborhoods can be confining to the
                  point that the scriptwriters clearly decide to scrap them for
                  more liberating venues. <i>Murder She Wrote</i>'s Jessica Fletcher
                  clearly needed to move out of Cabot Cove for the more sophisticated
                  and grittier locations of New York, Los Angeles and London, not
                  just because Maine was sleepy. It was also because at the rate
                  the show was going, it was fairly clear that half of her neighbors
                  were homicidal lunatics and the other half were their victims.
                  This is not to say that fictional neighborhoods cannot reflect
                  truth. Certainly Agatha Christie made a great point of showing
                  us that her sleuth Miss Jane Marple detected crime using the
                  small neighborhood of &quot;St. Mary Mead&quot; as a lens through
                  which to view the larger world. Everyone in her tiny village
                  had an analog somewhere in the world; it was simply a matter
                  of finding the similarity.<br>
<br>
                  Of course, Nazis Among Us quickly became (literally) Aliens Among
                  Us in the 1950s once Kenneth Arnold spotted those flying saucers,
                  although we were never quite certain whether those aliens were
                  Communists or extra-terrestrials. While <i>My Favorite Martian</i>,
                  <i>3d Rock from the Sun</i>, and <i>Alf</i> played the idea of
                  neighbors next door as real aliens for laughs, some Americans
                  truly believe that aliens do dwell among us. The movies that
                  depicted popularity of fifties movies such as <i>I Married a
                  Monster from Outer Space</i> (1958) and <i>Invasion of the Body
                  Snatchers</i> (1956) translated fairly easily into <i>I Married
                  a Monster</i> (1998) and <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>
                  (1978) and <i>Body Snatchers </i>(1993), films which represented
                  Communism for some people and real alien invasion for others.
                  Indeed, the invasion narrative is now such a part of our culture
                  that both Hollywood and independent filmmakers now parody it
                  easily: <i>Evolution</i> (2001), <i>Galaxy Quest</i> (1999),
                  and the much underrated <i>Top of the Food Chain</i> a/k/a <i>Invasion</i>
                  (1999). Is it safe to go out at night? Many of us believe the
                  law no longer protects us adequately. It's better to stay home
                  with our security systems and our pay-per-view. For myself, after
                  assessing the risk, I think I'll still go out at night, to plays
                  and to concerts and to movies, I'll still talk to my neighbors,
                  even if they think I'm a little bit of a nut. I want to rely
                  on them, and I want them to rely on me, even if I don't keep
                  watching the skies.<br>
