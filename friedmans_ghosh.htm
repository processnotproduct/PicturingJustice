                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">by Shubha Ghosh</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The appeal of the movie <i>Capturing
                  the Friedmans</i> rests on two obsessions in popular culture.
                  The first is the fascination with family drama, especially ones
                  involving dysfunction and sexual trauma. The second is the interest
                  in legal cases, especially ones involving miscarriages of justice
                  or, at least, ambiguity in the result of a legal process. Director
                  Andrew Jarecki delivers on both counts and hence the almost unanimous
                  rave that he has created a masterpiece with his first film. I
                  respectfully dissent.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><img src="images/friedman1.jpg" width="179" height="141" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">We
                  are told early on that the arraignment of Arnold and Jesse Friedman
                  in 1987 was the first time that a television camera was allowed
                  into a courtroom in Nassau County. And so we witness the beginning
                  of voyeurism in the courtroom, the birth of law as spectacle.
                  The need to watch and be watched explains why the Friedmans themselves
                  recorded many of the family meltdowns and agreed to allow Mr.
                  Jarecki to include their home movies as part of his documentary.
                  They may have been motivated by the need to exonerate themselves
                  or reopen the case, as Jesse Friedman contends. But the need
                  to be seen seems the primary motivation of this family. The Friedmans
                  were, on the surface, a typical middle class household in Long
                  Island that was put under extensive scrutiny as a result of the
                  hundreds of charges of child molestation brought against the
                  father, Arnold, and the youngest son, Jesse. In many ways, they
                  can never escape public scrutiny, and it is understandable that
                  once the public begins to stare, it is hard to ignore or avoid
                  the gaze. Only Seth Friedman, the middle son who did not participate
                  in the documentary, seems to have been able to flee the limelight.
                  The rest of the family seems captured in a need to constantly
                  perform and replay the traumatic episodes from 1987-1988.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But what do we get from watching?
                  Half an hour into the film, when Emily Friedman, Arnold's wife,
                  describes her revulsion at learning that her husband collected
                  child pornography and was possibly a pedophile, I felt dirty.
                  The documentary itself had turned into pornography, not because
                  of the lurid details or the occasional shots of child rape, but
                  because this poor family lay emotionally naked in front of me
                  and I had no idea how to react. At a cerebral level, I knew that
                  Arnold was guilty of something, perhaps only of possessing child
                  pornography and possibly having sexual relations with young boys
                  (maybe even his brother) at some point in his life. I also knew
                  that perhaps all of the charges against Arnold and Jesse were
                  the result of either hysteria or hypnotically induced memory.
                  But at an emotional level, I kept asking myself why do we need
                  to know all this, why should we be so fascinated.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">On one level, <i>Capturing
                  the Friedmans</i> fits into a line of films that expose the sickness
                  of middle class suburban life in the U.S. The Academy bestowed
                  its highest honor on one film in this genre when <i>American
                  Beauty</i> was given the award for Best Picture in 1999. However,
                  the films of Todd Solondz, particularly <i>Happiness</i>, are
                  the true masterpieces. There is much in common between <i>Happiness</i>
                  and <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i>. Both occur in the weird backwaters
                  near New York City, <i>Happiness</i> in suburban New Jersey,
                  <i>Friedmans</i> in suburban Long Island. Both involve a seemingly
                  stable and respectable paterfamilias exposed as a pedophile.
                  Both see the social and familial dysfunction as rooted in repressed
                  homosexuality and a repressive heterosexuality. But <i>Happiness</i>
                  has so much more edge, largely because it is fictional. In contrast,
                  <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i> is so real that it simply becomes
                  creepy to watch or even write about. The real sickness being
                  exposed is that we are willing to pay and watch this mirror reflection
                  of what we all may really be.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The mirror reflects not only
                  the sickness of suburban life, but also the disturbing workings
                  of the legal system. Arnold and Jesse Friedman were convicted
                  almost exclusively on the basis of testimonial evidence. Arnold
                  pled guilty to make Jesse's trial easier, and Jesse pled guilty
                  because of the fear that he would fare badly in a trial, especially
                  in light of his father's guilty plea. Post-McMartin, it is easy
                  to say that they would have been better off going to trial and
                  pointing out the lack of physical evidence and the implausibility
                  of the testimony. Pre-McMartin, however, the hysteria that child
                  sex abuse generated and perhaps the state of lawyering in Nassau
                  County at the time seemed to preclude that stratagem. As a law
                  professor, I was disturbed by the ease with which the state was
                  able to imprison these two men, one of whom was probably totally
                  innocent, the other guilty of perhaps only displaced and repressed
                  sexual tendencies. Many commentators have compared the movie
                  to <i>Rashomon</i>, with its play of multiple perspectives on
                  a set of facts known to the audience. In fact, <i>Capturing the
                  Friedmans</i> is not about multiple perspectives; it is about
                  the elusiveness of facts in the legal system, the slippery line
                  between what we know as fact and what we think we know as fact.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The best example of this theme
                  is a five minute or so segment roughly two-thirds of the way
                  into the film, in which the director cuts between Jesse Friedman
                  and his lawyer Mr. Panaro. We are shown earlier that Mr. Panaro's
                  office is a few doors down from what appears to be a strip club
                  and an adult bookstore in Massapequa, Long Island. He slickly
                  dismisses Arnold Friedman as a pedophile, child molestor, and
                  abuser of his son Jesse. Mr. Panaro is clearly replaying his
                  defense in the case. Cut to Jesse who categorically denies every
                  one of Mr. Panaro's allegations about child molestation and abuse
                  by his father. This discrepancy is not simply a matter of perspective.
                  It is about the plaything of lawyers: facts, perceptions, and
                  beliefs. Director Andrew Jarecki, wittingly or accidentally,
                  reveals a great deal of what the legal system is built upon.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There are, however, great movies
                  that expose the inadequacies of our legal system. Errol Morris'
                  <i>The Thin Blue Line</i>, about a wrongful death penalty conviction
                  in Texas, is a classic because not only does the director capture
                  the confession of the true killer on tape, he also demonstrates
                  how the mistake could have occurred. Andrew Jarecki, on the other
                  hand, exposes, at best, sloppiness in the legal system. Instead
                  of a solid critique of the legal system, we see, presented before
                  us, a truly dysfunctional family, which , like every family,
                  is dysfunctional in its own way. What we should see is how hysteria
                  and facts are fungible commodities in the legal system. In an
                  age of terror alerts, profiling, and detention of aliens for
                  possible terrorist activities, it is sad that Mr. Jarecki did
                  not provide us with a film more reflective of what we should
                  be noticing in our times.</font></p>
